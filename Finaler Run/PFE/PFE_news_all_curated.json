        "description": "Albert Bourla said Pfizer is being \"frugal\" with investments because of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, said tariffs are preventing the company from making \"tremendous investments\" in the US.Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for Concordia SummitPfizer's CEO said tariff uncertainty is hindering the company from making big investments in the US.Albery Bourla said there could be \"tremendous investments\" in R&D and manufacturing in the US.Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical products, which have been exempted thus far.Pfizer's CEO said President Donald Trump's tariffs and uncertainty are holding the company back from making \"tremendous investments\" in the US.In a first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, chief executive Albert Bourla was asked what incentives he would want to see in tariff negotiations that would make him increase manufacturing investments in the US.\"If I know that there will not be tariffs and a heavy certainty, then there are tremendous investments that can happen in this country, both in R&D and manufacturing,\" Bourla said.\"And in periods of uncertainty, everybody is controlling their cost as we are doing,\" Bourla said. He added that Pfizer is being \"very frugal\" with investments so it can be \"prepared for any day.\"Bourla previously said his plan to counter Trump's tariffs is to move manufacturing to the US.\"We have 13 manufacturing sites in the US right now, up and running,\" Bourla said at TD Cowen's annual healthcare conference in March.\"So we have all the capabilities here, and the manufacturing sites are operating in good capacity right now. It's not that they are not, but if something happens, we will try to mitigate by transferring from manufacturing sites outside, to manufacturing sites here, the things that can be transferred quickly,\" Bourla added.Pfizer's finance chief, Dave Denton, said in the same call that the tariffs currently in place are expected to cost the company about $150 million in 2025.Pharmaceutical products were exempted from the sweeping 10% tariffs Trump announced on April 2. However, he said earlier this month that he plans to impose pharmaceutical tariffs to get the companies to move manufacturing to the US.\"All I have to do is impose a tariff, the more, the faster they move in. The higher the tariff — it's very simple — it's inversely proportional; the higher the tariff, the faster they come. And yeah, we're going to be doing that,\" Trump said.The possibility of pharmaceutical tariffs has prompted reactions from big voices in the business, some of whom have warned of higher prices.The CEO of Pfizer's competitor, AstraZeneca, said in an earnings call on Tuesday that the company could shift some manufacturing to the US if pharmaceutical tariffs are imposed.Pascal Soriot said AstraZeneca could move the manufacturing of its products intended for the US market from Europe to the US.US drugmaker Merck said Tuesday that it had started the construction of a $1 billion commercial production facility in Delaware. Merck's CEO said in a Tuesday press release that the facility represents the company's \"continued commitment\" to manufacturing in the US market. Separately, billionaire investor Mark Cuban said in March that drugs from his company, Cost Plus Drugs, will likely get more expensive if tariffs on India are imposed.Representatives for Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "\"I was expecting him probably to win,\" Pfizer's CEO Albert Bourla said of President Donald Trump's election victory.Leigh Vogel via Getty Images; Carl Court via Getty ImagesPfizer's CEO said he may move manufacturing back to the US in response to Donald Trump's tariffs.Albert Bourla said he was not surprised by Trump's victory in November.Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO, said on Monday that the company may move overseas drug manufacturing back to the US if President Donald Trump's tariffs affect it.Bourla was speaking at TD Cowen's annual healthcare conference when he was asked about the impact Trump's tariffs could have on Pfizer's operations.While most of Pfizer's generic drugs are produced overseas, Bourla said the company has a large manufacturing network in the US.\"We have 13 manufacturing sites in the US right now, up and running,\" Bourla said, adding that some facilities are \"mega, mega sites.\"\"So we have all the capabilities here, and the manufacturing sites are operating in good capacity right now. It's not that they are not, but if something happens, we will try to mitigate by transferring from manufacturing sites outside, to manufacturing sites here, the things that can be transferred quickly,\" Bourla continued.Bourla also said at the conference that he was not surprised by Trump's victory in November.\"I was expecting him probably to win. It was very big win,\" Bourla said, adding that there will be \"risks and opportunities\" with the new administration.\"But the important thing is, what are you doing about it? And what are you doing about it, is you try to influence the environment. From our perspective, the whole pharma industry and us as Pfizer, try to stay as close to the administration,\" Bourla added.On Monday, Trump said the White House would proceed with its plans to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Tuesday. The tariffs were originally meant to take effect in early February but were delayed after both countries promised to strengthen their border security.The Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on China last month and said it would levy an additional 10% tariff starting Tuesday. In February 2024, Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo he would introduce tariffs of more than 60% on Chinese goods if he won the election.\"When it comes to China, it's not affecting us. As Pfizer, we haven't any reliance on China right now, nor Canada or Mexico,\" Bourla told CNBC in an interview on February 18.\"We are waiting to see how that could play out with the tariffs in places that have not been announced yet,\" Bourla added.Representatives for Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider \"I was expecting him probably to win,\" Pfizer's CEO Albert Bourla said of President Donald Trump's election victory.Leigh Vogel via Getty Images; Carl Court via Getty ImagesPfizer's CEO said he may move manufacturing back to the US in response to Donald Trump's tariffs.Albert Bourla said he was not surprised by Trump's victory in November.Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO, said on Monday that the company may move overseas drug manufacturing back to the US if President Donald Trump's tariffs affect it.Bourla was speaking at TD Cowen's annual healthcare conference when he was asked about the impact Trump's tariffs could have on Pfizer's operations.While most of Pfizer's generic drugs are produced overseas, Bourla said the company has a large manufacturing network in the US.\"We have 13 manufacturing sites in the US right now, up and running,\" Bourla said, adding that some facilities are \"mega, mega sites.\"\"So we have all the capabilities here, and the manufacturing sites are operating in good capacity right now.
