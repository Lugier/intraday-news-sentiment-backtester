Date: 2025-06-11 20:33:37
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title mentions "Capital One strikes a positive tone," but without any specifics, the magnitude and surprise factor are low.

Date: 2025-06-09 16:51:24

Date: 2025-06-08 19:21:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General, particularly after a similar federal case was dropped, presents a negative surprise for COF.

Date: 2025-06-05 23:19:14
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While a $30M stock grant is substantial, it's primarily an internal corporate matter related to compensation and the Discover integration.

Date: 2025-05-19 13:43:28

Title: Capital One just bought Discover. Here's what it means for their customers.
Date: 2025-05-19 11:24:04

Date: 2025-05-19 01:07:02
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The finalization of the Discover acquisition has been long anticipated and approved by regulators, suggesting it is already priced in.

Title: 2 of the world's largest credit card companies just merged
Date: 2025-05-18 22:39:32
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The acquisition was already announced in February, meaning the market has likely already priced it in.

Date: 2025-05-09 00:10:35
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: A dividend declaration of $0.60 is unlikely to significantly move the price of COF within 60 minutes because it is a routine corporate action that is likely already priced in.

Date: 2025-04-25 00:00:11
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses Discover's (DFS) earnings and pending acquisition by Capital One (COF). While Discover's "stable" consumer behavior and improved credit metrics are generally positive, the earnings release is from Discover, not Capital One.

Date: 2025-04-21 23:35:56
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: An "Earnings Preview" is generally considered anticipatory and lacks concrete quantifiable data at this point.
