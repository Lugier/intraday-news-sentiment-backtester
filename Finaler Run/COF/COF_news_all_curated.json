Fifteen months after it was announced, Capital One’s $35 billion acquisition of Discover is official. The deal, finalized Sunday (May 18), creates the largest credit card issuer in terms of loan volume in the U.S. “This deal brings together two innovative, mission-driven companies that together are poised to deliver breakthrough products and experiences to consumers, businesses and merchants,” Capital One Founder/CEO Richard D. Fairbank said in a news release, thanking Discover’s board, executives and interim CEO Michael Shepherd for their support. “Through the efforts of thousands of associates across Capital One and Discover, we are well-positioned to continue our quest to change banking for good for millions of customers,” Fairbank added. Capital One announced in February 2024 that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discover. The deal was approved by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on April 18 of this year and by the Delaware State Bank Commissioner last December. Weeks before the acquisition was finalized, a pair of Democratic lawmakers wrote to the Federal Reserve asking it to reconsider its approval. In a letter to the central bank, Rep. Maxine Waters of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued that the decision to “rubber stamp” the deal would harm consumers and small businesses. “Merchants would have no choice but to accept the terms dictated by Capital One’s network, since they need to access the customers of the largest credit card issuer in the country,” the letter said. Writing about the merger soon after it was announced, PYMNTS noted its potential benefit to paycheck-to-paycheck consumers. As for Capital One, that report added, it gains scale with the merger’s completion, by employing the capabilities that Discover has been building or have already been built, stretching across cross-border commerce and payments in general. Because Discover has its own network, Capital One gains the ability to more firmly cement a drive to compete against Visa and Mastercard. The report also quotes Fairbank’s comments from when the deal was first announced, saying the acquisition would “build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies.” In other Capital One news, the company recently agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by depositors for $455 million. The plaintiffs in that case had accused Capital One of falsely promising high interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts while offering better rates to new customers of its similarly named 360 Performance Savings accounts.

Capital One will reportedly pay $425 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of cheating savings account depositors. That’s according to a report by Reuters on Friday (May 16), citing court documents. The proposed settlement comes amid similar litigation against Capital One by New York State, and as the banking giant finalizes its merger with Discover. Customers had sued Capital One, accusing the company of falsely promising high interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts while offering much better rates to new customers on its 360 Performance Savings accounts. According to the settlement, Reuters said, Capital One will pay 360 Savings depositors $300 million to cover interest they could have gotten with 360 Performance Savings accounts. The bank will also pay $125 million in interest to depositors who still have 360 Savings accounts. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing, Reuters noted. PYMNTS has contacted Capital One for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. The settlement comes just days after New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a similar suit against Capital One, again alleging that the company misled customers about the existence of its higher interest savings account. And that suit followed one from January by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, the regulator dropped that case in February as the White House massively scaled back the CFPB’s enforcement efforts. James’ lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed the 360 Savings accounts as having “one of the nation’s best savings rates” while keeping the interest rates “artificially low” as rates climbed around the country. “Capital One assured high returns with no catches, then pulled the rug out from under their customers and hoped nobody would notice,” James said in a news release. “Big banks are not allowed to cheat their customers with false advertising and misleading promises.” Capital One has said that the company “strongly” disagrees with the attorney general’s allegations and will “vigorously defend” itself in court. “Our flagship 360 Performance Savings product was marketed widely, including on national television, and has always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions,” the company said in an emailed statement to PYMNTS last week. The suit and the settlement came just days ahead of Capital One’s planned closing of its $35 billion acquisition of Discover, which was expected to become final Sunday (May 18). Earlier this month, a pair of Democratic lawmakers wrote to the Federal Reserve asking the central bank to rethink its approval of that deal. “Merchants would have no choice but to accept the terms dictated by Capital One’s network, since they need to access the customers of the largest credit card issuer in the country,” Rep. Maxine Waters of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote. The post Capital One Reportedly Settling Savings Account Suit for $425 Million appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Capital One Wednesday (May 14), alleging the bank misled its customers about the existence of a savings account that provided higher interest. The lawsuit’s allegations are similar to those made by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a case the agency later dropped after a change in leadership, the Office of the New York State Attorney General said in a Wednesday press release. The release added that James seeks to “ensure that Capital One does not escape accountability.” James’ lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its 360 Savings accounts as having “one of the nation’s best savings rates” but then kept the interest rates “artificially low” while rates rose nationwide, according to the release. In addition, the lawsuit alleges that the bank created a “nearly identical” savings account called 360 Performance Savings that provided interest rates that were as much as 14 times higher, the release said. The suit alleges that Capital One “intentionally misled” its 360 Savings customers about the existence of the newer product to avoid paying them additional interest, per the release. “Capital One assured high returns with no catches, then pulled the rug out from under their customers and hoped nobody would notice,” James said in the release. “Big banks are not allowed to cheat their customers with false advertising and misleading promises.” Reached by PYMNTS, a Capital One spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the bank “strongly” disagrees with the attorney general’s claims and will “vigorously defend” itself in court. “Capital One is proud of its unique and industry-leading 360 suite of banking products, all of which offer great rates and carry no fees and no minimums,” the statement said. “Our flagship 360 Performance Savings product was marketed widely, including on national television, and has always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions,” the statement said. The CFPB filed its lawsuit against Capital One Jan. 14, with Rohit Chopra, who was the agency’s director at the time, saying in a press release: “The CFPB is suing Capital One for cheating families out of billions of dollars on their savings accounts.” The agency dropped the lawsuit Feb. 27, about four weeks after Chopra was fired as CFPB director by President Donald Trump.

Democratic lawmakers want the Federal Reserve to reconsider its approval of Capital One’s purchase of Discover. In a letter to the central bank Friday (May 2), Rep. Maxine Waters of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued that the decision to “rubber stamp” the merger would harm consumers and small businesses. “Merchants would have no choice but to accept the terms dictated by Capital One’s network, since they need to access the customers of the largest credit card issuer in the country,” the letter says. “The market power created by combining Capital One’s card base with Discover’s network explains why Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank described the acquisition of the network as a ‘holy grail.’” Warren and Waters are the top Democrats on the, respectively speaking, Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and House Financial Services Committee. The lawmakers also contend that the Federal Reserve failed to consider several recent developments, such as the economic impact of White House tariffs, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s involvement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), new data on credit card stress, and efforts by the Republicans to shutter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). They wrote that the Fed was “creating the largest credit card issuer in the country at the very moment the Trump administration is attempting to shut down the only agency with legal authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce federal consumer financial laws against the combined entity.” Capital One announced plans for the $35.3 billion merger last year. The Fed approved the deal last month, while the U.S. Department of Justice — after initially concluding that the merger would harm competition — has decided to let the purchase go forward. The deal is expected to become final on May 18. Discussing the merger during Capital One’s most recent earnings call, Fairbank said the combined entity will create a “leading consumer banking and payments platform.” Later in the call, the CEO noted that “Discover brings us a growth platform both on the network side and with respect to their card franchise that allows us to preserve the best of what they do and leverage a lot of Capital One’s capabilities.” In discussing the acquisition, Fairbank spotlighted what he said would be “unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands and a customer franchise of over 100 million customers that spans the marketplace … combining proven and complementary banking and credit card businesses with a global payments network.” The post Democrats Ask Fed to Rethink Approval of Capital One-Discover Merger appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

During a conference call with […] The post Discover Charge-Offs Improve and Debit Volumes Grow as Consumers Are ‘Stable’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Discover Financial Services posted first-quarter earnings results Thursday (April 24) that showed improving credit metrics, increased debit spending and higher deposits, ahead of its pending acquisition by Capital One. An earnings presentation showed that increased debit spending helped drive PULSE network volumes up 3% in the period, to $81.3 billion. During a conference call with analysts, which included no Q&A and no guidance due to the merger, Interim CEO Michael Shepherd said the tie-up with Capital One “will increase competition in payment networks, offer a wider range of products to our customers [and] increase the resources devoted to innovation and security.” The comments echoed sentiments from Capital One earlier this week. CEO Richard Fairbank said that upon closing next month, the deal will forge a “leading consumer banking and payments platform” that will come as “Discover brings us a growth platform both on the network side and with respect to their card franchise that allows us to preserve the best of what they do and leverage a lot of Capital One’s capabilities.” Discover shares were up 4.9% Thursday. Stable Consumers Shepherd took note of the “good credit performance” and said on the call that “Discover customer behavior was stable, evidenced by spend, payment and credit trends.” Within the card segment, the 30+ day delinquency rate was down by 0.18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, according to the presentation. The same credit metric was 0.17% better than the first quarter of 2024. “Consequently, our acquisition and underwriting strategies did not change materially during the quarter,” Shepherd said during the call. “In light of increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are closely monitoring economic developments and consumer health.” Chief Financial Officer John Greene said on the call that, alongside the credit performance, Discover’s provision expense — where reserves are taken to cover anticipated loan losses — declined by $253 million. Like other firms, Discover’s card receivables were relatively stable, down quarter on quarter as payment rates were up. The ending loan balances in the card business were $99 billion, off from $102.8 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, and down from $99.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024, per the presentation. “Discover card sales were down 2% compared to the prior year,” Greene said. The sales volume in the most recent quarter was $49.3 billion, according to the presentation. “The decline in card sales was from past credit tightening actions,” Greene said during the call. “Personal loan balances were flat. Although demand remains robust, our conservative underwriting posture and increased competition has slowed the pace of new originations.” The company’s personal loans on the books were at $10.1 billion, with net charge-offs at 4.21%, down three basis points from the end of last year, and up 0.19% from the year-ago period, per the presentation. Loan charge-offs were within expectations. Average consumer deposits were up 6% year over year and 1% sequentially, the presentation showed. “We grew direct-to-consumer deposit balance by $2 billion in the quarter while reducing average deposit rates by 22 basis points,” Greene said during the call. “Direct-to-consumer deposits now account for 74% of total funding.” The slowdown in Discover card sales led to $51 billion in payments volumes, according to the presentation. The Diners Club segment demonstrated robust growth, as volumes were $12 billion, up 18% year over year. Diners Club growth was driven in India and Israel.

With less than one month to go before its acquisition of Discover Financial Services, Capital One is on track to deliver synergies and forge an expanded consumer card and digital banking footprint in what the latter’s CEO, Richard Fairbank, said will create “something really special.” The combined entity, Fairbank said, will create a “leading consumer banking and payments platform” that he said toward the end of the call comes as “Discover brings us a growth platform both on the network side and with respect to their card franchise that allows us to preserve the best of what they do and leverage a lot of Capital One’s capabilities.” In discussing the acquisition, Fairbank highlighted what he said would be “unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a customer franchise of over 100 million customers that spans the marketplace … combining proven and complementary banking and credit card businesses with a global payments network. It leverages Capital One’s technology transformation and digital capabilities across a significantly larger customer franchise.” Looking ahead, and in the wake of the Discover deal, Fairbank said that “We’re trying to build a bank with leaner economics that comes from not having branches all over the place, and also to be very, very modern in its technology and its digital experiences. “In terms of the customer base that we attract to self-select a more digitally first kind of experience. … The benefit of the Discover acquisition relative to that … is that the benefit of vertical integration with the network allows our thin margin business to strengthen its margins and allows us to lean in harder and invest even more in building, organically, this national bank, which has never really been done before,” Fairbank said. “But that’s the key way that the Discover acquisition is going to help turbocharge our national bank.” Increased Spending, Improving Metrics Earnings materials from Capital One, detailing its results for the first quarter, showed that the firm released $458 million in reserves tied to its domestic card business. That action, as CFO Andrew Young said, was “driven by continued favorable credit performance in the quarter, partially offset by higher consideration to our downside economic scenario and increased qualitative factors to account for heightened uncertainty.” Management noted on the call that the macro environment may be volatile, but consumers continue to spend on their cards. Purchase volume growth in the latest period was up 5% to nearly $158 billion. Loans in the card business were up 4% year over year to $6.4 billion. Though the headline charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.2%, up 0.25% year over year, excluding the impact of the Walmart loss sharing agreement that ratio was 5.8%, which was actually a 0.17% improvement. “Our delinquencies have been improving steadily for several quarters on a seasonally adjusted basis. The 30-plus delinquency rate at the end of the first quarter was down 4.25%, down 23 basis points from the prior year,” Fairbank said, and he added that “We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and build an enduring franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace.” Within the consumer banking business, ending loan balances were up 5%, and deposits were up 8% at the end of the period. Automobile loans showed improvement in delinquency rates and charge-off ratios. Consumers Still Strong Asked by analysts about the state of the consumer, Fairbank said, “The U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the economy. That’s true for almost any metric that we look at. … Payment rates are improving on a year-over-year basis. Now, of course, the circumstances of individual consumers and households will vary, as they always do, and what we look at often with national metrics is averages. And as we’ve discussed before, some pockets of consumers are feeling pressure from the cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates. “We’re still seeing delayed charge-off effects from the pandemic, although our improving delinquencies suggest that this effect may be moderating. But on the whole, I’d say the U.S. consumer is in good shape,” said. “While the average customer is doing well, some customers at the margin are likely feeling stress from inflation and elevated interest rates.” Spending has in fact shown an uptick subsequent to the end of the quarter and into April, said Fairbank, where the firm has “seen a recent increase in retail spending, particularly electronics in the past few weeks. Maybe that’s a pulling forward of purchases in light of the tariffs. We’ll have to see over time.” The post Capital One CEO Says Discover Acquisition Will Build ‘Something Really Special’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The pending merger between Capital One and Discover Financial services received approval from several regulators Friday, bringing the $35 billion tie-up closer to completion. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency signed off on the deal, which was first announced in February 2024. The Federal Reserve Board said it entered into a consent order with Discover and assessed a fine of $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023. Discover has since terminated these practices and is repaying those fees to affected customers, according to the Federal Reserve. The board’s action is being taken in coordination with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. It said Capital One has committed that it will comply with the Board’s action against Discover of Riverwoods, Illinois, including remediation requirement, as a condition of approval. The OCC said its approval reflects its “careful analysis of the effect of the merger on communities, the banking industry, and the U.S. financial system.” Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, said it expects to complete the acquisition on May 18 now that it’s received all required regulatory approvals. Shareholders of both companies approved the deal i n February. The deal joins two of the largest credit card companies that aren’t banks first, like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, with the notable exception of American Express. It also brings together two companies whose customers are largely similar: often Americans who are looking for cash back or modest travel rewards, compared to the premium credit cards dominated by AmEx, Citi and Chase. It also will give Discover’s payment network a major credit card partner in a way that could make the payment network a major competitor once again. The U.S. credit card industry is dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly with AmEx being a distant third place and Discover an even more distant fourth place.",

Capital One and Discover Financial Services said Friday (April 18) that they have received all required regulatory approvals to complete Capital One’s proposed acquisition of Discover. With approvals announced Friday by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the companies now expect the transaction to close May 18, subject to customary closing conditions, they said in a Friday press release. “This is an exciting moment for Capital One and Discover,” Capital One founder, Chairman and CEO Richard Fairbank said in the release. “We understand the critical importance of a strong and competitive banking system to our customers and our economy, and we appreciate the thoughtful and diligent engagement of our regulators as they thoroughly reviewed this deal over the past 14 months.” Discover Interim CEO and President Michael Shepherd said in the release: “This combination of our two great companies will increase competition in payment networks, offer a wide range of products to our customers, increase our resources devoted to innovation and security, and bring meaningful community benefits.” Capital One announced the proposed acquisition in February 2024, saying the all-stock transaction, valued at $35.3 billion, will create a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. In July, facing some criticism from community groups that feared the planned takeover would reduce services and increase costs for Americans, Capital One said that a combination of Capital One and Discover would provide more benefits to underserved communities than the companies would offer separately. The Federal Reserve Board announced its approval of the proposed merger in a Friday press release, saying: “The Board evaluated the application under the statutory factors it is required to consider, including the financial and managerial resources of the companies, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the combined organization, and the competitive and financial stability impacts of the proposal.” The OCC said in a Friday press release announcing its conditional approval of the deal that it made its decision after analyzing the effect of the merger on communities, the banking industry and the U.S. financial system. The regulator said its approval is conditioned upon approved plans to address and remediate any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover. “The OCC is committed to a regulatory framework that expands access to financial services for consumers, businesses and communities,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said in the release. These announcements came on the same day that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board said they fined Discover Financial Services and two of its subsidiaries, alleging that they misclassified consumer credit cards as commercial, thereby requiring merchants to pay higher interchange fees.

Capital One Software introduced a tokenization solution to help businesses address data security challenges. Capital One Databolt is designed to let companies protect sensitive data at scale without sacrificing performance or speed, according to a Thursday (April 17) press release. “In an era marked by increasing data breaches, complex data privacy requirements, and the adoption of generative AI, the need for robust data protection has never been greater,” Capital One Software President Ravi Raghu said in the release. “Traditional data security methods often fall short with limited scalability and added complexity. Tokenization [provides] next-level security as companies navigate a growing need to protect their data and prepare for an AI-first world.” Databolt replaces sensitive data with secure tokens, reducing the risk that sensitive data is exposed during a breach, the release said. At the same time, Databolt preserves the underlying data format so that companies can still run applications, manage third-party data sharing and safely adopt generative artificial intelligence. “At Capital One, we recognized the power of tokenization early on and built our own solution to meet the needs of a cloud-first enterprise at scale,” Raghu said in the release. “Today, we run more than 100 billion tokenization operations a month across hundreds of applications.” The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Tokenization at Scale: Why More Retailers are Investing in the Future of Cybersecurity” examined the growing popularity of network tokens and payment tokens among businesses. Nearly 80% of small- to medium-sized merchants surveyed said they enabled one of the two types of tokens, with adoption reaching near-universal levels among higher-revenue merchants. Meanwhile, the PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Tokenization Innovation Report: The Future of Security and Personalization” found that network tokens offered by major credit card networks are poised for even more growth. For example, 77% of merchants not currently offering network tokens have plans to introduce them. Beyond that, 92% of payment service providers (PSPs) that already enable the technology plan to invest in further capability. Some of the key areas that merchants PSPs want to upgrade include digital wallet card payments, card-on-file payments and recurring payments.

The Justice Department reportedly told financial regulators that it didn’t have sufficient evidence to block the proposed merger between Capital One and Discover. This decision would allow the two banking regulators that must approve the deal — the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — to approve the transaction, Bloomberg reported Thursday (April 3). The Justice Department told the regulators of its decision in a confidential memo, the report said, citing unnamed sources. The Justice Department did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Staff at the Justice Department were divided about whether the merger should be challenged, and the new antitrust division chief, Gail Slater, made the decision that there was not enough evidence to do so, according to the report. Earlier, under the Biden administration, antitrust officials at the Justice Department had said they had some concerns that the deal could harm competition, per the report. Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department looked at not only the competitive factors of the deal, which is what it normally focuses on in bank mergers, but also how the deal might affect different customer segments, fees, interest rates, bank locations, product variety, network effects, interoperability and customer service, the report said. Capital One announced its planned acquisition of Discover in February 2024, saying the deal would create a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. “Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies,” Richard Fairbank, founder, chairman and CEO of Capital One, said at the time in a press release. The deal took a step toward completion in December when it received approval from the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. It took another step forward in February, when the two companies said that more than 99% of their shareholders had voted to approve the merger. When announcing the votes, Capital One said it expected the transaction to close early this year, subject to approval by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

The Justice Department (DOJ) is reportedly closer to permitting Capital One’s purchase of Discover. That’s according to a report Monday (March 31) by the Capital Forum, citing sources familiar with the matter. Those sources said the DOJ has refocused its review of the $35.3 billion deal on how it would hurt consumers with no credit history. The report said the DOJ had concluded it would not have a strong enough case in court to bar the merger based on concerns about the subprime sector. However, the department is divided on whether it could even bring a case involving no-credit-history borrowers to court, and could just allow the deal to close, the report added. Earlier in March, the news outlet had reported that the DOJ had determined that the deal would be anticompetitive. Capital One announced its planned acquisition of Discover in February of last year, saying the deal would create a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. “Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies,” Richard Fairbank, founder, chairman and CEO of Capital One, said in a news release at the time. In February, Capital One and Discover said that more than 99% of the stockholders for both companies had voted to OK the merger. Capital One has said it expects to close the transaction in the earlier part of this year, pending approval by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other closing conditions. The deal is also facing potential pushback on the state level. For example, New York Attorney General Letitia James said last year that her office was investigating the merger. James wrote in a court filing that the deal would have “significant impact” on New Yorkers, as the two companies would have a dominant 30% market share among subprime consumers. The potential merger is happening as consumers turn to credit as a way to stay on top of emergency expenditures, according to “Managing Unplanned Expenses: How The Pay Later Economy Fits Consumer Needs,” a PYMNTS Intelligence and Splitit collaboration. “Naturally, major unexpected expenses fall outside normal budgets, making it difficult for consumers to cover them,” PYMNTS wrote earlier this week. “For impulse and emergency purchases alike, shoppers are more likely to pay with credit than cash. In fact, our latest research shows that access to credit heavily impacts a shopper’s ability to manage unplanned expenses and remain financially flexible, especially in the face of emergencies.” The post DOJ Reportedly Closer to Approving Capital One/Discover Merger appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

But AI […] The post A Matter of Trust: How AI Is Reshaping Risk Assessment appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Financial services institutions have long relied on machine learning for risk management, but the threat landscape has grown exponentially in the age of generative artificial intelligence (AI), according to executives from Capital One, Visa and Alloy. Fraudsters now have access to AI tools, including synthetic identity generation and real-time phishing attacks, they said. But AI is also arming companies to supercharge their defensive capabilities, since trust and security are the foundation of financial transactions. “Trust is the very foundation of commerce,” said Rajat Taneja, president of technology at Visa. “When two unknown parties are transacting, they have to trust that the transaction will occur correctly, the money will be transferred properly, any dispute will be managed, and there’s someone handling fraud and scams.” Taneja said the first use case for AI in financial services was actually in risk management, and it remains a “critical tool to combat fraud, scams and enumeration attacks.” (Enumeration attacks are those that test different credentials such as passwords and usernames to gain unauthorized access.) The challenge is that criminals now also can use AI to attack. “We have ChatGPT, they have ‘FraudGPT,’” Taneja said. “It’s a constant battle.” FraudGPT is like the evil twin of ChatGPT: It is a malicious generative AI tool designed specifically for cybercriminal activities like creating phishing emails, undetectable malware and developing hacking tools. Subscription fees start at $200 per month and goes up to $1,700 per year. Visa, which processes more than $16 trillion annually, has used AI for fraud detection since 1992, according to Taneja. The latest advancements in GenAI let Visa develop models that detect fraud faster and more effectively. Shape-Shifting Adversary Prem Natarajan, chief scientist and head of enterprise AI at Capital One, likened AI-powered fraud to organisms with fast development cycles. Unlike traditional fraud techniques, modern AI-driven scams can adapt in real time. This ability to shift allows cybercriminals to continuously tweak their approaches based on what works. “It’s the first time we have a shape-shifter, in that, as it’s interacting with you, it can adapt itself,” he said during a panel discussion at the HumanX conference last week. Laura Spiekerman, co-founder of identity risk management company Alloy, emphasized that while deep fakes and identity fraud dominate headlines, a more worrisome trend is the speed at which AI allows fraudsters to operate. “We’ve seen synthetic fraud for six, seven, eight years now,” she said, explaining that this is when criminals build credible identities over time using half real credentials and half fake — and then cash out in large sums fraudulently. “What we’re seeing AI do is actually speed that up,” Spiekerman said. A key question in the discussion was when AI will be trusted enough to operate without human oversight. Natarajan said humans will always be involved, not just as reviewers but as end customers. “So the real question is how can we get signals from the end customer that we’re building trust with them with the AI we’re serving them?” Natarajan cited Capital One’s Chat Concierge, a multiagent conversational AI system designed for both car buyers and dealers. It not only provides information but also takes action on customer requests. Chat Concierge has been trained on Capital One data. “There is a human in the loop to make sure it doesn’t go awry,” Natarajan said. “We always use that as a guardrail.” Another use case is in call centers. Capital One is using AI to help its customer service representatives. “The moment when the agent picks up the call and starts talking with you is actually a high moment of impatience for the customer and a high-stress moment for the agent,” Natarajan said. With AI, Capital One can “simplify the agent’s experience in that moment and make it that much less stressful, transfer the burden from them to the system,” Natarajan added. AI and Compliance Taneja said Visa, which operates in 200 countries and processes 300 billion transactions annually, is investing in AI-driven compliance frameworks. “Compliance is a huge foundation for us,” Taneja said. “Compliance, both in the letter and spirit [of the law], is fundamental to the DNA of a platform like ours. And you have to do it in the spirit of making sure that your data complies with privacy, security [regulations] and ensuring every rule of every country you operate in is fully adhered to.” Spiekerman noted that financial institutions across the board, whether big or small, tend to react to fraud by shutting down operations rather than adapting their AI-driven fraud detection models. “When these financial institutions get hit with fraud, their answer is ‘shut it down,’” Spiekerman said. Instead, they should use AI to modify their response and selectively let some customers through. Looking ahead, Natarajan said AI will move from enabling “interactions to actions.” The future of AI in finance is one in which it can predict what actions to take, do those actions and complete them, he explained. At Visa, Taneja was excited about the idea of “agentic commerce,” where an AI agent does some aspects of the shopping process such as doing research, price matching, checking out warranties and finding goods the human user might like to buy. “The agentic commerce piece is very exciting,” Taneja said. “You get goosebumps thinking about what is coming next.” The post A Matter of Trust: How AI Is Reshaping Risk Assessment appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The Department of Justice has reportedly found that Capital One’s planned acquisition of Discover would be anticompetitive. “DOJ staff has determined that Capital One’s proposed $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial would harm competition in the subprime sector, sources familiar with the matter said,” The Capitol Forum said in a Monday (March 17) post on LinkedIn. The Department of Justice did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The department’s finding will be included in a draft report on the proposed combination that it is preparing to give to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Seeking Alpha reported Monday, citing a paywalled article by The Capitol Forum. Capital One and Discover said in a Feb. 18 press release that over 99% of the stockholders of both companies voted to approve the acquisition and that Capital One expected the transaction to close early this year, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Delaware State Bank Commission approved the proposed acquisition in December. Capital One announced its planned acquisition of Discover in February 2024, saying the all-stock transaction, valued at $35.3 billion, will create a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. “Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies,” Richard Fairbank, founder, chairman and CEO of Capital One, said at the time in a press release. It was reported in October that New York Attorney General Letitia James was investigating the proposed acquisition and asked a court for permission to issue subpoenas to Capital One, saying the bank had declined to voluntarily waive federal confidentiality protections. While the U.S. Justice Department was already reviewing the proposed deal, James said in a court filing that the deal would have “significant impact” on consumers in New York because the two companies would have a dominant 30% market share among subprime consumers.

Are the days of credit card users boosting the U.S. economy at an end? Share prices for four of the biggest credit card lenders — American Express, Discover, Capital One and Synchrony — are down an average of about 12% for the year, compared to a 4.5% drop in the overall S&P 500, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday (March 11). Americans’ inflation-adjusted debt has stretched beyond pre-pandemic levels, with the average household’s credit card debt surpassing $10,000 during the closing quarter of 2024. It’s the first time that figure has been reached since 2009, and it’s concerning investors, the report said. There are also concerns about rising delinquency rates, especially among high-income consumers. Between January 2023 and January 2025, late debt payments from people earning at least $150,000 per year more than doubled, according to the report. While those late payments account for a fraction of all outstanding balances, the increase outpaces upticks in late payments among middle- and low-income consumers, the report said. “We’re seeing heightened credit stress among high-income consumers,” VantageScore Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Economist Rikard Bandebo said, per the report, adding that the stresses are more pronounced for consumers without nest eggs. February data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that 11.35% of credit cards are more than 90 days overdue, a 17% jump from the previous year. These delinquency levels haven’t been seen since the fourth quarter of 2011. Meanwhile, the New York Fed warned of a decline in sentiment among consumers about their financial futures, following the release of the bank’s monthly consumer expectations survey. “Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago were mostly unchanged, but year-ahead expectations about households’ financial situations deteriorated considerably,” the Fed said this week. “The share of households expecting a worse financial situation in one year from now rose to 27.4%, the highest level since November 2023.” The post Consumer Credit Concerns Mount as Late Payments Climb appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The lawsuit alleges it was \"de-banked\" because of President Donald Trump's political views.The suit was filed as Capital One is seeking federal regulatory approval for its Discover merger.President Donald Trump's family business empire has sued Capital One over what it described in court papers as the bank's \"reckless\" decision to terminate hundreds of its accounts after the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.The Trump Organization alleges in the lawsuit, filed Friday in Florida's Miami-Dade Circuit Court, that Capital One \"de-banked\" the company's accounts that held millions of dollars because of Trump's political views.\"Plaintiffs have reason to believe that Capital One's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,\" the lawsuit says.The lawsuit puts Capital One in a somewhat precarious position with the Trump administration. The bank still must obtain approval from federal bank regulators for its proposed $35 billion merger with Discover Financial Services.Trump, during his 2024 presidential campaign, repeatedly pledged revenge against his political rivals and critics if re-elected.Adam Levitin, a Georgetown Law professor who specializes in financial regulation, said in a blog post that Capital One should be able to \"easily\" get the case dismissed, but that it may not matter \"because the Trump Organization has them over a barrel.\"\"If Capital One doesn't pay up, the implicit threat is that the Trump administration will move to block the Capital One-Discover merger and generally make life unpleasant for Capital One,\" Levitin wrote in the post on CreditSlips.org.\"The real question here is whether Capital One is going to fight this, and, if so, how hard,\" Levitin continued in the post. \"Capital One should win this one if it litigates, but it will likely come at the cost of their merger with Discover. Paying a few million to the Trump Organization in a settlement is a very low cost for greasing the wheels for the merger.\"Levitin didn't return a request for comment from Business Insider.The Trump Organization's lawsuit against Capital One alleges the debanking of the company's accounts due to President Donald Trump's political views.Alex Wong/Getty ImagesFinancial consultant and author Todd Baker called the lawsuit \"an example of what might be called the 'protection racket' approach to government.\"Less than two weeks ago, the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau dropped a lawsuit accusing Capital One of cheating customers out of $2 billion in interest payments, Baker noted.The lawsuit and pending Discovery deal now \"sends a clear message: 'It sure would be a shame if something happened to your little merger,\" said Baker, who teaches at Columbia University's law and business schools.\"I did you a favor; now do me a favor, and I'll do you another favor,\" he added. \"By any definition other than the Supreme Court's, this is quid pro quo corruption.\"The White House did not comment for this story. The Trump Organization and Capital One did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Monday.George Hay, a professor at Cornell Law School and former chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, told BI that most antitrust observers \"probably believe that the proposed merger was highly pro-competitive, making Discover into a much more serious competitor.\"Hay said that the DOJ \"would be taking a big risk\" if it moved to sue to block Capital One's acquisition of Discover \"when the chances of winning are so small and it would be hard to get the career staff to get on board with such a case.\"But getting the merger approved by federal regulators may be another story, the antitrust-law expert said.\"A banking authority may simply be able to say no\" without having to prove the case in court, said Hay.The Trump Organization — which is helmed by Trump's son, Eric Trump, who is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit — said in a statement last week that it's seeking \"to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods.\"\"This lawsuit, and those that follow, are necessary steps to protect the integrity of American business practices and to ensure that no company or individual is unfairly targeted for their beliefs, affiliations, or business activities,\" the Trump Organization said. \"We will not stand by while big banks misuse their power to stifle businesses and harm innocent Americans.\"The lawsuit accuses Capital One of 'unlawful, deceptive, and reckless conduct'The lawsuit against Capital One says that Trump's real estate and golf resort company and its affiliated entities have transacted \"tens of millions of dollars\" through the bank for decades.In March of 2021, Capital One \"without warning or provocation\" notified the plaintiffs that more than 300 of their accounts would be terminated, according to the lawsuit and the Trump Organization's statement.\"In essence, Capital One 'de-banked' Plaintiffs' Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,\" says the lawsuit, which accuses the bank of \"unlawful, deceptive, and reckless conduct.\"The lawsuit, which seeks damages, alleges violations of several states' consumer protection and fraud laws.Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution think-tank told BI that when he researches America's debanking problem, Eric Trump and the Trump Organization are hardly the victims he has in mind.\"People are kicked out of the banking system all the time,\" he said. \"The No. 1 reason is they don't have enough money because the bank account fees are too damn expensive.\"Klein, a senior fellow and Miriam K. Carliner Chair at Brookings, also said that the timing of the lawsuit was notable.\"It's quite interesting timing that right before the biggest bank merger that's currently pending, this allegation is made about activity that occurred years ago. When Trump himself was talking about debanking at Davos he didn't mention this,\" Klein added. \"One thinks he might have mentioned it then.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Capital One and Wells Fargo are among 10 financial institutions rated “outstanding” in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) latest list of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) performance evaluations. Another 16 financial institutions were rated “satisfactory,” the regulator said in a Monday (March 3) press release. None of the financial institutions whose CRA performance evaluations became public in February were rated “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.” “Under the CRA, the OCC assesses an institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution,” the release said. The 10 banks rated “outstanding” include McLean, Virginia-based Capital One, National Association; Collinsville, Illinois-based Collinsville Building and Loan Association; Toledo, Illinois-based First Neighbor Bank, National Association; Dunkirk, New York-based Lake Shore Savings Bank; Lyons, Kansas-based Lyons Federal Bank; Bronx, New York-based Ponce Bank; Coalgate, Oklahoma-based Shamrock Bank, National Association; Granger, Texas-based The Granger National Bank; Enid, Oklahoma-based The Security National Bank of Enid; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. Capital One was rated outstanding in each of the three major factors that support the rating: the lending test, the investment test and the service test, according to the public disclosure of its CRA performance evaluation. The evaluation highlighted that Capital One offered flexible secured consumer credit card products that provided access to credit to individuals who did not meet the bank’s traditional underwriting guidelines, formalized its volunteer services under a pro bono volunteer program that matches bank employees’ skills with needs identified by nonprofit organizations, and made an adequate percentage of its loans in its assessment areas. Wells Fargo, too, was rated outstanding in each of the three major factors, per the public disclosure of the bank’s CRA performance evaluation. The evaluation said Wells Fargo used flexible lending programs to enhance its lending performance in multiple assessment areas, offered innovative or complex CD investment initiatives, and provided innovative retail service programs. The OCC determines the CRA ratings based on performance tests and standards outlined in the CRA rule and based on information about the institution and the community it serves, according to a questions and answers page about the program. The CRA rules were enacted in 1977 to combat discriminatory lending practices in minority neighborhoods, PYMNTS reported in October 2023. The OCC list includes national banks, federal savings associations and insured federal branches of foreign banks that have received CRA ratings, according to the release. The Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) enforce the CRA among other types of banks, PYMNTS reported in February.
