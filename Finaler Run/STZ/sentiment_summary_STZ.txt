Date: 2025-06-03 23:08:52

Title: Stock Movers: Dollar General, Constellation, Broadcom (Podcast)
Date: 2025-06-03 21:16:21
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news is a podcast mentioning STZ alongside other companies.

Title: Ten nuclear stocks to consider as Meta and Constellation ink long-term contract
Date: 2025-06-03 18:20:43
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news mentions "Constellation" (potentially referring to Constellation Energy) alongside Meta in a nuclear energy contract.

Title: Meta signs 20-year PPA with Constellation for entire output of Illinois nuclear power plant
Date: 2025-06-03 18:00:03
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While a PPA agreement is generally positive for Constellation (and thus STZ through its ownership), the news is unlikely to significantly impact STZ's stock price within the next 60 minutes. The connection is indirect (Meta -> Clean Energy Center -> Constellation -> STZ), and the 30MW expansion's financial impact is unlikely to be material enough to trigger significant short-term trading activity. The news lacks the immediate impact needed for a rapid, algorithmically exploitable price movement.

Date: 2025-06-03 13:15:02
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news concerns Constellation Energy Corp. (not STZ), making it irrelevant to STZ's immediate performance. While the article does mention a significant 20-year deal, it does not directly impact STZ's revenue, costs, or operations, leading to a negligible surprise factor for STZ traders.

Date: 2025-05-16 14:14:45
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Berkshire Hathaway doubling its stake represents a significant increase in confidence from a highly respected investor.

Title: BI Weekend: Delta, Constellation Brands Earnings (Podcast)
Date: 2025-04-11 20:55:59
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news title mentions Constellation Brands earnings in a podcast.

Date: 2025-04-11 11:39:30
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news outlines a long-term target, FY28, which is well outside of the 60-minute trading window.

Date: 2025-04-10 18:44:49
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news directly links a major political issue (immigration policy) to a significant portion of STZ's beer sales (50% from Hispanic consumers).

Date: 2025-04-10 18:26:39
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news directly affects STZ's revenue through decreased demand for key brands (Modelo, Corona).

Title: Stock Movers: Carnival, CarMax, Constellation (Podcast)
Date: 2025-04-10 17:20:37
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news title mentions STZ along with other companies, indicating it's likely a general market commentary or overview.

Title: Modelo owner Constellation Brands outlook disappoints as tariffs weigh on forecast
Date: 2025-04-09 23:20:48
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While Constellation Brands beat quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, the disappointing outlook due to tariffs is likely to trigger immediate negative sentiment. The market often reacts more strongly to forward-looking guidance than past performance, making this tariff-related headwind a significant negative catalyst in the short term. The expectation of reduced future profitability will likely outweigh the positive earnings beat in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Constellation Brands issues soft outlook, divests mainstream wine business
Date: 2025-04-09 23:18:36
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The "soft outlook" is a negative catalyst as it directly impacts STZ's projected revenue and profitability. The divestiture, while potentially positive long-term, adds uncertainty in the immediate term as the market absorbs the news and analyzes the financial implications of the sale. Short-term traders will likely react negatively to the lowered expectations within the next 60 minutes, outweighing any perceived benefit from the divestiture announcement.
```

Title: Constellation Brands Non-GAAP EPS of $2.63 beats by $0.36, revenue of $2.16B beats by $40M; issues outlook
Date: 2025-04-09 23:17:08
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news reports that STZ beat earnings expectations by $0.36 and revenue expectations by $40M. This is a significant positive surprise (Magnitude & Surprise), likely triggering immediate positive sentiment and buying pressure from short-term traders (Sentiment Trigger) due to the quantifiable outperformance (Quantifiable Data). Therefore, the stock price is likely to increase in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Earnings Snapshot: Constellation Brands tops FQ4 consensus, 2026 EPS guidance misses expectations
Date: 2025-04-09 23:12:02
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While the headline indicates FQ4 earnings topped consensus, the miss in 2026 EPS guidance outweighs this in the short term. The forward-looking guidance miss introduces immediate uncertainty and will likely trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders focused on future profitability, leading to a price decrease in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Corona Brewer Issues Downbeat Outlook Factoring in New Tariffs
Date: 2025-04-09 23:05:12

Title: Constellation defends planned Calpine acquisition as consumer groups object
Date: 2025-04-09 16:17:37
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news title indicates opposition to a planned acquisition. While the article content is missing, the headline "Constellation defends planned Calpine acquisition as consumer groups object" implies potential regulatory or consumer pushback, creating uncertainty. This uncertainty is likely to trigger a negative knee-jerk reaction from short-term traders within the 60-minute window, as it introduces a potential obstacle to the acquisition's completion.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Constellation Brands Q4 2025 Earnings Preview
Date: 2025-04-08 23:35:32
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: An earnings preview, by itself, does not provide quantifiable data or direct impact to STZ's financials within the next 60 minutes. While it sets the stage for a future earnings release, it lacks the immediate surprise or sentiment trigger needed for a significant price movement. The market reaction depends on the actual figures when released, not on pre-release anticipation.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Will Constellation Brands Earnings Lift Or Sink The Stock?
Date: 2025-04-08 17:59:06
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news is simply reporting analyst expectations.

Title: Fading Warren Buffett: Citi downgrades Constellation Brands
Date: 2025-03-20 22:47:08
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: A downgrade from a major institution like Citi, especially one citing "Fading Warren Buffett" (implying a negative outlook aligned with Buffett's actions), will likely trigger immediate negative sentiment.
