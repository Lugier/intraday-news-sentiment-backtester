Date: 2025-06-17 18:38:50
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news of the FDA launching national vouchers to cut drug review time is likely positive for BMY in the immediate term. Faster drug review times can potentially accelerate BMY's pipeline and bring products to market faster, which could be seen favorably by short-term traders.

Title: AbbVie fails in late-stage trial for Roche-partnered blood cancer therapy venetoclax | $RHHBY $RHHBF $ABBV $BMY
Date: 2025-06-16 16:10:42
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While the news doesn't directly involve BMY, it does involve a competitor, AbbVie ($ABBV), and a drug in the same therapeutic area (blood cancer). The failure of AbbVie's venetoclax trial is likely to put negative sentiment on other companies with similar drugs in development or on the market, creating a negative correlation.

Date: 2025-06-08 15:05:06

Date: 2025-06-02 12:45:13
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: A $11 billion deal with BioNTech represents a significant positive catalyst. The magnitude of the deal and the potential to compete with Merck's Keytruda should drive short-term positive sentiment and buying pressure as traders react to the news, especially in the first 60 minutes.
```

Title: Bristol-Myers to Pay BioNTech Up to $11.1 Billion in Cancer Deal
Date: 2025-06-02 12:45:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The $11.1 billion payment represents a significant cash outflow for BMY in the immediate term. While the potential long-term benefits of the licensed cancer drug may be positive, the large upfront cost and associated risks (drug failure, etc.) are likely to trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders within the next 60 minutes, outweighing any perceived potential. This high dollar amount will likely be perceived negatively.

Date: 2025-05-21 18:03:22
Sentiment: negative

Date: 2025-05-15 17:35:46
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news focuses on potential tariffs impacting the pharma industry in general, specifically mentioned is Bayer. While BMY is listed, the news does not directly or uniquely target BMY.

Date: 2025-05-10 12:53:21
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: A $700M settlement is a tangible financial cost to BMY.

Date: 2025-05-09 18:00:04
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the news mentions "Bristol Myers Squibb execs open up on AI," the description lacks specifics on the nature or magnitude of this development.

Date: 2025-05-07 22:51:34
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of Trump planning an Executive Order to further cut Medicare drug prices directly affects BMY's revenue since Medicare is a significant payer for its drugs.

Date: 2025-05-06 23:04:28
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While the $40B investment is a long-term positive, the immediate news includes 516 layoffs in New Jersey, which is likely to trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders.

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-05-06 20:37:54
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news of the Trump administration canceling a meeting with an FDA workers union has no direct impact on BMY's revenue, costs, operations, or market share in the next 60 minutes. While the FDA is relevant to BMY, this particular news event is not a known catalyst and the lack of detail and surprise factor suggest traders won't likely react significantly in the short term.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bristol Myers Promises $40 Billion US Investment Over Five Years
Date: 2025-05-05 22:32:09
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The $40 billion investment announcement is likely already factored into BMY's valuation as similar announcements have been made by competitors. While the RayzeBio acquisition is positive, the $4.1B is not large enough to significantly move the needle on BMY's short-term price given its market capitalization and ongoing M&A activity. Therefore, neither aspect offers enough surprise or immediate impact to cause a substantial directional movement within the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Insider trades: Tesla, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley among notable names this week | $PG $AXP $C $BMY $LUV
Date: 2025-05-03 17:03:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news mentions BMY as one of several companies with insider trading activity. This is unlikely to cause a significant price movement within 60 minutes because it is a general news item covering multiple companies and the inclusion of BMY is not specific enough to trigger immediate trading activity. The impact is likely minimal and would be hard to quantify without further detail on the specific trades.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Sandoz inks agreement with Shanghai Henlius for Bristol Yervoy biosimilar | $BMY $SDZNY
Date: 2025-04-29 17:43:17
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Sandoz, a competitor, securing an agreement for a biosimilar of Yervoy (a key BMY drug) is a direct negative catalyst.

Date: 2025-04-27 17:55:00
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The headline "Healthcare earnings sweep past Wall Street estimates" suggests positive earnings performance within the healthcare sector, including BMY.

Title: Why we're lowering our Bristol Myers price target despite an earnings beat, guidance raise
Date: 2025-04-24 19:26:27
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title highlights a price target *lowering* despite positive earnings and guidance. The description explicitly states "shares of Bristol Myers Squibb fell modestly" after the announcement. This combination of lowered price target and immediate negative price reaction suggests a negative sentiment trigger that will likely continue in the short-term, pushing the price down in the next 60 minutes.
```

Date: 2025-04-24 15:21:45
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title indicates that Eliquis is the only segment seeing growth, implying that other segments are not. While the performance of Eliquis is positive, the fact that it is the *only* segment showing growth could be interpreted negatively for the overall health of BMY's portfolio in the short term. Without further context on the size and relative importance of each segment, it's difficult to determine the net impact, resulting in a neutral classification.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-04-23 17:53:42
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: An earnings preview is unlikely to cause significant price movement in the immediate 60 minutes. While previews can generate some interest, they lack the definitive data (quantifiable data) to trigger a substantial reaction. This falls under "news already priced in or widely expected."
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bristol Myers Schizophrenia Drug Cobenfy Failed in Key Study
Date: 2025-04-22 22:48:55
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The failure of BMY's schizophrenia drug in a key study is a negative catalyst, directly impacting potential future revenue and dampening growth ambitions. The surprise of the failure, coupled with the potential impact on blockbuster drug status, will likely trigger immediate negative sentiment and selling pressure within the 60-minute window.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bristol Myers fails trial for Cobenfy as adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia | $BMY
Date: 2025-04-22 22:41:34
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The failure of a trial, especially in a disease area like schizophrenia, directly impacts BMY's pipeline and potential future revenue. This is a significant negative surprise, likely triggering immediate selling pressure as traders react to the news of a failed clinical program, outweighing any potential offsetting factors in the short term. Therefore, this will negatively impact BMY's price in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Zai Lab gets China's acceptance for label expansion of repotrectinib | $ZLAB $BMY
Date: 2025-04-21 15:33:27
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: Zai Lab's label expansion acceptance, while positive for ZLAB, only has an indirect link to BMY. The news doesn't directly affect BMY's financials or operations within the next 60 minutes. While there *might* be a small sympathy move, it is unlikely to be significant enough to justify a trade based solely on this news item.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-04-16 02:23:15
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news regarding Trump targeting Medicare price negotiations via executive order poses a direct threat to BMY's revenue streams, as Medicare is a significant payer for their drugs.

Date: 2025-04-14 22:51:31
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news title "Bristol Myers fails in late-stage trial of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treatment" indicates a direct negative impact on BMY's pipeline and future revenue potential, a known catalyst type.

Date: 2025-04-02 16:08:44
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news that BMY will trade ex-dividend on a specific date is a known event.

Date: 2025-04-01 21:43:52
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title "Big Pharma drops sharply ahead of Trumpâ€™s tariff announcement" suggests negative sentiment towards the pharmaceutical industry, including BMY.

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Senior leaders at HHS put on administrative leave amid staff cuts - report | $AMGN $GILD $JNJ $BMY $PFE
Date: 2025-04-01 17:45:37
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news describes administrative leave at HHS, not a specific action or decision directly impacting BMY's revenue, costs, or operations.

Date: 2025-03-28 14:59:51
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: A "positive opinion" from CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use) regarding Opdivo suggests a high likelihood of eventual approval in Europe for multiple solid tumors. This represents a potential expansion of Opdivo's market and thus increased revenue for BMY. The positive sentiment associated with regulatory approval news, especially for a key drug, typically causes a short-term price increase as traders anticipate future sales.

Date: 2025-03-18 20:22:38
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While 340B program impacts pharmaceutical companies, the news indicates continuity from one administration to the next. This suggests the potential impact on BMY has already been priced in. Consequently, a neutral stance seems appropriate given the lack of new information likely to drive short-term price movement.

Title: Bristol Myers Squibb gets EC nod for expanded use of Breyanzi | $BMY
Date: 2025-03-14 14:57:43
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The EC nod for expanded use of Breyanzi represents a direct positive impact on BMY's potential revenue stream as it widens the drug's market reach within Europe. FDA/EC approvals are known positive catalysts, and the positive nod creates a sentiment trigger for short-term traders. This specific EC approval isn't unexpected but still likely generates enough FOMO-driven buying pressure to impact the price within the next 60 minutes.
```

Title: FDA commissioner nominee Makary advances to full Senate vote | $AMGN $GILD $JNJ $GSK $BMY
Date: 2025-03-13 15:58:39
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news is about the FDA commissioner nominee advancing to a full Senate vote. While the FDA is important to BMY, this news is about the *nominee*, not an immediate FDA decision affecting BMY's drugs or pipeline. Therefore, no direct impact on BMY's revenue or costs within the next 60 minutes is expected, and the sentiment is NEUTRAL.
```

Title: BMS to Acquire Abecma Partner 2seventy bio for $286M
Date: 2025-03-11 17:44:27
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While the acquisition of 2seventy bio gives BMY full control of Abecma revenue, the market's initial reaction (BMY shares dipped 2%) indicates a negative sentiment. The analyst's note expressing "modest confidence in the near-term profit potential" and the caution about competition from Kite/Gilead's "anito-cel" are likely to fuel short-term selling pressure.
