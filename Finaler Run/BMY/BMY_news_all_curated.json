Recursion rethinks its pipeline, the FDA gives Abeona’s gene therapy a chance, and Bristol Myers Squibb execs open up on AI. The post COVID-19’s Origin Insights, Recursion Reverses Course, and AACR Stands Up for Cancer Research appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. The exact origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still something of a mystery, but scientists may be one step closer. This week, we discuss research that points to a possible explanation for how the virus reached Wuhan. Also in the episode, we dive into GEN’s coverage of the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), including how the community is navigating massive research budget cuts. Then we discuss a potential therapy for colorectal cancer using CRISPR-edited tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and a method for delivering protein therapies and gene editors using engineered vesicles. Lastly, in business news, Recursion rethinks its pipeline, the FDA gives Abeona’s gene therapy a chance, and Bristol Myers Squibb execs open up on artificial intelligence.

        "description": "Boerner’s investment pledge makes BMS the latest biopharma giant to join a growing parade of drug and diagnostics developers that have announced more than $200 billion in new and renovated facilities focused mostly on manufacturing, but also including some R&D and other operations. The post BMS Commits $40B over Five Years to U.S. R&D, Manufacturing appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Board Chair and CEO Christopher Boerner, PhD Bristol Myers Squibb, Board Chair of BMS and CEO Christopher Boerner, PhD, have committed the pharma giant to investing $40 billion over the next five years toward U.S. research and development (R&D), technology, and manufacturing efforts. “Through this investment plan, we will strengthen our presence across the country, ramp up radiopharmaceutical manufacturing, and invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning to help us significantly increase the pace of innovation,” Boerner stated in a commentary published in STAT News. Boerner did not detail the projects that BMS plans to invest in, specify which ones would be new construction or renovation, or offer a projected number of jobs to be created. Artificial intelligence (AI) investment has emerged as a BMS priority. Robert Plenge, MD, PhD, executive vice president, chief research officer, and head of research joining Greg Meyers, executive vice president and chief digital & technology officer, recently told GEN Edge the company’s approach to AI and successful applications. “For more than 160 years, the majority of Bristol Myers Squibb’s employees, R&D investments, and manufacturing infrastructure have been based in the United States. And we have no plans for that to change.” Boerner’s investment pledge makes BMS the latest biopharma giant to join a growing parade of drug and diagnostics developers that have announced more than $200 billion in new and renovated facilities. Primarily focused on manufacturing, some developers also work with R&D and other operations. The announcements have trickled out in recent months as President Donald Trump’s administration has pressed the industry to make more of its products in the U.S., in part by threatening to impose tariffs on pharma imports. “In anticipation of potential tariffs, we continue to execute mitigation efforts. We have a broad global manufacturing network where we’re looking for opportunities to optimize with tariffs in mind,” Boerner told analysts April 24 on the company’s first quarter earnings call, adding: “We already have a significant presence in the U.S. and we’re continuing to invest.” Domestic manufacturing order Yesterday, Trump stepped up Washington’s full-court press on biopharma to promote more domestic manufacturing, by signing an executive order executive order directing FDA Commissioner Martin Makary, MD, to: • Review existing regulations and guidance pertaining to domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing development. • Take steps to eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance. • Maximize the timeliness and predictability of agency review. • Streamline and accelerate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. “The FDA Commissioner’s review shall encompass all regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the United States,” according to Trump’s order. That order also directed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin to update regulations and guidance applying to U.S. inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials. Warning on pricing, tariffs Boerner warned against policies that would cut U.S. spending toward drug production, or set prices along the lines of European countries, which he asserted “has limited the availability of new medicines and significantly slowed their adoption.” Trump’s administration is reported to be considering adopting for Medicaid-paid drugs a “most-favored nation” (MFN) pricing approach, which bases the prices of U.S. treatments on the lowest prices paid in comparable countries. But the BMS CEO aligned with the president on a key policy priority, urging Congress to extend the series of tax cuts that Trump’s first administration enacted in 2017 through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, set to expire at the end of this year. “This presidential administration and some members of Congress have championed policies that will strengthen American innovation and competitiveness. Bolstering U.S. manufacturing enables greater control over highly complex supply chains and bring manufacturing closer to where the majority of R&D is taking place,” Boerner wrote. “Extending supportive tax policies from President Trump’s first term would further enhance U.S.-based research spending.” The largest of the biopharma commitments to U.S. manufacturing and R&D has been made by Johnson & Johnson, which has promised to invest $55 billion over four years. Other biopharma commitments have been made by Roche ($50 billion over five years), Eli Lilly ($27 billion, on top of $23 billion spent since 2020), Novartis ($23 billion over five years), AstraZeneca ($3.5 billion by the end of 2026), Amgen ($1 billion second manufacturing plant in Holly Springs, NC, $900 million expansion in New Albany, OH), and Thermo Fisher Scientific ($2 billion over four years). Merck & Co. has committed $9 billion, including a $1 billion biologics center of excellence in Wilmington, DE, that has broken ground and a $1 billion vaccine manufacturing facility that has opened in Durham, NC—in addition to $12 billion invested in U.S. manufacturing and R&D projects since 2018. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals last month joined with contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) giant Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies to announce a 10-year, $3 billion-plus manufacturing supply agreement designed to provide U.S.-based production of biologics. Layoffs in Lawrence Township Boerner disclosed BMS’ U.S. investment plans the same day New Jersey news outlets disclosed BMS’ planned elimination of 516 jobs in Lawrence Township, NJ, based on a series of Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notices made public by the state’s Department of Labor & Workforce Development. The 516 jobs will be eliminated in 14 groups starting Friday and running through March 27, 2026. The 516 jobs are among three rounds of job cuts at the facility totaling 806 positions set to be eliminated this year. BMS began eliminating the first set of 67 jobs April 24, to end December 11. A second round of 223 jobs will disappear between May 22 and August 1. The state listing of notices did not specify the types of jobs being eliminated or the nature of those jobs, or whether jobs would be cut at one or both of BMS’ campuses in Lawrence Township: • Lawrenceville—BMS now houses its R&D headquarters within a 276-acre campus on Route 206 consisting of 13 connected buildings totaling 1.5 million square feet. R&D researchers based their focus on discovering and developing therapies in oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular diseases, three of the company’s five R&D areas of focus (the others are hematology and neuroscience). • Princeton Pike—Employees from BMS’ commercial teams, their commercialization and late-stage development partners from its R&D and Global Manufacturing & Supply operations, as well as their enabling function support teams are based within a 650,000-square foot facility that opened in 2016. The New Jersey job cuts come at a time when BMS is carrying out two cost-cutting initiatives—an initial plan to eliminate $1.5 billion in expenses by the end of this year, plus a newer effort to slice $2 billion in company costs by the end of 2027, announced by the company on February 6 when it reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. BMS has blamed the cost-cutting initiatives on its need to recoup losses expected as some of its “blockbuster” drugs that have long generated more than $1 billion in sales lose patent exclusivity. Two such drugs will lose U.S. patent protection in 2028—cancer immunotherapy Opdivo® (nivolumab), which generated $9.304 billion in 2024 product revenues (up 3% from 2023); and Eliquis® (apixaban), a blood thinner that racked up $13.333 billion in 2024 (up 9% year over year).

        "description": "BMS says it is combining AI and machine learning with its researchers’ expertise in drug targets and mechanisms of action, to conceptualize, create, and evaluate the most promising molecules in its pipeline more effectively than ever, an approach the company sums up as, “predict first.” The post Predict First: BMS Executives Discuss Company’s AI Approach appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. While it is common to hear that drug developers are in the early stages of integrating artificial intelligence with their drug research, discovery, and development efforts, one Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) executive recently offered a more descriptive and no less accurate metaphor stretching back some 45 years. Greg Meyers, Bristol Myers Squibb executive vice president and chief digital & technology officer “The state of artificial intelligence and machine learning is similar to where we were with personal computers in 1980,” Greg Meyers, BMS’ executive vice president and chief digital & technology officer, recently stated on the company’s technologies webpage. “Technology and digital capabilities will transform our ways of working, from how we develop medicines, to how we improve the patient experience, to how we run our core business operations.” BMS says it is applying AI and machine learning, combining those with its researchers’ expertise in drug targets and mechanisms of action, to conceptualize, create, and evaluate the most promising molecules in its sizeable pipeline (50 compounds, 40+ disease areas) more effectively than ever, through an approach the company sums up as, “predict first.” The company’s interest in AI stretches to pre-COVID-19 days. In 2019, BMS joined with oncology data-focused Concert HealthAI (now ConcertAI) to apply AI and machine learning to accelerate clinical trials, enable robust protocol design, and generate insights for precision treatment and improved patient outcomes. That same year, BMS acquired Celgene for $74 billion, and in the process inherited a small molecule oncology collaboration with AI drug development pioneer Exscientia. BMS and Exscientia expanded the partnership to a potentially more than $1.3 billion alliance for developing not only cancer drugs but immunology and inflammation (I&I) treatments as well, led by a potentially first-in-class selective protein kinase C (PKC) theta inhibitor now in Phase I study for immunology indications. The drug is now being developed by Recursion, which combined with Exscientia in November. Also in 2024, BMS inked a collaboration with VantAI to apply its generative AI platform to design molecular glues as small molecule therapeutics. BMS agreed to pay VantAI up to $674 million tied to achieving discovery, development, clinical, regulatory, and sales milestones, plus tiered royalties. BMS also has an option to expand to additional therapeutic programs. Robert Plenge, MD, PhD, Bristol Myers Squibb executive vice president, chief research officer, and head of research “AI and machine learning tools aren’t changing what we do at Bristol Myers Squibb, which is discover, develop, and deliver transformational medicines to patients, but they are changing how we do it,” stated Robert Plenge, MD, PhD, executive vice president, chief research officer, and head of research. “These technologies are enabling our scientists to more deeply understand human biology and make more effective use of vast amounts of data. The advancements in predictive molecule invention seen to date have already been immense, informing key aspects of our research strategy as we look to improve the quality and speed of our investigational programs.” GEN Edge recently discussed BMS’ approach to AI, and successful applications, with Plenge and Meyers. (This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.) GEN Edge: What is BMS’s approach to research? And what is BMS’ research organization? Robert Plenge, MD, PhD: We like to lay out these five principles because this guides a lot of what we do, not just within research, but also research and development, and how we prioritize opportunities, both internal and external. We start with these five principles. And in some ways, you can think about it as a linear progression from the earliest stages of research all the way to commercialization, but the principles can be applied to any program at any stage in development. The first principle is how to think about targets, and we think very deeply about the human evidence and the human support for the targets, and we call this causal human biology. We often use genetics to find really good targets, but we can also think about longitudinal profiling, clinical pharmacology, and other things as well. The second principle is how to match a therapeutic modality to a molecular mechanism of action. That’s a bit of a mouthful, so we shorten that to matching modality to mechanism. And this is basically, how do you create a molecule which recapitulates human biology that has a desired effect on human physiology? Is it a small molecule? Is it a large molecule? Is it a nucleic acid? Is it something that is a living cell therapy? Is it something that engages the immune system? And the third principle, and this really begins a transition from research into development, how do you take those preclinical ideas and show that they are working in humans the way that you think and predict that they will work? We call that path to clinical proof of concept. And that’s really that moment in clinical development where you say, oh my goodness, we have a drug that we think is going to make a difference in patients, because you really see how the molecule acts. Once you begin to see that clinical proof of concept, then the fourth principle is to accelerate full development, accelerate clinical development, because you want to get that medicine through all stages of clinical development in as many indications as possible, so you can really get that medicine to as many patients as quickly as possible. Then finally, the fifth principle is how to maximize market access, and how to show that a medicine really is differentiating from anything else that’s out there, because that’s going to provide the greatest benefit to patients with the greatest need. Those are the five principles. We apply them in research, we apply them to therapeutic areas, we apply them in the context of any individual asset. Again, we can actually apply those same principles wherever they are, whatever stage they are in the R&D organization. GEN Edge: How does AI help BMS achieve some of these pillars of research? Greg Meyers: A lot of what Robert described really explains the complexity of biology. And if you think of physics and chemistry, we have pretty good physical models. It’s one of the reasons why I could launch a projectile in the air at 12 degrees at a certain velocity so that you know exactly where it’s going to land. Biology doesn’t work that way. If you think about even blood biomarkers, you’ve got thousands of molecules floating around in your blood. And for the most part, only about 5% of them have really been really studied deeply, have good elucidated structural biology behind them, or even are well understood. So, 95% of biology in that situation is really not well characterized. Where AI is helpful is, you start thinking through all the permutations of chemistry and biology and trying to simulate things before you put them into a wet lab. Think of them like a dry lab. It allows you to iterate through things much faster. A few examples: One is, we look at the amount of time it takes to do something, and we decide to pursue a lead to the time it takes to do tox studies. And we’ve been able to cut about 25% of that time out by incorporating AI and technology and doing a lot of these dry lab simulations. So that’s an example of where that would be. Research and development, we’re on track to cut almost three years off of our average clinical trial for the use of data, digital, and AI. So, it’s actually pretty pervasive in many parts of our time. GEN Edge: With those savings, what is that time to tox study and that time for trials with three years? Meyers: We don’t share that information publicly. We can tell you that we’re seeing meaningful changes in terms of the timelines. GEN Edge: BMS has its own in-house ChatGPT and Gen AI tools. How are they customized for BMS’ work? Meyers: Yeah, that’s a good question. In fact, we’ve had about 16,000 employees or active users of this tool. And what we’ve done behind the scenes is we are using OpenAI’s API, which we get through Microsoft Azure. But what we do in addition to that is we’ve also fine-tuned that tool on our own documentation. Think of it as you go to the tool today and if you ask it a question like how tall is the Eiffel Tower, it’s going to default to the base model on that, right? If you ask a question about something related to one of our products, like what is the ideal storage temperature of an unopened vial of [Opdivo®] nivolumab? There’s actually a document that’s been trained on that will give you an accurate answer, and it won’t hallucinate. It’ll default back to our protected amounts of information. That way, we want to make sure that certain information that is useful to the company, to people that are in important roles, we want to make sure they’re getting accurate information, not whatever happened to be on the internet that that will pick up on. And then finally, we also are moving toward self-service. All the IT helpdesk knowledge-based documents that our helpdesk people use have all been trained in the model. So, if you ask it a question like, how do I get a new laptop and mouse for an employee who starts next week? It’s going to actually be trained on all of our policies and procedures. It has been customized for BMS to not only",

        "description": "Why have BMS investors been anything but positive about acquiring 2seventy? The answer stems from uncertainty over how competitive Abecma will continue to be in the multiple myeloma space given an existing blockbuster rival, and the prospect of a new competitor drug coming next year. The post StockWatch: Will BMS–2seventy Deal Prove a Win-Win? appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. 2seventy bio investors were understandably happy this past week when Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) agreed to acquire its partner in developing the blockbuster multiple myeloma drug Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel), 2seventy bio, for approximately $286 million. The pending deal sent 2seventy shares soaring 77%. However, BMS shares slipped 6.5% this week on news of the acquisition, sliding from $63.11 the day before the announcement to $59.01 at Friday’s closing bell. Why have BMS investors been anything but positive about acquiring 2seventy? The answer stems from uncertainty over how competitive Abecma will continue to be in the multiple myeloma space given an existing blockbuster rival and the prospect of a new competitor drug coming next year. Both of them, like Abecma, fight multiple myeloma by targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). According to BMS, Abecma generated a total of $406 million in worldwide product revenue, most of which consisted of $242 million in U.S. revenue. Worldwide revenue for Abecma fell 14% from 2023 overall, which despite a 44% jump in ex-U.S. revenues could not make up for declining U.S. revenue. However, U.S. revenue remained within 2seventy’s guidance to investors of between $240 million and $250 million. U.S. commercial revenue is split between 2seventy and BMS, which said U.S. revenue fell 32% from 2023. Even more sobering for Abecma, BMS took a $122 million impairment charge for the drug during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company’s Form 10-K annual report for 2024, which said the move was “primarily resulting from a reduced cash flow forecast due to the evolving competitive landscape.” “The impairment charge represented a full write-down of the asset,” BMS added. The competitive landscape is now dominated by Carvykti® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), the BCMA-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy co-marketed by Janssen Biotech (Johnson & Johnson) and Legend Biotech. Carvykti finished 2024 with more than twice the annual sales of Abecma—$963 million in worldwide sales, up nearly double (93%) from $500 million in 2023. Broader label A key reason why Carvykti enjoys greater sales is its broader prescribing label compared with Abecma. While both drugs were approved for earlier than fourth line treatment of multiple myeloma last year, Abecma can only be prescribed for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in patients previously treated with two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Carvykti, however, is indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and are refractory to lenalidomide. “By the end of this year, we fully expect that two-thirds or maybe three-quarters of our revenue will come in from second to fourth line,” Legend Bio CEO Ying Huang, PhD, told analysts on the company’s quarterly earnings call Tuesday. “Therefore, we think we’re very well positioned to enter into 2026 because by then, the large overwhelming majority of our revenue mix will come in from the second to fourth line. Jefferies equity analyst Kelly Shi, PhD, predicts sales of Carvykti will nearly double again this year. “We see sales growth momentum to continue in 2025, reaching $1.9B (+92% [year over year]), driven primarily by strong 2-4 L demand and manuf[acturing] expansion,” Shi wrote in a research note. At peak year, J&J expects Carvykti peak sales to exceed $5 billion, CFO Joseph Wolk said last year, though Morgan Stanley has projected approximately $8 billion for the drug, vs. about $5 billion for Abecma. But as a few other analysts noted in research notes this past week, the competitive landscape in multiple myeloma may change significantly next year, when Kite, a Gilead company, and Arcellx are expected to launch their own BCMA-targeting multiple myeloma treatment. That treatment is anitocabtagene autoleucel (“anito-cel”), a BCMA-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy that uses Arcellx’s novel binder (or CAR) known as the D-Domain. Kite and Arcellx reason that anito-cel is effective because its small size (8 kilodaltons) facilitates high T-cell transduction and expression, resulting in more CAR positive cells and more CARs expressed per T cell. Positive preliminary data At the American Society of Hematology 2024 Annual Meeting (ASH 2024), held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, Arcellx presented positive preliminary data from 58 patients in the registrational Phase II pivotal iMMagine-1 trial (NCT05396885), showing a 95% overall response rate (ORR) and a 62% complete response/stringent complete response rate (CR/sCR) at a median follow-up of 10.3 months. Even more impressive: Of the 39 patients evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, 36 (92%) achieved MRD negativity at least to the level of 10-5. Patients also showed a Kaplan–Meier-estimated six-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 90% with individual patients ranging from 77% to 96%. The patients’ overall survival (OS) rate was 95%, with individual patients ranging from 85% to 98%. An earlier Phase I study in 38 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had ≥3 prior lines of therapy demonstrated ORR of 100%, a CR/sCR rate of 76%, and an estimated 24-month PFS rate of 56%. Both the Phase I and Phase II trials showed no reports of patients with delayed neurotoxicity, cranial nerve palsies, Guillain Barre syndrome, or Parkinsonian-like symptoms, the researchers added. “Thus far, anito-cel has an efficacy profile in line with market leader Carvykti, and movement neurotoxicity (MNT) safety profile in line with Abecma—threatening Abecma’s niche as the option for patients who want to avoid the risk of MNTs like Parkinsonism,” Leerink Partners analyst Daina M. Graybosch, PhD, cautioned in a research note. “Any acquirer still has to consider market uncertainty with Kite/Arcellx’s expected 2026 launch of a third BCMA CAR-T, anito-cel,” added Graybosch. She downgraded the firm’s rating on 2seventy from “Outperform” to “Market Perform” and lowered its 12-month price target from $9 to $5 a share. William Blair analyst Matt Phipps, PhD, wrote in a research note that the competitive landscape wasn’t enough to short-circuit BMS’ acquisition of 2seventy, but was reason for concern. “Headwinds for Abecma” “We see little risk to the [BMS-2seventy] deal, but also acknowledge the headwinds for Abecma given the competitive landscape in multiple myeloma, and therefore do not believe this materially changes the outlook for the company,” Phipps wrote, referring to BMS. He reiterated the firm’s “Market Perform” rating on BMS shares. Sami Corwin, PhD, Phipps’ colleague at William Blair who is also a biotech analyst, noted separately that Kite and Arcellx are expected to release updated results from iMMagine-1 “which we believe will be a significant catalyst for the stock and could further de-risk a future regulatory submission. Corwin said the interim data presented for anito-cel seen in iMMagine-1 last fall were comparable to Janssen’s Phase Ib/II CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) assessing Carvykti, completed in 2022—but with “clear safety benefits” that included lower cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) rates, and death rates attributable to treatment. Other positives for Arcellx, she wrote, was its partnership with Kite given its abilities as a strategic partner and the economics of the collaboration. The companies announced their collaboration in December 2022, with Kite at the time agreeing to pay Arcellx $225 million in upfront cash, a $100 million equity investment, and other unspecified payments tied to milestones. In November 2023, the companies expanded their collaboration to include lymphomas, with Kite agreeing in return to pay Arcellx an additional upfront non-dilutive cash payment of $85 million and another equity investment of $200 million, plus additional milestone payments that include advancement of a lymphoma program and a possible future license by Kite to Arcellx’s ACLX-001 multiple myeloma program based on Arcellx’s ARC-SparX platform. The companies could generate even more money with an expanded label for anito-cel. “Although the near-term focus for anito-cel will center around the potential launch in the late-line setting, we think expansion into the early-line setting could shortly follow if the companies leverage MRD-negativity as a surrogate endpoint in the iMMagine-3 study for accelerated approval,” Corwin added. Leaders and laggards Applied DNA Sciences (NASDAQ: APDN) shares plummeted 57% from $7.50 to an even $3 on Wednesday after the company announced a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock that took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Friday. Applied said the reverse stock split was intended to bring it into compliance with the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Applied DNA will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “APDN” with a new CUSIP number of 03815U 508. MeiraGTx Holdings (MGTX) shares jumped 29% from $6.41 to $8.25 on Thursday after the company said it formed a joint venture with Hologen AI to fully finance the development of AAV-GAD",

        "description": "The deal, announced late Monday, caps a turbulent three years for 2seventy bio. The company served as the oncology business of Bluebird Bio until Bluebird spun out 2seventy in 2021. The post BMS to Acquire Abecma Partner 2seventy bio for $286M appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) plans to buy out its partner in developing the blockbuster multiple myeloma drug Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel), by agreeing to acquire 2seventy bio for approximately $286 million, the companies said. The deal, announced late Monday, caps a turbulent three years for 2seventy bio. The company served as the oncology business of Bluebird Bio until Bluebird spun out 2seventy in 2021. Bluebird’s longtime CEO or “chief Bluebird” Nick Leschly served as 2seventy’s first CEO or “chief kairos officer” until he stepped down last year when current CEO Chip Baird’s appointment took effect, with Leschly becoming chairman. The turnover at the top followed 2seventy’s inability to reverse net losses that reached $217.57 million in 2023, on revenue of just $100.387 million. 2seventy responded in September 2023 with a restructuring that eliminated 40% of its workforce, followed by an additional 14% workforce reduction (about 30 jobs) in January 2024 after the company narrowed its focus exclusively to commercialization and further development of Abecma with BMS. Abecma is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy that first won FDA approval in 2021 as the first FDA-approved chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) cell therapy indicated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma following four or more lines of therapy. Following a label expansion last year, Abecma is now indicated to treat adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The companies oversee a clinical development program for Abecma that includes two ongoing clinical studies in earlier lines of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, KarMMa-2 (NCT03601078) and KarMMa-3 (NCT03651128). Reduced red ink 2seventy’s narrowing of focus, plus job cuts, helped reduce the company’s red ink for the first nine months of 2024 to a net loss of $37.727 million, compared with a $160.748 million net loss for January–September 2023. Abecma generated U.S. revenue of $242 million in 2024, within 2seventy’s earlier-issued guidance to investors of between $240 million and $250 million. U.S. commercial revenue is split between 2seventy and BMS, which said U.S. revenue fell 32% from 2023. “A year ago, 2seventy decided to exclusively focus on unlocking the value of Abecma, with the goal of delivering more time for people living with multiple myeloma and maximizing value for all stakeholders,” Baird said in a statement. “We believe that Abecma will continue to benefit from BMS’ experience and resources to ensure this important therapy is delivered to patients who need it.” Leerink Partners analyst Daina M. Graybosch, PhD, expressed more caution on the BMS-2seventy combination. “BMY’s acquisition of 2seventy bio (TSVT) shows modest confidence in the near-term profit potential of the companies’ shared autologous BCMA CAR-T Abecma (ide-cel),” Graybosch wrote in a research note. “By our estimates, BMY could realize a return in as little as two years, based on saved profit-sharing expenses payable to 2seventy (as part of their prior partnership agreement). While the deal value of $286 million is 41% below Leerink’s prior discounted cash flow valuation of $487 million for 2seventy, “we do not expect that an alternative acquirer will emerge, and expect that the transaction with BMY will close,” Graybosch predicted. “2seventy has been successful since their 2023 reorganization in optimizing their business for strategic optionality, but their focus has been on trimming the cost base.” BMS will need to consider a competitive challenge for Abecma, the Leerink analyst cautioned, citing the expected 2026 launch of “anito-cel” by Kite, a Gilead company, and Arcellx. “Thus far, anito-cel has an efficacy profile in line with market leader Carvykti, and movement neurotoxicity (MNT) safety profile in line with Abecma—threatening Abecma’s niche as the option for patients who want to avoid the risk of MNTs like Parkinsonism,” Graybosch added. She downgraded the firm’s rating on 2seventy from “Outperform” to “Market Perform” and lowered its 12-month price target from $9 to $5 a share. Bluebird Bio last month entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by funds managed by publicly-traded Carlyle and privately-held SK Capital Partners, partnering with a team of veteran biotech executives led by former Mirati Therapeutics CEO David Meek. Shrinking workforce 2seventy’s workforce shrunk from 437 full-time employees as of March 1, 2022, about a year after the spinout was completed, to 425 full-time employees as of February 1, 2023, to 274 employees the same day a year later, according to Form 10-K annual reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, 2seventy shed 160 jobs last year when it sold its cell therapy pipeline and operations to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for at least $15 million, including its bbT369 program in b-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (b-NHL), its SC-DARIC33 program in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MUC16 in ovarian cancer, a T-cell receptor (TCR) program targeting MAGE-A4 in cancers, and several unnamed targets. Regeneron transformed the assets into a new Regeneron Cell Medicines business led by 2seventy’s former CSO Philip Gregory. In December, Regeneron paid a $1 million milestone payment to Medigene, whose end-to-end platform generated the TCRs applied in Regeneron’s MAGE-A4-TCR program. The payment followed an unspecified development milestone for the program occurring in a clinical trial in China led by JW Therapeutics, a prior collaborator of 2seventy bio—the first clinical use of the platform, Medigene stated at the time. At $5 per share, the acquisition deal represents an 88% premium to 2seventy’s closing stock price of $2.66 on Friday. While the deal has a total equity value of approximately $286 million, the net value shrinks to $102 million after accounting for 2seventy’s approximately $184 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, disclosed last month. BMS said it will begin a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of 2seventy bio in an all-cash transaction unanimously recommended by 2seventy’s board. The companies said stockholders owning approximately 5.3% of 2seventy’s outstanding shares have agreed to tender all of their owned shares in the offer. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of most of the outstanding shares of 2seventy’s common stock and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Upon successful closing of the tender offer, BMS said it will acquire all remaining shares of 2seventy’s common stock that are not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same $5 per share as the tender offer. 2seventy’s common stock will no longer be listed for trading on Nasdaq. 2seventy investors roared their approval of the deal by sending the company’s shares rocketing 77% from $2.80 to $4.95 Tuesday in early trading as of 11:15 a.m. ET. BMS shares dipped 2%, from $63.11 to $61.79. “The strategic rationale for this acquisition is clear and today’s announcement represents the culmination of the journey for 2seventy bio,” Baird added.
