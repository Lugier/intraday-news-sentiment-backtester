Title: Stock Movers: WPP, Qualcomm, Telefonica (podcast)
Date: 2025-06-09 10:51:54

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Qualcomm to acquire Alphawave for $2.4B
Date: 2025-06-09 10:40:33
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The acquisition news is likely already known or anticipated to some extent, which reduces the immediate surprise factor.

Title: US chipmaker Qualcomm agrees to buy UK’s Alphawave in $2.4bn deal
Date: 2025-06-09 09:13:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While a $2.4bn acquisition is a significant amount, the immediate impact on QCOM's stock price within 60 minutes is likely neutral. The market will need time to digest the implications of this acquisition and its integration with Qualcomm's existing business; the magnitude of the deal is not immediately quantifiable in terms of revenue or earnings changes in the very short term. This news is unlikely to trigger immediate FOMO buying or panic selling.

Title: Why Qualcomm is paying $2.4 billion for Britain’s Alphawave
Date: 2025-06-09 08:55:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The $2.4 billion acquisition cost could initially pressure QCOM shares as investors assess the deal's value and potential integration challenges in the short term.

Title: Qualcomm to Buy Alphawave IP for $2.4 Billion
Date: 2025-06-09 08:28:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: A $2.4 billion acquisition represents a sizable investment but the news alone isn't sufficiently impactful or surprising to move QCOM's price significantly in the next 60 minutes. The market needs more details regarding Alphawave IP's technology and how it fits into Qualcomm's overall strategy for a decisive directional move, resulting in limited immediate impact.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Qualcomm Agrees to Buy UK-Listed Alphawave for $2.4 Billion
Date: 2025-06-09 08:19:02
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While M&A activity is a catalyst, the immediate impact is likely minimal. The $2.4 billion acquisition doesn't drastically alter Qualcomm's financials in the very short term.

Date: 2025-06-04 01:45:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of "limited, targeted exploitation" of zero-day vulnerabilities, even with a patch release, creates immediate uncertainty and potential concern for QCOM customers and investors.

Date: 2025-05-01 15:48:24
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news states that Qualcomm (QCOM) fell after its revenue forecast came in below estimates. This is a direct negative impact as it's a quantifiable data miss relative to expectations, immediately triggering likely selling pressure.

Date: 2025-04-30 22:37:29
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While Q2 revenue beat expectations, the critical piece is the forward guidance, which forecasts Q3 revenue slightly below estimates.

This unexpected slip implies traders are reacting negatively, potentially due to profit-taking or concern about underlying details, creating negative sentiment. The magnitude of this negative reaction, though uncertain, necessitates a negative classification for the immediate 60-minute window.

Title: Qualcomm Q2 earnings on deck: Eyes on guidance amid macro headwinds
Date: 2025-04-29 18:22:02
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title indicates a preview of upcoming earnings. While earnings reports are catalysts, this is a *preview*, meaning it's anticipatory and provides no concrete data. This lacks the surprise factor needed for a significant immediate price movement in either direction; thus, it's unlikely to cause a directional price swing within 60 minutes.

Explanation: The news reports projected revenue and earnings figures, which are projected to increase by 13% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, and $2.81 per share respectively. This indicates potential for the company to perform well, leading to increased confidence, and likely short-term positive price movement, especially as these figures are according to "consensus estimates", meaning they are expected.

Title: Qualcomm likely to report in-line results, but guidance could be weak, UBS says
Date: 2025-04-22 19:41:30
