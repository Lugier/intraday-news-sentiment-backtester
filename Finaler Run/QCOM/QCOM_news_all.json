        "description": "Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. The large cloud market piqued the interest of other CPU makers including Qualcomm. Qualcomm had grown to become a formidable force in the mobile SoC market by the mid-2010s, and had several in-house CPU designs under their belt. They had good reason to be confident about their cloud server prospects. High core counts in server chips translate to low per-core power, blunting AMD and Intel’s greatest strength of high single threaded performance.From a 2017 Qualcomm presentationMeanwhile, Qualcomm’s mobile background gave them plenty of experience in low power CPU design. Their high mobile volume gave them access to Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. That could at least level the playing field against Intel’s 14nm node, if not give Qualcomm an outright advantage in power consumption and density. Qualcomm hoped to use those factors to deliver a cheaper, lower power competitor on the cloud computing scene.To break into the cloud computing segment, Qualcomm needed a CPU architecture with enough performance to meet key metrics in areas like tail-end latency. During a Hot Chips presentation, Qualcomm noted that throwing a pile of weak cores onto a chip and calling it day wouldn’t cut it. An Arm cloud CPU may not have to match Intel and AMD core for core, but they do need to hit a baseline level of performance. Qualcomm hopes to do that while maintaining their traditional power and density advantages.Core OverviewThe Falkor CPU architecture aims to meet that performance threshold with low power and silicon area requirements. Falkor is a 4-wide aarch64 core with features inherited from Qualcomm’s prior mobile cores. It runs the 64-bit Arm instruction set (aarch64, armv8) with a few features pulled in from armv8.1. 32-bit Arm support is absent, as there’s no large existing install base of Arm server applications. Falkor is Qualcomm’s 5th in-house core design, and the company’s first designed specifically for cloud computing.A Centriq 2400 series chip packs up to 48 Falkor cores on a 398mm2 die with a 120W TDP. That translates to less than 2.5W per core. Qualcomm notes that power consumption is usually well under 120W in typical all-core loads.Qualcomm slide showing Centriq server SKUsFor this article, Neggles (Andi) was given a Centriq 2452 system from the folks at Corellium at no cost in order for us to test it. So a massive shout out to both Corellium for providing the system as well as to Neggles for getting the system up and running. The Centriq 2452 system is set up with 96 GB of DDR4 running at 2666 MT/s, and identifies itself as the “Qualcomm Centriq 2400 Reference Evaluation Platform CV90-LA115-P23”.FrontendFalkor has both a L0 and L1 instruction cache like Qualcomm’s prior Krait architecture, and possibly Kryo too. The 24 KB, 3-way set associative L0 delivers instructions at lower power and with lower latency. The L0 is sized to contain the large majority of instruction fetches, while the 64 KB 8-way L1 instruction cache handles larger code footprints. Although the L0 fills a similar role to micro-op caches and loop buffers in other CPUs, it holds ISA instruction bytes just like a conventional instruction cache.Both instruction cache levels have enough bandwidth to feed Falkor’s 4-wide decoder. The two instruction cache levels are exclusive of each other, so the core effectively has 88 KB of instruction cache capacity. Qualcomm might use a victim cache setup to maintain that exclusive relationship. If so, incoming probes would have to check both the L0 and L1, and L1 accesses would incur the additional cost of a copy-back from L0 on top of a fill into L0. An inclusive setup would let the L1 act as a snoop filter for the L0 and reduces the cost of L1 accesses, but has less total caching capacity.The exclusive L0/L1 setup gives Falkor high instruction caching capacity compared to contemporary cores. Falkor wouldn't be beaten in this respect until Apple's M1 launched several years later. High instruction cache capacity makes L2 code fetch bandwidth less important. Like many 64-bit Arm cores of the time, or indeed AMD's pre-Zen cores, Falkor's instruction throughput drops sharply once code spills into L2. Still, Faklor performs better than A72 in that respect.Falkor's instruction caches are parity protected, as is common for many CPUs. Hardware resolves parity errors by invalidating corrupted lines and reloading them from L2. The instruction caches also hold branch targets alongside instruction bytes, and therefore serve as branch target buffers (BTBs). A single cache access provides both instructions and branch targets, so Falkor doesn't have to make a separate BTB access like cores with a decoupled BTB do. However, that prevents the branch predictor from following the instruction stream past a L1i miss.Taken branches incur one pipeline bubble (2 cycle latency) within L0, and up to 6 cycle latency from L1. For smaller branch footprints, Falkor do zero-bubble taken branches using a 16 entry branch target instruction cache (BTIC). Unlike a BTB, the BTIC caches instructions at the branch destination rather than the target address. It therefore bypasses cache latency, and allows zero-bubble taken branches without needing to make a L0 achieve single cycle latency.Direction prediction uses multiple history tables, each using a different history length. The branch predictor tracks which history length and corresponding table works best for a given branch. The scheme described by Qualcomm is conceptually similar to a TAGE predictor, which also uses multiple history tables and tags tables to indicate whether they’re useful for a given branch. Falkor doesn’t necessarily use a classic TAGE predictor. For example, the history lengths may not be in a geometric series. But the idea of economizing history storage by using the most appropriate history length for each branch still stands. Arm’s Cortex A72 uses a 2-level predictor, presumably with a single table and a fixed history length.In an abstract test with varying numbers of branches, each being taken or not-taken in random patterns of increasing length, Falkor does slightly better than Kryo. Falkor handles better with a lot of branches in play, though the longest repeating pattern either core can handle is similar for a small number of branches.Falkor a two-level indirect target array for indirect branches, which read a target from a register rather than specifying a jump distance. An indirect branch may go to different targets, adding another dimension of difficulty to branch prediction. Falkor’s first level indirect target array has 16 entries, while a second level has 512 entries.Having multiple targets for an indirect branch carries little penalty as long as total target count doesn’t exceed 16. That can be one branch switching between 16 targets, or eight branches alternating between two targets each.Returns are a special case of indirect branches, because they typically go back to the call site. Falkor has a 16 entry return stack like Kryo. Cortex A72 has a much larger return stack with 31 entries. A function call and return costs approximately four cycles on Falkor, Kryo, and A72, which would be an average of 2 cycles per branch-with-link instruction.Falkor’s decoders translate up to four instructions per cycle into micro-ops. Like most other CPUs, Qualcomm aims to decode most common instructions into a single micro-op. 128-bit vector math instructions appear to be a notable exception.Rename/AllocateMicro-ops from the decoders need resources allocated in the backend for bookkeeping during out-of-order execution. Falkor’s renamer can handle register renaming and resource allocation for up to for micro-ops per cycle. However, the fourth slot can only process direct branches and a few specialized cases like NOPs or recognized register zeroing cases. A conditional branch that also includes an ALU operation, like cbz/cbnz, cannot go into the fourth slot.Slide from Qualcomm’s Hot Chips presentationBesides special handling for zeroing registers by moving an immediate value of zero into it, I didn’t see other common optimizations carried out.There’s no MOV elimination, and the renamer doesn’t recognize that XOR-ing or subtracting a register from itself results in zero.Out-of-Order ExecutionFalkor doesn’t have a classic reorder buffer, or ROB. Rather, it uses a series of structures that together enable out-of-order execution while ensuring program results are consistent with in-order execution. Falkor has a 256 entry rename/completion buffer. Qualcomm further states Falkor can have 128 uncommitted instructions in flight, along with another 70+ uncommitted instructions for a total of 190 in-flight instructions. The core can retire 4 instructions per cycle.From a microbenchmarking perspective, Falkor acts like Arm’s Cortex A73. It can free resources like registers and load/store queue entries past a long latency load, with no visible limit to reordering capacity even past 256 instructions. An unresolved branch similarly blocks out-of-order resource deallocation, after which Falkor’s reordering window can be measured. At that point, I may be measuring what Qualcomm considers uncommitted instructions.Kryo and Falkor have similar reordering capacity from that uncommitted instruction perspective. But otherwise Qualcomm has re-balanced the execution engine to favor consistent performance for non-vector code. Falkor has a few more register file entries than Kryo, and more crucially, far larger memory ordering queues.Integer execution pipelines on Falkor are specialized to handle different categories of operations from each other. Three pipes have integer ALUs, and a fourth pipe is dedicated to direct branches. Indirect branches use one o",

        "description": "Surface Laptop Studio 2 is reportedly no longer being manufactured. Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay left the company for Amazon in late 2023, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New smaller versions of both of these mainstays were introduced just a couple of weeks ago. But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge reports that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold. Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with its six-year support lifecycle for Surface hardware.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.That enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.The company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.Thanks to the prescience of Nvidia's leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.AMDAMD, led by CEO Lisa Su, lags behind Nvidia but remains its most serious competitor.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD is Nvidia's top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center. Helmed by its formidable CEO Lisa Su, AMD launched its own GPU, called the MI300, for the data center in 2024, more than a full year after Nvidia's second generation of data center GPUs started shipping.Though experts and analysts have touted the chip's specifications and potential based on its design and architecture, the company's software is still somewhat behind that of Nvidia, making these chips somewhat harder to program and use to their full potential.Analysts predict that the company has under 15% market share. But AMD executives insist that they are committed to bringing its software up to par and that future expectations for the evolution of the accelerated computing market will benefit the company — specifically, the spread of AI into so-called edge devices like phones and laptops.Qualcomm, Broadcom, and custom chipsAlso challenging Nvidia are application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. These custom-designed chips are less versatile than GPUs, but they can be designed for specific AI computing workloads at a much lower cost, which have made them a popular option for hyperscalers.Though multipurpose chips like Nvidia's and AMD's graphics processing units are likely to maintain the largest share of the AI-chip market in the long term, custom chips are growing fast. Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.Companies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.Marvell is in part responsible for Amazon's Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google's tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.Amazon and GoogleWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.Amazon's Trainium chips and Google's TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia chips, mostly for the companies' internal AI workloads. However, the companies have shown some progress in getting customers and partners to use their chips as well. Anthropic has committed to running some workloads on Amazon's chips, and Apple has done the same with Google's.IntelIntel and its Gaudi line of AI chips has struggled to compete with Nvidia and AMD.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesOnce the great American name in chip-making, Intel has fallen far behind its competitors in the age of AI. But, the firm does have a line of AI chips called Gaudi that some reports have said can stand up to Nvidia's in some respects.Intel installed a new CEO, semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan, in the first quarter of 2025 and one of his first actions was to flatten the organization so that the AI chip operations reports directly to him.HuaweiThough Nvidia's American hopeful challengers are many, China's Huawei is perhaps the most concerning competitor of all for Nvidia and all those concerned with continued US supremacy in AI.Huang himself has called Huawei the \"single most formidable\" tech company in China. Reports that Huawei's AI chip innovation is catching up are increasing in frequency. New restrictions from the Biden and Trump administrations on shipping even lower-power GPUs to China have further incentivized the company to catch up and serve the Chinese markets for AI. Analysts say further restrictions being considered by the Trump administration are now unlikely to hamper China's AI progress.StartupsAlso challenging Nvidia are a host of startups offering new chip designs and business models to the AI computing market.These firms are starting out at a disadvantage, as they don't have the full-sized sales and distribution machines decades of chip sales in other types of tech bring. But several are holding their own by finding use cases, customers, and distribution methods that are attractive to customers based on faster processing speeds or lower cost. These new AI players include Cerebras, Etched, Groq, Positron AI, Sambanova Systems, and Tenstorrent, among others.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.That enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.The company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.Thanks to the prescience of Nvidia's leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.AMDAMD, led by CEO Lisa Su, lags behind Nvidia but remains its most serious competitor.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD is Nvidia's top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center.

This included a 100% tariff on rapeseed oil, rapeseed meal, and peas, as well as a 25% tariff on some seafood and pork products.China's finance ministry said the retaliatory tariffs were in response to Canada's levies on Chinese steel, aluminum, and electric vehicles.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said Tuesday (March 11) that artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in the next fundamental shift in how humans interact with technology, describing it as a “generation change” poised to reshape the tech landscape and redefine user experiences across devices. “We are at the beginning of a very big transition in technology,” Amon said during a speech at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. “AI is a generation change. It’s going to change a lot how we interact with our computers.” The CEO outlined a historical progression of how humans interacted with computers — from using an ASCII keyboard to type into a computer, to graphical and use of a mouse, to touchscreens on mobile devices. AI is ushering in the next leap forward. “Something happened with the AI,” Amon said. “The computers can understand human language, and because the computer can understand human language, it changes again how we interact with computers.” According to Amon, rather than navigating between different apps for specific tasks, users will interact with AI agents that understand context and can seamlessly perform tasks across multiple domains. Today, “you go to different apps and do different things. But once the AI understands your intention, they are free. It can go to an app. It can go to another app,” Amon said. “Apps are built on top of the agent, so it changes, and it’s going to be this assistant that you have with you all the time.” For example, a traveler on vacation takes photos and videos. The AI agent automatically organizes them and adds information. It can also suggest dining options based on its knowledge of the traveler’s preferences and juxtaposes that with its knowledge of eateries at the vacation spot. The AI agent does all these without asking the traveler to use different apps. “You’re going to have different inputs, whether it’s voice and audio, or text. … Every text that you write could be a prompt for a model and for an agent to understand what you do and then be ready to help you when you need help,” Amon explained. Amon emphasized that this transformation extends beyond smartphones to other devices, such as automobiles and wearable technology like augmented reality (AR) glasses. Amon called AR glasses “wearable AI,” highlighting Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses as an example of this emerging technology. “When you wear those glasses, what you see the glass sees, what you hear the glass hears,” he explained, enabling seamless AI assistance based on real-world context. He also described cars as “a new computing space” where agent-based interfaces are particularly well-suited, allowing drivers to interact naturally through voice and visual cues. “The car is now a new computing space, like a phone was computing space. Your laptop’s a computing space,” Amon said. “This type of agent-based user experience is perfect when you are driving a car — voice is very natural, visual is very natural.” Amon said AI as the new user interface could be ubiquitous within five years, with edge computing further hastening the transition. This on-device AI processing is what Amon referred to as “AI at the edge.” This approach offers advantages in speed, privacy, reliability and cost compared to cloud-based alternatives, he said. “When you do the processing on the device, it’s immediate. You don’t have to wait. It’s private. It’s your data. It’s your personal graph that stays with you,” Amon said. “Every time you run an AI on the cloud, versus you running the computer that you have in your hand now, that’s your computer. It runs on that at no cost to you.” Amon said Qualcomm wants its chips to enable all these experiences at the edge, or on-device. The AI revolution is the latest chapter in Qualcomm’s 40-year history of driving technological transformation, from pioneering mobile communications to integrating consumer electronics into smartphones, and now to enabling on-device AI processing. “We are like a real technology company,” Amon stated. “We’re the No. 1 patent holder in the United States, we have created a lot of fundamental technologies.” He said Qualcomm technology is present in devices people use daily, even if they aren’t aware of it.

President Trump will reportedly meet with top U.S. tech companies facing tariff-related pressure. The CEOs of IBM, Intel, Qualcomm and HP will gather at the White House on Monday (March 10), Bloomberg News reported Thursday (March 6), citing sources familiar with the matter and a spokesperson for HP. “Some of the topics top-of-mind for our leadership team are trade policy and U.S. manufacturing,” that spokesperson said. As Bloomberg notes, the Trump administration is pushing several policy changes that could threaten computer hardware makers. For example, new tariffs on manufacturing centers like China could drive up costs and hinder supply chains. In addition, the report added, tech companies are also seeking clarity about possible restrictions on their exports of technology for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are being constructed around the globe. The meeting is happening as businesses from a range of sectors are feeling pressure from the tariffs, imposed on Canada, Mexico and China and covering a range of goods. For example, a report Wednesday (March 5) by the Wall Street Journal found that toy companies are bracing themselves for the impact of the tariffs. These companies are concerned about where they will source their products, how they will stay on top of growing costs and how consumers will react to higher prices. While some larger toymakers are renegotiating with vendors and shifting production to other countries, smaller companies have fewer options and could be forced to absorb the added costs if they cannot pass them along to buyers in the form of higher prices. Meanwhile, Best Buy said earlier this week that tariffs on China could have a negative effect of about one point of comparable sales if they stayed in place for a full year. “While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,” CEO Corie Barry said during the company’s earnings call. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that at least 60% of CFOs see their companies facing greater uncertainty and challenges due to the tariffs. “Reconfiguring supply chains is no panacea, as it costs time and money,” PYMNTS wrote recently. “Moreover, domestic supply chains would become more competitive, as near-shoring or onshoring materials would mean greater competition for suppliers on higher demand and, thus, supply crunches.” The post Trump Sets Meeting With Tech CEOs As Tariff Pressures Set In appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",
