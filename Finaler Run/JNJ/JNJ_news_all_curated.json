Johnson & Johnson reportedly found that 10% to 15% of artificial intelligence use cases deliver 80% of the value. The medicine and MedTech company determined that after encouraging employees to experiment with AI and, after about three years, seeing the results of their pursuits of nearly 900 use cases, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Friday (April 18). Johnson & Johnson is now devoting resources to the highest-value projects and cutting the rest, according to the report. “We’re prioritizing, we’re scaling, we’re looking at the things that make the most sense,” Johnson & Johnson Chief Information Officer Jim Swanson said, per the report. “That was part of the maturation process we went through.” The use cases that are delivering the most value include a generative AI copilot that coaches sales representatives on how to engage with healthcare professionals, and an internal chatbot that answers employees’ questions about company policies and benefits, according to the report. Johnson & Johnson is also developing an AI tool that will facilitate drug discovery and another that will identify and mitigate supply chain risks, per the report. Swanson said in the report that the broader approach was necessary three years ago to gain familiarity with the technology but that it’s now time to focus on the use cases that can be successfully implemented, are widely adopted and deliver value. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The AI MonitorEdge Report: Healthcare Firms Going Long on GenAI Investment” found that 90% of C-suite executives at healthcare firms with at least $1 billion in annual revenue said that their previous generative AI investments have already achieved a positive return on investment. The two applications that represent the most frequent use cases of generative AI — product and service innovation and real-time automated customer service responses — are being used by about 6 in 10 of these healthcare firms, per the report. It was reported in March that Apple is working on an AI agent that can dispense medical advice. Healthcare AI firm Suki said in October that it raised $70 million in new funding to invest in the development of its products, which include an AI-powered voice assistant used by clinicians. In October 2023, Microsoft unveiled AI-powered products that help doctors glean insights from medical data. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "When Johnson & Johnson launched the first disposable diaper in 1948, it revolutionized modern parenting. But it also, unwittingly, created an environmental disaster. Diapers are largely made of plastic, which does not biodegrade, but breaks into microplastics that pollute our waterways and end up in our food chain. And yet, more than 300,000 diapers are thrown out every minute, bound for landfills or incinerators, and accelerating climate change.[Photo: Hiro]There’s now a movement to design a more eco-friendly diaper, from creating easier-to-use cloth diapering systems to diapers that use less plastic. But Hiro, a newly launched startup, may have the most creative solution yet. It has launched a diaper that comes with a packet of plastic-eating fungi, which the company says will enable the diaper to biodegrade in the landfill.The startup is the brainchild of two serial entrepreneurs: Miki Agrawal, founder of Thinx period underwear and Tushy bidets, and Tero Isokauppila, founder of mushroom coffee brand Four Sigmatic. Agrawal has always been interested in tackling taboo issues, and when her son Hiro was born, she wanted to develop a diaper that was less harmful to the planet. That’s when she met Isokauppila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has devoted his entire career to making mushrooms more mainstream.[Photo: Hiro]A Fungi FanGrowing up, Isokauppila worked on the farm his family has tended since 1619. His work partly involved tending to mushrooms, which sparked a lifelong fascination with the plant. He went on to study fungi in college, learning about their powers as superfoods as well their ability to help other materials decompose. His knowledge of the a fungi’s nutrients to launch Four Sigmatic, which sells coffee that incorporates functional mushrooms.Now, Isokauppila is interested in how fungi can help us tackle the plastic crisis. Unlike other plants, mushrooms do not use photosynthesis to create energy. Instead, they need external food sources, and over the past 2.4 billion years they have existed, they have evolved to consume all kinds of materials. “In the earliest days of our planet’s existence, they ate rocks,” says Isokauppila. “When trees started growing, they evolved to consume trees, helping to transform them into fossil fuels.”About 15 years ago, a group of Yale undergraduates went to the Amazon and came across the first plastic-eating fungi. Plastic polymers are made of fossil fuels, and that’s a material that fungi has been interacting with for billions of years, according to Isokauppila. “My guess is that with so much plastic in our environment, fungi needed food, and plastic is fairly similar structurally to other materials it has consumed in the past,” says Isokauppila.[Photo: Hiro]The Plastic-Eating Hiro DiaperThere are now many scientists working on how to use fungi to process the enormous quantities of plastic in our environment, which accelerates the microplastics problem. In fact, there are already some solutions being developed. German scientists are trying to incorporate them into sewage treatment plants, while researchers from China and Pakistan identified plastic-eating fungi in a landfill in Islamabad. Even furniture companies are experimenting with additives that can help their plastic pieces degrade faster. Now Hiro is trying to use a strain of plastic-eating fungi in its diaper product.[Image: Hiro]Hiro diapers themselves are fairly typical. They have the same plastic content as other premium diapers and are made in a factory in Canada that produces diapers for other brands on the market. However, in the Hiro box, each diaper comes with a little packet of plastic-eating fungi that is dormant until it comes into contact with liquid. During changing time, you simply empty the whole pouch into the dirty diaper. This begins the process of biodegrading the plastic in the diaper. The company claims that within a year, the fungi in the diaper will completely consume the plastic.Isokauppila says that the goal is to incorporate the fungi directly into the Hiro diaper itself, to make the process more convenient. But when the company did focus groups with parents, they realized that they were very concerned about product safety, particularly since diapers make direct contact with the baby’s body. “Over time, we hope that with education, we show that the fungi is perfectly safe,” he says.Another question that comes up is whether the fungi is safe when released into the environment. Will it begin eating the plastic in trash bags or items in your environment that you don’t actually want to decompose? Isokauppila says that the decomposing process is slow, taking about a year. And once it is out in the wild—such as in the landfill—it will function much like other fungi in the environment. “They are already part of nature,” he says.[Photo: Hiro]Making Plastic-Eating Fungi WidespreadIsokauppila believes that the Hiro diaper can be a vehicle for popularizing plastic-eating fungi. As research begins to emerge around fungi that consume plastic, we will have more scalable solutions for tackling the enormous quantity of plastic that exists on our planet. But it is possible that consumers will find these solutions scary, partly because people in Western countries are just less familiar with mushrooms and fungi than in other parts of the world.“In Asian culture and in Eastern Europe, people love mushrooms and have eaten them for thousands of years,” he says. “But in Anglo-Saxon cultures, there has been a fear of mushrooms, which is known as mycophobia.” (It isn’t clear exactly why; anthropologists suggest that it is because there is more mold in England because of the rainy weather, or because the church rejected the use of psychedelic mushrooms.)Isokauppila wants to normalize the use of fungi to break down the plastics we use at home everyday. And over time, if we are able to scale the technology used in Hiro diapers, we could reverse the damage caused by our overuse of plastic.While fungi do offer a glimmer of hope in our fight against the overwhelming plastic pollution problem, scientists say our goal should still be to cut down on our use of plastic. For one thing, we still don’t have a solution to breaking down plastic at scale. But there’s also the fact that when fungi does break down plastic, it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change.Ultimately, our goal should be to avoid plastic entirely. But when that’s not possible—which is often—this is the next best solution. “If we can break down a diaper, we can break down anything,” he says. “Once we’ve gained enough market share, we can partner with other brands and bring this technology to the world.”",

        "description": "ChemImage, a small biotech company based in Pittsburgh, is taking the global healthcare company Johnson & Johnson to federal court in Manhattan.AP Photo/Ted ShaffreyJohnson & Johnson executives are scheduled to take the stand in a trial starting Monday.ChemImage, a small biotech firm, sued the healthcare giant over a 2019 partnership that went south.Johnson & Johnson had signed a multibillion-dollar contract with the Pittsburgh-based company.In 2019, Johnson & Johnson, hoping to compete in the growing surgical robotics field, signed a multibillion-dollar contract with a small biotech company called ChemImage.Based in Pittsburgh, ChemImage was pioneering AI-powered software that a surgeon could use in order to \"see\" what a robotic scalpel is doing. The images would help the surgeon form real-time assessments of damaged or cancerous tissue.On Monday, these former partners — the small biotech company and the global healthcare giant — are set to face off in federal court in Manhattan at a trial over a $1.5 billion breach of contract lawsuit ChemImage filed last spring.US District Judge Jesse Furman, who will preside over the weeklong bench trial, has since trimmed the allowable damages. If ChemImage prevails, it could win some $180 million in contract-termination penalties and other overdue payments.ChemImage has also asked the judge to restore all patents and intellectual property it developed under its contract with Johnson & Johnson. This would let the plaintiffs continue using and developing its imaging software.\"This is a case about J&J's decision to retreat from its failed play in surgical robotics, breaking the promises it made to ChemImage to develop its life-saving imaging technology,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"J&J's decision ultimately killed this family-founded company and its technology that could have vastly improved surgical outcomes for millions of people.\"What's undisputed is that two days after Christmas in 2019, ChemImage and the J&J subsidiary Ethicon entered into a 104-page \"Research, Development, License, and Commercialization Agreement.\"The contract set a payment schedule — ChemImage received $7 million up front — and established milestones for future payments and as much as $1.5 billion in eventual royalties.Also undisputed is that in April 2023 — with the effort to meld ChemImage's software and J&J's robotics mired in delay and no commercially viable product in sight — the contract blew up.The judge is tasked with determining whether J&J pulled the contract for good reason — \"with cause.\" If so, ChemImage would be entitled to no damages at all.Alternately, if J&J pulled the contract for no valid reason — without cause — the healthcare company would have been required to give ChemImage a 120-day notice and a $40 million termination payment, neither of which happened.ChemImage also alleges that an additional $140 million in incremental development \"milestone\" payments are due.Much of the testimony will involve opposing accounts of why the partnership went south after three years.J&J will present witnesses to show that the contract was terminated for cause, and so ChemImage does not deserve damages. In court papers, they allege that ChemImage failed to meet more than one developmental milestone after more than two years of work, and caused significant cost overruns.\"Plaintiff was harmed as a result of its own conduct,\" J&J's lawyers wrote in January.ChemImage counters in court papers that the delays were caused by issues with Ethicon's own technology, employee turnover, and lack of engagement.Nine current and former J&J executives are on the parties' witness lists, including Hani Abouhalka, the surgery chairman for the MedTech division, and Rocco De Bernardis, the global president of robotic and digital surgery. Peter Shen, the MedTech division's former global head of research, is also on the list.ChemImage is also expected to call many of its own former executives, including its former CEO, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen.Read the original article on Business Insider ChemImage, a small biotech company based in Pittsburgh, is taking the global healthcare company Johnson & Johnson to federal court in Manhattan.AP Photo/Ted ShaffreyJohnson & Johnson executives are scheduled to take the stand in a trial starting Monday.ChemImage, a small biotech firm, sued the healthcare giant over a 2019 partnership that went south.Johnson & Johnson had signed a multibillion-dollar contract with the Pittsburgh-based company.In 2019, Johnson & Johnson, hoping to compete in the growing surgical robotics field, signed a multibillion-dollar contract with a small biotech company called ChemImage.Based in Pittsburgh, ChemImage was pioneering AI-powered software that a surgeon could use in order to \"see\" what a robotic scalpel is doing.

If ChemImage prevails, it could win some $180 million in contract-termination penalties and other overdue payments.ChemImage has also asked the judge to restore all patents and intellectual property it developed under its contract with Johnson & Johnson. This would let the plaintiffs continue using and developing its imaging software.\"This is a case about J&J's decision to retreat from its failed play in surgical robotics, breaking the promises it made to ChemImage to develop its life-saving imaging technology,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"J&J's decision ultimately killed this family-founded company and its technology that could have vastly improved surgical outcomes for millions of people.\"What's undisputed is that two days after Christmas in 2019, ChemImage and the J&J subsidiary Ethicon entered into a 104-page \"Research, Development, License, and Commercialization Agreement.\"The contract set a payment schedule — ChemImage received $7 million up front — and established milestones for future payments and as much as $1.5 billion in eventual royalties.Also undisputed is that in April 2023 — with the effort to meld ChemImage's software and J&J's robotics mired in delay and no commercially viable product in sight — the contract blew up.The judge is tasked with determining whether J&J pulled the contract for good reason — \"with cause.\" If so, ChemImage would be entitled to no damages at all.Alternately, if J&J pulled the contract for no valid reason — without cause — the healthcare company would have been required to give ChemImage a 120-day notice and a $40 million termination payment, neither of which happened.ChemImage also alleges that an additional $140 million in incremental development \"milestone\" payments are due.Much of the testimony will involve opposing accounts of why the partnership went south after three years.J&J will present witnesses to show that the contract was terminated for cause, and so ChemImage does not deserve damages. In court papers, they allege that ChemImage failed to meet more than one developmental milestone after more than two years of work, and caused significant cost overruns.\"Plaintiff was harmed as a result of its own conduct,\" J&J's lawyers wrote in January.ChemImage counters in court papers that the delays were caused by issues with Ethicon's own technology, employee turnover, and lack of engagement.Nine current and former J&J executives are on the parties' witness lists, including Hani Abouhalka, the surgery chairman for the MedTech division, and Rocco De Bernardis, the global president of robotic and digital surgery. Peter Shen, the MedTech division's former global head of research, is also on the list.ChemImage is also expected to call many of its own former executives, including its former CEO, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Courtesy of Merck; Karan Singh for BIPharmaceutical giants such as J&J, Merck, and Eli Lilly are embracing AI and prioritizing upskilling.They hope that training thousands of employees on generative AI will boost productivity in drug development.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.Johnson & Johnson is embracing the concept of a bilingual employee — but not in the classic sense.For the pharmaceutical company, literacy is needed in specialized and core job skills, including research, supply chain, and finance. Then there's fluency in AI technology.\"There are so many ways we've been using AI,\" said Jim Swanson, the chief information officer of J&J. \"But to do that effectively, we had to really create a curriculum and a mindset around upskilling.\"More than 56,000 of J&J's 138,000 workers have taken a generative AI training course, which is required before any employee is authorized to use the technology. After training, J&J's employees can utilize generative AI tools for summarization and prompt engineering, the latter a skill to ask the right question to get the best output from a large language model. A separate, more in-depth digital boot camp that covers topics including AI, augmented reality, and automation has recorded more than 37,000 cumulative hours of training from more than 14,000 employees.Generative AI offers the promise of more quickly identifying compounds for new treatments and vaccines, accelerating drug development, streamlining regulatory compliance, optimizing which patients are best suited for clinical trials, and improving how new drugs are marketed.Deborah Golden, Deloitte's US chief innovation officer, said these advancements were poised to change which skills the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes in recruitment. Biology and chemistry knowledge will still be needed, but it isn't as essential for newer roles like AI engineers, and other new roles might require a mix of traditional expertise and AI know-how if AI-driven drug discovery proliferates.\"When you think about how AI is shifting the balance and the talent requirements, you really need to be able to speak both the language of biology and AI models,\" Golden said.How AI is changing drug developmentGenerative AI could save the pharmaceutical industry tens of billions of dollars each year through improved productivity within drug development.J&J, the maker of treatments like the immunosuppressive drug Stelara and Darzalex, a medication for treating the cancer multiple myeloma, has used more traditional forms of AI for almost a decade. Use cases include AI-enabled software tools that can guide a surgeon through a procedure, speed up drug discovery, and help drug makers manage inventory more effectively.In 2023, J&J piloted a six-week digital immersion program that focused on AI, data science, and other emerging technologies. More than 2,500 employees participated last year, taking 90-minute classes each week, and J&J is planning further expansion this year.Swanson told Business Insider it was critical for company leaders to create a culture that promotes technological literacy. \"We've been around 135 years. We've had to reinvent ourselves multiple times to stay relevant and current,\" he said.The pharmaceutical giant Merck's early generative AI investments included the development of a proprietary platform called GPTeal. Merck — which is responsible for the HPV vaccine Gardasil and the immunotherapy drug Keytruda — said that GPTeal gives employees access to large language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Anthropic's Claude while keeping company data secure from external exposures.Employees are also using generative AI to draft emails and memos and for other productivity-focused tasks, but Merck's aspirations are also getting bolder.\"Now, the journey is clearly to identify, implement, track, and measure use cases that have a dramatic impact on our business,\" said Ron Kim, a senior vice president and the chief technology officer of Merck.Generative AI allows Merck's employees more time to focus on higher-impact tasks. In drug discovery, for example, generative AI can help draft (human-reviewed) regulatory documents that are submitted to health authorities. \"We felt like some of our scientists were taking time being copyeditors,\" Kim said. \"That's not what they trained for.\"Kim said more than 50,000 Merck employees were using GPTeal regularly. The company supported upskilling through a mix of self-serve digital training courses, monthly webcasts focused on generative AI, and boot camps for software developers that could last anywhere from half a day to 10 days.AI can appeal to pharmaceutical companies of various sizesDr. Daniel Stevens, the chief medical officer at Blue Earth Therapeutics, said AI was alluring to the clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company because, as a small startup founded in 2021, it has to be judicious with how it spends capital.\"The application of artificial intelligence is of interest, because it may help us with some of our efficiency goals,\" Stevens said.A $76.5 million Series A in October, which included funding from the healthcare investment firm Soleus Capital and the diagnostic imaging company Bracco Diagnostics, was mostly intended to support clinical trials that will assess the safety and effectiveness of new prostate cancer treatments.Stevens said that with just 20 full-time employees, Blue Earth has not yet needed to offer AI upskill training. He added that when Blue Earth grows its employee base and is ready to offer instruction about the technology, it plans to use online courses and AI certifications from external vendors.Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant behind treatments including the antidepressant Prozac and the type 2 diabetes and weight loss medicine Mounjaro, has used generative AI to support the research of both small and large molecules. The company also used AI to generate documentation for clinical trials and create materials for regulatory submissions.After ChatGPT launched, major employers such as Apple and Amazon restricted employee use of the popular chatbot, with many citing concerns about data privacy. \"We went in the exact opposite direction,\" said Diogo Rau, the chief information and digital officer at Eli Lilly.Rau encouraged Eli Lilly's workforce to embrace the tool without exposing sensitive company information, similar to how an employee might use Google Search.\"We told everybody you need to use it, you need to start bringing ChatGPT into your work,\" said Rau. But, he added, \"Don't put anything in there that you don't want to get out.\"The company also internally sought to bolster interest with an \"AI Games\" competition timed to the Summer Olympics in Paris. Contests involved using a chatbot to write a message to a colleague or relying on generative AI to make a quiz about Eli Lilly's history.In 2024, Eli Lilly also encouraged all employees and managers to use generative AI for their year-end reviews. This year, the company is set to require all senior leaders and managers to obtain an AI certification.\"We've got a workforce that is embracing AI,\" Rau said, adding that employees often stopped him in the office or emailed him to share the ways they were applying AI to their daily work tasks.Read the original article on Business Insider Courtesy of Merck; Karan Singh for BIPharmaceutical giants such as J&J, Merck, and Eli Lilly are embracing AI and prioritizing upskilling.They hope that training thousands of employees on generative AI will boost productivity in drug development.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.Johnson & Johnson is embracing the concept of a bilingual employee — but not in the classic sense.For the pharmaceutical company, literacy is needed in specialized and core job skills, including research, supply chain, and finance.
