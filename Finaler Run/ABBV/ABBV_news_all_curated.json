        "description": "In a new initiative by the AI Structural Biology (AISB) Consortium and powered by Apheris, OpenFold3, a protein structure prediction algorithm developed by the lab of Mohammad AlQuraishi, PhD, will be fine-tuned using proprietary data from AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson in a confidentiality-preserving environment. The post Secure AI Collaboration Will Fine-Tune OpenFold3 with Proprietary Data appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. “Public data is hitting its limit. The real breakthroughs can only happen through increased amounts of data and of course, tapping into industrial data,” so says Robin Roehm, CEO and co-founder of Apheris, a Berlin-based start-up focused on enabling governed, private, and secure access to data for machine learning. In a new initiative by the AI Structural Biology (AISB) Consortium and powered by Apheris, OpenFold3, a protein structure prediction algorithm developed by the lab of Mohammed AlQuraishi, PhD, assistant professor of systems biology at Columbia University, will be fine-tuned using proprietary data from AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson in a confidentiality-preserving environment. The collaboration will evaluate and refine OpenFold3 for predicting 3D structures of molecule complexes, focusing on small molecule-protein and antibody-antigen interactions for drug discovery. Roehm says the motivation for this initiative was to bring parties together to build a better predictive model for individual commercial use. While access to the newly fine-tuned OpenFold3 will be limited to participants who contribute their proprietary data to the program, Roehm highlights that different forms of data accessibility are impactful for the industry. “A key problem for any party that builds and innovates new model architectures is that they cannot benchmark on proprietary data. The validity for industrial grade research is something that you cannot assess,” Roehm told GEN. “Access to industry data for benchmarking is a huge value add for everyone who builds models.” According to AlQuraishi, an open-source version of OpenFold 3, only trained on publicly available data, will also be available “soon” to the greater scientific community with a highly permissive license for both commercial and non-commercial use. “Through this consortium, we can share data with other pharma partners, exploring the hypothesis that each of our internal data sets will be highly complementary when training AI models,” said John Karanicolas, PhD, head of computational drug discovery at AbbVie. “The result could be transformative in how we advance AI-driven drug discovery to develop better medicines faster.” Getting complex According to Roehm, “Who will build the next protein data bank (PDB)?” has been one of the biggest questions of the AI space. AlphaFold, the AI breakthrough that revolutionized biological research by providing access to virtually all the 200 million protein structures that researchers have identified, was powered by the PDB, the public repository housing over 200,000 entries for experimentally-determined protein and nucleic acid structure data collected by scientists over 50 years. Given that AlphaFold lacked the code and data required to train new models, researchers were unable to investigate AlphaFold’s sensitivity to changes in data composition and model architecture nor create variants of the model to tackle new tasks beyond protein structure prediction. Last year, AlQuraishi’s team published OpenFold as a fast, memory efficient, and trainable implementation of AlphaFold, to address this gap. Notably, the next wave of AI models, such as AlphaFold 3 and AlQuraishi’s OpenFold3, have moved toward understanding protein-ligand interactions, a focus area crucial for drug discovery yet particularly sparse in public databases. “We expect that by training on proprietary data, the model will become more capable on hard problems that AlphaFold 3-based models struggle with, such as predicting protein-small molecule complexes. This is especially likely because the availability of such data is limited in the PDB, and often excludes small molecule drugs that are of most practical interest,” AlQuraishi told GEN. Given the impact of public repositories, such as the PDB, Roehm said the industry generally “wishes for more open access to models and data.” However, expecting large-scale pharma companies to publicly release their assets may not be realistic. To maintain data confidentiality between parties, the AISB Consortium initiative leverages a federated architecture, which trains the model within individual environments for each pharma company, and then aggregates the results to a global model in a way that the underlying data cannot be reverse engineered. The program also implements data quality assessments to support fair commercial value exchange for participating parties. Although leveraging industrial data is argued to be a “game changer,” most proprietary assets remain under lock and key. Time will tell whether evolving data collaboration efforts will impactfully push forward the next generation of AI breakthroughs.

        "description": "A study in rats found that maternal infections during pregnancy can have lasting effects on offspring brain function that may underlie an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, and may point to therapeutic interventions targeting hippocampal function. The post Uncovering the Effects of Maternal Infections on Brain Function in Newborn Rat Offspring appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. Scientists at the Slovak Academy of Sciences reported what they claim is compelling evidence that maternal infections during pregnancy can have lasting effects on offspring brain function. The team investigated the impact of maternal immune activation (MIA) on hippocampal pyramidal neurons in newborn rat offspring and found that prenatal inflammation significantly impaired neuronal excitability. These changes in brain function may underlie the increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with maternal infections. “Maternal infections are a known risk factor for conditions like autism, schizophrenia, and depression,” said Eliyahu Dremencov, PhD, corresponding author of the team’s published study in Brain Medicine. “Our research shows that early-life alterations in hippocampal neuron function could be a key mechanism linking prenatal inflammation to these disorders.” Dremencov and colleagues described their findings in a report titled, “Maternal immune activation impairs hippocampal pyramidal neuron excitability in newborn rat offspring: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders,” in which they concluded, “This study provides novel insights into early neurophysiological changes following prenatal immune challenge that may inform therapeutic interventions targeting hippocampal function.” “Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder,” the authors wrote. Infection during pregnancy triggers an immune response that releases cytokines—chemical messengers that can cross the placenta and impact fetal brain development. “An acute infectious illness increases blood concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones, such as corticosteroids,” they continued. “These factors can pass the placenta, as well as the blood–brain barrier, and affect embryonal neurodevelopment.” The hippocampus plays a critical role in these disorders, the team further noted, but the impact of maternal immune activation (MIA) on early hippocampal neuronal function isn’t well understood. For their newly reported study the investigators set out to test the hypothesis that, in rats, MIA leads to impaired functioning of hippocampal pyramidal neurons isolated from newborn offspring. Using a well-established animal model, Dremencov and colleagues induced MIA in pregnant rats using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial component that stimulates the immune system. They then examined the hippocampal neurons of newborn offspring to assess how such prenatal immune activation affected neuronal excitability​. “Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the hippocampi of newborn rats and maintained for 13 days in vitro (DIV13),” the team explained. “Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings assessed neuronal excitability parameters between DIV4-13.” The study’s electrophysiological analyses revealed several major changes in hippocampal neuron function in newborns exposed to MIA. These included increased threshold potential, meaning that neurons required a stronger stimulus to activate, suggesting impaired excitability. The newborn hippocampal neurons also exhibited delayed action potential latency, taking longer to respond to stimulation, which affects signal transmission. In addition, they exhibited reduced peak potential and firing rates indicating lower neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, there were sex-specific effects of MIA. Male offspring showed a greater reduction in spontaneous neuronal activity, which may have implications for the higher prevalence of certain neurodevelopmental disorders in males​, the researchers suggested. “We observed that neurons from MIA-exposed offspring had a significantly higher threshold for activation, slower response times, and reduced firing rates,” noted lead author Lucia Moravcikova, PhD. “This suggests a disruption in glutamatergic neurotransmission, which plays a critical role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation … One of the most striking aspects of our findings is the sex-specific vulnerability to prenatal inflammation. This could help explain why conditions like autism and schizophrenia are more commonly diagnosed in males.” The authors further noted, “These alterations suggest impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus of MIA offspring, with potential sex-specific effects observed for spontaneous activity … This reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with maternal infection during pregnancy.” The hippocampus is a crucial brain region involved in memory, emotion, and cognition, and its dysfunction has been implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The study’s results support the hypothesis that prenatal immune challenges can disrupt early brain wiring, leading to long-term cognitive and behavioral impairments. “Our findings align with human epidemiological studies linking maternal infection to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders,” said Dremencov. “Understanding how prenatal inflammation alters brain function could open the door to new preventative or therapeutic approaches.” With growing evidence that prenatal inflammation affects brain function, researchers are now exploring strategies to mitigate these effects. Potential interventions might include the use of anti-inflammatory treatments during pregnancy to reduce excessive immune responses, or neuroprotective therapies that target disrupted neurotransmitter pathways to restore normal brain function. “It is known that children of women suffering from an infectious disease during pregnancy have a higher risk of future development of depression, schizophrenia, and autism,” the authors concluded. “The results of the present study suggest that the early postnatal suppression of the excitability of hippocampal neurons might underline these epidemiological observations.” Early-life interventions using techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may enhance neuronal excitability and connectivity​. “If we can identify ways to prevent or reverse these changes in early development, we may be able to reduce the long-term burden of neurodevelopmental disorders,” said Dremencov. The authors further pointed out, “However, the risks and benefits of these interventions must be very carefully assessed … Animal models can be used in these assessments; however, the limitation of these models, which results from the difference between rodents and human brains, must be considered.” Questions do remain, the authors acknowledged, including how the newly reported findings may translate to human brain development, and whether there is a specific time window during pregnancy when interventions might be most effective.
