        "description": "Investors interested in the AI trade beyond the Magnificent Seven should look into these four stocks with breakout growth potential. BofA is bullish on a handful of under-the-radar names set to benefit from the AI boom. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesBank of America sees additional AI investing opportunities in small and mid-cap stocks.AI mentions on earnings calls have increased, especially among Russell 2000 companies.The bank shared four buy-rated AI stock picks that go beyond the Magnificent Seven.The Magnificent Seven and the AI trade have become synonymous, but there are opportunities for investors to get exposure to the AI mega-trend outside of the biggest names in the market.Small and mid-cap companies are adopting AI technology to drive earnings growth, according to Bank of America analysts. As the AI trade progresses, the next wave of beneficiaries will be companies that adopt AI into their product offerings and revenue models.While AI infrastructure companies like Nvidia benefit from size and scale, more small-cap companies are participating in the next leg of the AI trade. Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America, wrote in a recent report that earnings calls of Russell 2000 companies have mentioned AI more frequently over the last few quarters.Software companies are particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the nascent trend of agentic AI, or AI systems that operate autonomously with limited human supervision, according to the bank. Senior technology research analyst Brad Sills reported increased signs of \"green shoots\" in the development of agentic application adoption at the bank's Global Technology Conference earlier this month. Examples include increased database activity to handle running AI applications and more AI-focused code.Small-cap companies in particular present AI opportunity for active stock pickers. While the overall category has lagged behind its large-cap counterpart, the current backdrop allows investors to buy up promising high-growth companies at a discounted price. Additionally, Hall sees the potential for easing inflation and a pick-up in M&A transaction volume to provide a boost to small-cap technology valuations.Below are Bank of America's four top buy-rated small and mid-cap AI picks, along with their 12-month price targets and relevant analyst commentary.DatadogMarkets InsiderTicker: DDOGMarket cap: $42.1 billionPrice target: $138Company description: Datadog provides cloud-based tools that help tech teams monitor application performance and infrastructure in real time.BofA commentary: \"We believe Datadog is a share gainer in the generative AI theme, as AI-native companies are already driving 8.5% of its annual recurring revenue (ARR). As more AI-native companies scale, and non-AI native organizations release their own AI experiences, we believe Datadog stands to benefit. We believe Datadog has the potential to deliver durable 20%+ revenue growth and attractive 20%+ free cash flow margins over the coming year.\"Seagate TechnologyMarkets InsiderTicker: STXMarket cap: $27.8 billionPrice target: $135Company description: Seagate designs and manufactures data storage products, including hard drives and SSDs, for consumer and enterprise use.BofA commentary: \"Seagate's HAMR ramp has begun after announcing the 2nd & 3rd hyperscaler qualifications at the May 2025 Analyst Day (1st qual. was December 2024). The company has already achieved record margins coming out of the 2023 HDD downcycle and we believe the HAMR ramp in C2H25 will propel margins higher.\"Kyndryl HoldingsMarkets InsiderTicker: KDMarket cap: $9.3 billionPrice target: $44Company description: Kyndryl, spun off from IBM, is an IT services company that provides infrastructure services including cloud, data center, and network modernization to enterprises around the world.BofA commentary: \"We continue to view Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Generative AI (GenAI) as a net tailwind for the [IT services industry] … Recent large deal signings at attractive high-single-digit pre-tax-income margins provide incremental visibility into out-year earnings power.\"JFrogMarkets InsiderTicker: FROGMarket cap: $4.8 billionPrice target: $48Company description: JFrog offers a DevOps platform known for its artifact repository manager, Artifactory, which streamlines software development by enabling continuous integration and delivery across the software release lifecycle.BofA commentary: \"Increasing binaries from AI-related packages (Docker, Hugging Face, Python, etc.) are driving increasing usage of the platform.

        "description": "Investors surveyed by BofA see a global recession triggered by the trade war as the largest tail risk to markets for the third month in a row. Most global investors believe that international stocks will outperform US stocks over the next five years, according to Bank of America's latest fund manager survey.TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesMost investors think the US stock market will underperform global stocks over the next five years54% of fund managers believe international stocks will be the top-performing asset, BofA's latest survey found.Investors see a global recession triggered by tariffs as the largest tail risk for markets.Investors see years of US stock outperformance coming to an end, with most respondents in a survey from Bank of America eyeing international stocks as the top performer in the coming years. Global fund managers surveyed by the bank indicated they felt more optimistic about international stocks than US equities this month. More than half of investors—54%—surveyed from June 6 to June 12 said they believe international equities would be the best-performing asset over the next five years, BofA strategists wrote on Tuesday.Less than a quarter of surveyed fund managers said they believed US stocks would be the best-performing asset over the next five years.BofA Global Fund Manager Survey/BofA Global ResearchThat compares to just 23% of investors who think US stocks will be the best-performing asset, and a combined 18% of investors who believed the best-performing asset would be either gold, government bonds, or corporate bonds.The pessimism hanging over US markets appears to stem from President Donald Trump's trade war and concerns about the effects of tariffs on the global economy.47% of fund managers said they believe a trade war triggering a global recession was the largest \"tail risk\" to markets. A worldwide recession has been the largest perceived tail risk to markets for three months in a row.Nearly half of fund managers saw a trade war triggering a global recession as the largest tail risk to markets.BofA Global Fund Manager Survey/BofA Global ResearchOther prominent tail risks investors were eying this month include the Fed hiking interest rates to combat inflation, or a credit event triggered by the \"disorderly\" rise in bond yields, the bank said.Still, strategists said that investor sentiment had picked up in Bank of America's June survey compared to recent months, and the mood has recovered back to pre-Liberation Day levels. A sentiment gauge that tracks investors' growth expectations, cash level, and allocation to stocks also rose to 5.4 in June, the gauge's highest level since before Trump's April 2 tariff unveiling.\"Investor sentiment back to pre-Liberation Day 'Goldilocks bull' levels, but not worrying bullish,\" strategists wrote.Investor sentiment rose to its highest level in 3 months in BofA's June fund manager survey.BofA Global Fund Manager Survey/BofA Global Research66% of surveyed investors also said they believe the global economy would avoid a recession and secure a soft landing over the next 12 months, up from 37% of investors who felt that way in BofA's April survey.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Bank of America flagged reduced holdings of US Treasurys among foreign investors as a troubling trend for the bond market. US Treasury Department.Patrick Semansky/APForeign investors are reducing US Treasury holdings, signaling future bond volatility, BofA said.Foreign demand for Treasurys is atypically low despite a weaker US dollar and .Concerns over US debt and tariffs are driving investors to diversify away from US assets.Foreign buyers of US Treasurys have been shedding their holdings, raising the possibility of more future turbulence for US government bonds, Bank of America titled said. In a report on Monday titled \"Foreign UST Demand Shows Cracks,\" the bank said that foreign investors, often central banks, are purchasing fewer Treasurys. Megan Swiber, rates strategist at Bank of America, wrote on Monday that US dollar asset holdings have declined over $60 billion since the beginning of April. Foreign participation in the most recent US 20-year Treasury auction was the lowest since July 2020.\"The foreign demand trajectory going forward is concerning, especially in light of more global investors looking to reduce US assets or increase hedge ratios,\" she wrote.Specifically, custodial holdings, or US Treasurys that foreign central banks hold at the Federal Reserve, dropped by $17 billion in the last week and are down $48 billion from late March.The Fed is also conducting fewer reverse repurchase agreements, which could point to lower demand for Treasurys among global central banks. A reverse repurchase agreement allows institutions to lend cash overnight to the Fed in exchange for high-quality collateral, usually in the form of short-term US government bonds. Reverse repurchase agreement balances have declined $15 billion since late March, according to the bank.As seen in the chart below, demand for Treasurys in Q1 of 2025 primarily came from broker-dealers and foreign investors, a trend that may now be reversing. Bank of AmericaDecreased foreign demand is atypical in times of heightened economic uncertainty and a weak dollar. Usually, central banks buy up US government debt when the dollar falls versus rivals — which has been the case this year with the US dollar index down over 9%. Additionally, historically low interest rates in other parts of the world have led foreign investors to jump into the US Treasury market in pursuit of higher yields, Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist said recently. As a result, foreign investors have accumulated record-high exposure to US government bonds with a maturity of over 10 years, meaning that any adjustments they make to their holdings will have an outsize impact on the bond market. ApolloBofA said that it appears now that foreign investors are cutting back on their US Treasury investments, as deficit concerns and general growth worries stemming from tariffs and the tax bill hurt their appeal as safe-haven assets.

An optimal payment experience, which is frictionless in nature, involves collaboration. [contact-form-7] Issuers and merchants must work together to ensure that the merchant makes the sale, and the issuers want their cards to be top of wallet. Amy Pierce, managing director of merchant engagement at Bank of America, told PYMNTS that to get to that optimal state, data sharing must take place and collaborators must be aware that the payments are themselves shifting. “We’re seeing a rise, of course, in card-not-present (CNP) transactions and a significant increase in eCommerce … at Bank of America, we’re seeing a 7.5% increase in debit CNP volume year over year,” she said. Against that backdrop, merchants queried by the bank said approvals and declines were top of mind for their businesses, Pierce told PYMNTS. In the meantime, the data that’s so essential for a smooth payments experience remains siloed. Merchants have information on customers, issuers have other data, and digital wallet providers have still other tidbits of insight — all of which, when taken together, allow issuers to make better authorization decisions by reducing false positive declines, she said. Technology has a role to play in data sharing. Trusted merchant IDs (MIDs for short) allow merchants to segment their volume and route trusted transactions through a dedicated MID. The Trusted IDs tell issuers that the merchant has a relationship in place with the customer — and that transactions have a higher likelihood of being valid, which reduces false positive declines, she said. Other solutions include issuers’ use of APIs, where merchants as well as acquirers/processors send data that is ingested into authorization platforms. This additional data can be used by the issuer to make a more informed authorization decision. That same data can be used to aid in claims investigations should the need arise, Pierce said. A simple form of data sharing includes credentials on file that further optimize the payments experience, as merchants store the card number for future purchases. This helps the checkout experience to be frictionless, Pierce said, adding that industry solutions such as card account updater and tokenization make it possible to keep the credential on file current. This helps maintain customer relationships and uninterrupted commerce (especially with subscriptions and recurring transactions). If a card on file is lost or stolen, for example, by using card account updater or tokenization the merchant can obtain the new card number and process the transaction on the new credential. It is also important for merchants to include the credential-on-file indicator, which informs the issuer that the merchant stored the card and advises that the cardholder has a history with the merchant. “When that transaction comes to us as an issuer, we know what the relationship is between the customer and the merchant, and we can decision it appropriately,” Pierce said. Security is top of mind for everybody. PYMNTS asked Pierce about the state of 3DS 2.0 and 3DS Data Only. Although 2.0 has yet to truly “take off in the U.S.,” Pierce said, it is being used by merchants for large-ticket items or if that merchant has been experiencing relatively higher levels of fraud. Consumers in the United States are getting used to validating transactions with a text or multifactor authentication (MFA). From an issuer perspective, we need to balance introducing friction into the checkout process with the enhanced security received from an authenticated transaction, she said. With Data Only, the merchant, through the ACS provider, sends more information to the issuer (in this case, Bank of America) that is used to sharpen decision making, she said. No matter where or when the transaction is occurring, data and collaboration are used in pursuit of a common goal. “We want to reduce those false positive declines and create the best experience for our mutual customers,” Pierce said.

Six weeks after The Clearing House raised the transaction limit on real-time payments from $1 million to $10 million Feb. 9, transactions over $1 million accounted for 52% of the value of all U.S. real-time payments processed on the RTP® network by Bank of America. [contact-form-7] The bank’s clients have embraced the new, higher limit to enable new use cases in B2B payments, Bank of America said in a Tuesday (June 10) press release provided to PYMNTS. “Our clients have been using RTP to pay vendors, employees and customers, but the larger cap has opened up use cases for different kinds of transactions, such as real estate and deal closings and other corporate activity,” AJ McCray, head of global payment products, Global Payment Solutions (GPS) at Bank of America said in the release. Bank of America, which is one of the owners of The Clearing House, is one of the first financial institutions to enable corporate clients to send payments up to the new $10 million transaction limit, according to the release. With the RTP network, payments are settled immediately, the payment’s originator can see the status of the transaction, the recipient receives the payment within seconds, and, because RTP uses the ISO 20022 standard for financial messaging, the originator can include detailed remittance information with the payment, the release said. The network operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, per the release. Other potential use cases for the RTP network include just-in-time supplier payments, complete real estate transactions and account-to-account money movement, the release said. “The instant nature of real-time payments is a huge advantage for optimizing working capital and cash flow,” Jay Davenport, co-head of GPS global corporate sales at Bank of America, said in the release. “RTP payments embody some of the most commonly requested features from our customers — convenience, transparency and resiliency.” Faster payments seek to offer immediacy, transparency and availability of funds that solve real-world frictions, Irfan Ahmad, managing director and head of U.S. payments in GPS at Bank of America, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in May. “[N]o other payment rail allows you to see within a few seconds whether or not that payment was successful,” Ahmad said. “…There’s a huge benefit in that, whether you’re a consumer or a business.” The Clearing House raised the transaction limit to $10 million Feb. 9, saying the change allows the real-time payment network to provide “a seamless alternative to traditional wire transfers and checks while improving liquidity management in today’s fast-paced economy.” Over 285,000 businesses use the RTP rail monthly, a testament to the growing corporate demand for instant payments, according to the April edition of the PYMNTS Intelligence and The Clearing House collaboration, “The Real-Time Payments World Map.” For all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.

        "description": "Things have been good for stocks over the last two months. Maybe too good, according to a new report from Bank of America. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonGlobal stocks are nearing sell signals as inflows rise to near-record levels, BofA says.The S&P 500 and Vanguard's Total World Stock Index are up 20% since April 8.But concerns around inflation, the labor market, and the US national debt persist.Things have been good for stocks over the last two months. Maybe too good, according to a new report from Bank of America.Since its most recent low on April 8, the S&P 500 and Vanguard's Total World Stock Index are up 20% as investors have piled into the market at a near-record pace. On an annualized basis, 2025 has seen the second-highest inflows into global stocks ever, trailing only 2024, BofA's Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett said in a client note Friday. For US stocks, it's the third-highest year ever, after 2024 and 2021.Bank of AmericaYet, amid the bullish frenzy, Hartnett said global stocks are approaching two sell signals.The first is the amount of money flowing into global stock funds. If they hit 1% of their current assets under management within a four-week span, the sell signal is activated. Over the last four weeks, flows totaled 0.9% of the funds' AUM. To hit 1%, flows would have to hit $30 billion in the \"coming weeks,\" Hartnett said.The second is a breadth indicator that says when 88% of the ACWI countries' indexes trade above both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, it's a sign that things are frothy and investors should sell, Hartnett said. Currently, 84% of ACWI countries' indexes are higher than their moving averages, meaning the market is in \"overbought territory,\" Hartnett said.Both of Hartnett's sell indicators are in line with the conventional wisdom of contrarian investing espoused by legends like Warren Buffett. When the market is overwhelmingly bullish, good news is already priced in. When investors are bearish, it's an opportunity to buy stocks at a discount, the thinking goes.But sentiment gauges have sent mixed signals over the last couple of months. While inflows are strong, the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey shows investors are still net bearish. Bank of America's own Bull/Bear indicator shows the market's aggregate attitude hovers somewhere between optimism and pessimism, with a slight tilt toward the former.Breadth indicators are broadly in line with Hartnett's measure. Stocks of all stripes are doing well.Like Hartnett, Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a May 27 report that the robust breadth levels could be a cause for concern in the near-term.\"Early-April setup was ripe for rally on good news given washed out sentiment/breadth and deeply oversold market,\" she wrote in a note co-authored with Kevin Gordon, a senior strategist at Schwab. \"Setup now is not at opposite extreme.\"While breadth and sentiment can be contrarian indicators, it should be noted that the momentum factor has been king over the last decade and a half. What has done well (mega-cap tech stocks and popular indexes) has continued to do well, and steep declines in the broader market have generally been short-lived. That could still be the case going forward.Beyond technical indicators, investors are also monitoring fundamental measures of the economy's health. The macroeconomic picture remains unclear as business owners and consumers digest President Trump's tariffs. Concerns persist about how the import taxes will affect consumer prices and growth.The US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, more than economists expected, but the number wasn't a sure sign that the labor market remains solid, as April and March data were revised down.Long-term Treasury yields also continue to rise as Trump's tax bill fuels investor concerns around inflation and the US budget deficit.A negative catalyst in the form of rising unemployment or higher inflation could spark a reversal in the ultra-bullish signals Hartnett is watching.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "A sector once viewed as a classic Trump trade has been left behind by investors this year, but there are several reasons it could soon rally, BofA said. Jason Kozlowski / EyeEmEnergy stocks have lost their appeal among fund managers despite Trump's push for more drilling.Large investors have reduced energy exposure following poor sector performance in Trump's first term.Bank of America upgraded its energy sector rating, citing strong cash flow and inflation resilience.A part of the market once considered a classic \"Trump trade\" has been left behind by investors, but they might want to reconsider, Bank of America said. Enthusiasm for energy stocks has fizzled out among big investors, despite the president's mantra of \"drill, baby, drill.\" According to Bank of America, large-cap active mutual funds have reduced their energy holdings the most out of any sector in the past three months, and hedge funds are shorting energy more than any other S&P 500 sector. The downbeat views on energy follow a lackluster performance during Trump's first term. However, while institutional players flee the space, Bank of America sees an opportunity. The bank still sees plenty of upside and upgraded its rating to overweight in a note last month. It's not just the fact that institutional buyers may be nearing capitulation, though. Energy is a top performer in times of inflation and stagflation, thanks to the sector's focus on cash dividends. Bank of America pointed to the sector's strong free cash flow generation as a sign that energy stocks are in good shape and can provide income to investors in times of rising prices.The sector is also well insulated from tariffs compared to other parts of the market, as Bank of America believes energy companies would be largely exempt from protectionist trade policies. Historically, the energy sector has been sensitive to oil prices, which could be a concern crude remains stuck in a rut. But since 2016, the energy sector's sensitivity to oil has dropped by a third, which Bank of America attributes to the sector's focus on distributing dividends. That means the sector will be shielded in a stagflationary scenario with lower growth and energy prices.\"If stagflation is the base case, Energy is more likely to outperform than underperform,\" Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy at the bank, wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "A combo of lower taxes, lower tariffs, and lower rates could create a new bubble in markets, BofA's Michael Hartnett said. Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's policies risk fueling a bubble in parts of the market, BofA said Friday.The firm cites the combination of lower taxes, lower tariffs, and lower rates being pursued by the White House.BofA says the policies could incentivize a pronounced rotation out of bonds into crypto and AI.Bank of America said on Friday that a policy trifecta of lower taxes, lower tariffs, and lower interest rates could fuel a new speculative bubble in markets.The prediction comes as Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which would lower taxes among other fiscal measures, sits with the Senate after passing the House of Representatives last week. Meanwhile, Trump continues to pursue trade deals and has ramped up calls for the Fed to lower interest rates.BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that policy could fuel a \"deeper\" rotation out of bonds and into a handful of areas of the stock market — most notably AI and the high-flying tech names that make up the Magnificent Seven — as well as crypto.Hartnett flagged the relationship between the stock and bond markets as a telltale sign of a bubble forming. An inversion of the classic \"bonds master, stocks servant\" dynamic has been a mark of past speculative frenzies, with this kind of market behavior seen in 12 of the last 14 bubbles, he noted.The 30-year Treasury touched the highest level since 2008 last week as markets tumbled over fears about the GOP budget bill adding to the US deficit.\"Nothing screams bubble more than equities driving nominal/real yields higher,\" Hartnett wrote.The analysts added that based on past market manias, the Magnificent Seven could see a fresh gain of 30% before the group peaks.The speculation mentioned by Hartnett may already be underway, with so-called low-quality stocks outperforming the broader market over the past few weeks. This dynamic was first pointed out by Bloomberg in a story published Thursday.Illustrating this dynamic, a basket of low-quality stocks compiled by UBS — which counts meme stocks like GameStop and AMC among its components — has handily beaten the S&P 500 since its recent bottom on April 8.Crypto has also seen gains in recent weeks, highlighting the speculative, risk-on mood that's returned as investors work past the tariff chaos that sparked April's big sell-off. Bitcoin is trading at fresh records, hitting an all-time high above $112,000 last week.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Automation company ABB is reportedly preparing a possible deal for its robotics unit. The company is working with Bank of America and UBS on a spinoff or sale of the robotics business, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday (May 27), citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the report, ABB had said last month it aims to spin off the robotics unit in the second quarter of next year, as CEO Morten Wierod shifts the company’s focus to more profitable parts of the business. Among them is electrification, thanks to the rise of new data centers being built to meet artificial intelligence (AI) demand. The report added that the company could also consider selling the unit, which could be worth upwards of $3.5 billion, rather than spinning it off. Bloomberg notes that ABB’s robotics unit accounts for roughly two-thirds of the company’s robotics and discrete automation division. It employs 7,000 people, with manufacturing hubs in China, the U.S. and Sweden, where ABB’s robotics business was launched. PYMNTS examined the rise of robotics in the workplace earlier this year after Figure, an OpenAI-backed robotics AI startup, showcased humanoid robots that can understand voice commands and can grab objects they hadn’t seen before. Jenny Shern, general manager at robot builder NexCOBOT, told PYMNTS at the time that humanoid robots face more complicated challenges than industrial robots. “Traditional industrial robotic arms with vision systems primarily rely on preprogrammed instructions to execute tasks. This works well in factory environments where applications are repetitive and goal-oriented,” she told PYMNTS. However, “implementing humanoid robots into household settings is a more complex advancement because, unlike factories, household environments are highly dynamic, and tasks will vary significantly from one home to another,” Shern said. In unpredictable environments, humanoid robots need AI to operate effectively in daily life because preprogrammed instructions won’t be sufficient, she added. Rodney Brooks, co-founder and CTO of Robust AI, said Figure’s robot demo illustrated just how superior humans are to machines when it comes to picking up objects. “The human effortlessly reached into the paper bag, extracting each item one by one — often with only the slightest glimpse of each — then laid them out neatly on a pristine countertop,” Brooks told PYMNTS. “In contrast, the humanoid robots picked up the objects at a snail’s pace, about 10 to 20 times slower, despite having a clear, unobstructed view of them.” The post ABB Reportedly Exploring $3.5 Billion Sale of Robotics Business appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "As stablecoin adoption accelerates, investors should brace for a potentially steeper yield curve and boosted T-bill supply. Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesStablecoin adoption could boost demand for short-dated Treasury bills, Bank of America says.Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currency and backed by reserves of liquid assets like T-bills. Heightened issiance of Treasurys could steepen the yield curve, BofA wrote.With US stablecoin legislation winding its way through Congress, investors should be aware of possible disruptions to the Treasury market stemming from the growing corner of the crypto sector. Bank of America analysts said this week that accelerated stablecoin adoption is bound to inject demand for short-dated Treasurys, shaking up the US bond prices and volatility.\"For each $1 that leaves traditional banks in favor of stablecoins, there will be a $0.90 incremental demand for USTs,\" the bank wrote on Tuesday.That's because stablecoins, a kind of crypto that's meant to hold a stable value pegged to a fiat currency, are backed by reserves of liquid assets like Treasurys. Tether — the world's largest stablecoin — held $98 billion worth of Treasury bills in its reserve assets as of March.As Congress irons out a regulatory framework for stablecoins, current proposals would require the token to hold reserves in cash, cash equivalents, or T-bills that mature in less than three months, Bank of America wrote.Crypto bulls have long expected a wave of stablecoin adoption if US banks are provided clear regulation on how to handle these assets. All eyes are now on the so-called Genius Act, which recently moved forward in the Senate. Such developments have prompted upbeat takes from White House, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week saying that stablecoins could trigger $2 trillion in T-bill demand: \"We are going big on digital assets.\"But going big could be disruptive for Treasury holders, Bank of America noted.\"Due to the strict reserve requirements imposed on stablecoin issuers, the U.S. Treasury would likely issue T-bills at greater levels leading to a steeper yield curve,\" the note said.Rising Treasury yields have already been a disruptive force in the stock market this year, but the yield curve's impact could be limited if the Treasury Department lowers the weighted-average maturities, helping meet shifting supply and demand dynamics.Beyond the bond market, BofA warned that increased stablecoin adoption could eventually pose a risk to bank deposits, pushing value creation outside of the bank sector.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Each week, the evolution of the ongoing cryptocurrency-FinTech convergence seems to get another headline to hang its hat on. Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin. This week, it is the news Tuesday (May 27) that Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Circle is hoping for a valuation of $5.65 billion with an offering price target of $24 to $26 per share. The lead underwriters are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle’s pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments. Circle’s goal for its IPO is to position itself favorably to become the financial utility layer of the internet. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) for money movement or a SWIFT network reimagined for digital assets. To get there, Circle may need to evolve beyond being a stablecoin issuer. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost. See also: Keeping Stablecoins Stable is Complicated: Why CFOs Need to Pay Attention Stablecoin Competition Is Getting Crowded The stablecoin arena is no longer the wild frontier it once was. Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. Tether remains the volume leader globally, especially outside the United States. Circle’s edge lies in its U.S.-compliant stance and focus on transparency and fiat backing. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises. Circle’s S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. In 2024, the company earned $1.68 billion in total revenue, with 99% of that coming from interest income on reserves backing USDC. That figure underscores how tightly Circle’s fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy. As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle’s revenue. According to its filing, a 1% drop in rates could slash income by as much as $441 million. Stablecoins have started to decouple themselves from crypto exchanges and position themselves as a component of real-world financial infrastructure, PYMNTS reported in March. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April. Read also: Smaller Banks Face Urgent Crypto Decisions Regulation Remains Crypto’s Looming Wildcard Circle’s IPO plans can also be seen as a part of a broader movement among other major crypto firms seeking to capitalize on a more pro-crypto, pro-business regulatory climate under the President Donald Trump administration. The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, the country’s first stablecoin legislation, is proceeding through the Senate amid recognition in Washington that stablecoins are too big to ignore. Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. The Circle S-1 flags multiple legal risks, but chief among them is the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins. To diversify its business model, Circle this month brought the Circle Payments Network (CPN) live. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains. Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico.

Bank of America analysts this week even called Google's slew of new AI announcements a \"Trojan horse\" for its device business.For years, Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out. Apple leads in the US in phone sales, though it still trails Android globally. The two have also gradually converged; iOS has become more customizable, while Android has become cleaner and easier to use. As hardware upgrades have slowed in recent years, the focus has shifted to the smarts inside the device.That could be a big problem for Apple.

Right now, it's still behind Google and OpenAI, and that gap continues to widen.During Google's I/O conference this week, the search giant bombarded us with new AI features. Perhaps the best example was a particularly grabby demo of Google's \"Project Astra\" assistant helping someone fix their bike by searching through the bike manual, pulling up a YouTube video, and calling a bike shop to see if certain supplies were in stock.It was, of course, a highly polished promotional video, but it made Siri look generations behind.\"It has long been the case that the best way to bring products to the consumer market is via devices, and that seems truer than ever,\" wrote Ben Thompson, analyst and Stratechery author, in an I/O dispatch this week.\"Android is probably going to be the most important canvas for shipping a lot of these capabilities,\" he added.Google's golden opportunityApple has done a good job of locking users into its ecosystem with iMessage blue bubbles, features like FaceTime, and peripherals like the Apple Watch that require an iPhone to use.Google's Pixel phone line, meanwhile, remains a rounding error when compared to global smartphone shipments. That's less of a problem when Google has huge partners like Samsung that bring all of its AI features to billions of Android users globally.While iPhone users will get some of these new features through Google's iOS apps, it's clear that the \"universal assistant\" the company is building will only see its full potential on Android. Perhaps this could finally get iOS users to make the switch.\"We're seeing diminishing returns on a hardware upgrade cycle, which means we're now really focused on the software upgrade cycle,\" Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Business Insider.Without major changes by Apple, Shmulik said he sees the gap in capabilities between Android and iOS only widening.\"If it widens to the point where someone with an iPhone says, 'Well my phone can't do that,' does it finally cause that switching event from what everyone has always considered this incredible lock-in from Apple?\" Shmulik said.Beyond smartphonesInternally, Google has been preparing for this moment.The company merged its Pixel, Chrome, and Android teams last year to capitalize on the AI opportunity.\"We are going to be very fast-moving to not miss this opportunity,\" Google's Android chief Sameer Samat told BI at last year's I/O. \"It's a once-in-a-generation moment to reinvent what phones can do.

So, if Google decides to double down on its Pixel phones at the expense of its partners, it could step into a business land mine.Of course, Google needs to think about more than smartphones. Its renewed bet on XR glasses is a bet on what might be the next-generation computing platform.

Now it's poised to get ahead by leveraging its AI chops, and Apple might give it the exact opening it's waited more than a decade for.\"I don't know about an open goal,\" said Shmulik of Apple, \"but it does feel like they've earned themselves a penalty kick.\"Have something to share?

        "description": "The S&P 500 recently flashed a technical sell signal, Bank of America said, which can suggest a near-term drop in stock prices. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe stock market may be headed for a fresh pullback, Bank of America said.Analysts said the dip in stocks should be bought, as the market is still in a broader uptrend.Stocks have slipped in recent days amid fears about the US fiscal situation. The stock market is flashing signs that another buying opportunity could be on the way, according to Bank of America.Analysts at the bank said they believed the S&P 500 was slightly overbought and due for another pullback in the near term. Rather than fretting over a potential sell-off, investors should buy that dip, the bank said, adding that it believes the market is still in an overall uptrend.The S&P 500 recently flashed a TD Combo sell signal on May 16. It's a technical indicator that can suggest a near-term drop in stock prices.The S&P 500's relative strength index — a gauge that determines the momentum of the market — also suggests that a stock pullback is due, the BofA analysts wrote on Wednesday.\"The S&P 500 isn't moody, just a little overbought and wary of rates. Dip due, buy it,\" the analysts said.The bank estimated that the lowest support level it sees for stocks was around 5,580. That price implies the benchmark index falling around 5% from its current level.On the upside, analysts said that they saw the benchmark index rising to around 6,000 to retest its all-time highs, though it's possible it climbs as hight as 6,266 in the near term.There are a few reasons the market could rise, according to the bank:For one, stocks look like they're following a trajectory similar to 2015-2018. In those years, which also closely followed a presidential election, stocks rallied around 7% before peaking.In 2018, the S&P 500 fell around 10% from its postelection peak. This year, the index has seen a steeper 20% from its postelection top.\"Should this repeat in 2025, that equates to the SPX reaching 6,266 this summer. As Newton's third law of motion suggests, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,\" the bank said.Second, breadth, or a measure of the number of winning stocks relative to the number of losing stocks, is improving. The number of stocks above the S&P 500's 200-day simple moving average has climbed above 50%.The S&P 500 is up for the month, reflecting a red-hot rally that clawed back the benchmark index's losses since the start of the year. But the index is down more than 1% from last Friday, when Moody's downgrade of the US debt rating stoked more concern about the yawning budget deficit.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Business-to-business (B2B) transactions typically involve higher volumes and more complex authorization than consumer payments. Companies must balance usability with security, often managing multiple layers of authentication for different roles, departments and systems. Still, look closely at the latest generation of B2B payment systems and you’ll find an unexpected hero emerging from consumer tech: the humble QR code. “When we built QR sign-in, it was in response to a pain point our clients were experiencing,” Jennifer Sanctis, managing director, CashPro at Bank of America, told PYMNTS. Less than two years after its 2022 launch, the B2B authentication tool has been used more than 2 million times, and its adoption is up 60% in the past year alone. But when Bank of America launched QR code login for its CashPro platform in 2022, it wasn’t aiming for a viral hit. The goal was straightforward: eliminate a major point of friction for corporate clients. “Our data drives a lot of our innovation strategy,” Sanctis said. “And as a result, we engaged with the clients who we saw were having those challenges with password resets and built a solution side-by-side with them.” What has emerged isn’t just a better way to log in. It could be a full-blown rethinking of how trust, identity and authorization are able to function in high-value business transactions. Solving Authentication and B2B Security Bank of America’s strategy reflects a larger trend accelerating the digitization of B2B: the convergence of enterprise-grade security with consumer-grade simplicity. Because for treasury and finance professionals, security is paramount. But so is ease of use. A key benefit of the QR sign-in on the CashPro platform is the removal of the physical token — once a standard part of multifactor authentication. Instead, users can rely on the integrated mobile token built into the CashPro app. This is particularly impactful in regions like the U.K., where regulatory requirements can often demand strong authentication. And Bank of America’s European corporate clients, it turns out, use QR sign-in more than twice as often as their counterparts in other regions. “Many of our European clients are required to have strong authentication at the point of sign-in,” Sanctis said. “So, they don’t need to enter in an OTP [one-time password] with their physical token. They can just go through that flow as part of that QR sign-in experience.” While new login systems can often trigger anxiety about vulnerabilities, Sanctis noted that CashPro’s approach has won over even the most cautious users. “As soon as our clients become aware and realize that this is available to them, they start using it and it becomes a preferred method of signing in,” she said. “They recognize it as a security best practice.” Designing for Delight Every day, billions of dollars move through ERP platforms, treasury systems and supplier portals; all of them demanding secure, authenticated access. But the dominant authentication architectures are becoming cumbersome relative to the emerging needs of finance teams. QR logins meet the moment: secure, scalable and simple to deploy. And the success of QR sign-in stems not only from security and convenience but also from thoughtful design. User experience is central to Bank of America’s own digital transformation vision. CashPro’s mantra? “Personalized, proactive, predictive.” That philosophy underpins their newest rollout: push authentication. The feature eliminates the need for users to fetch or enter codes by delivering token requests directly to their devices. “We’re really taking the guesswork out of authentication,” Sanctis said. “The token will just come to them directly.” Launched this month, push authentication has already been used thousands of times, further validating the mobile-first shift. Notably, mobile token authentications surpassed physical authentications for the first time in Q1 2025. “That was heavily driven by QR sign-in,” said Sanctis, who expects mobile usage to continue accelerating as push authentication gains traction. “It’s a win-win for everybody.” QR code logins may not carry the flash of blockchain or the buzz of AI, but they represent something arguably more powerful: immediate, practical transformation. They’re reducing friction, closing security gaps, and enabling real-time financial agility for the over 2 million businesses that trust them.

QR code technology is an increasingly popular sign-in method among Bank of America’s corporate and commercial clients. The number of business clients using QR sign-in to access the bank’s digital banking platform, CashPro, increased by 60% in 2024, Bank of America said in a Tuesday (May 20) press release emailed to PYMNTS. QR sign-in was introduced in 2022. “Nearly every business client uses CashPro as the front door through which they view and take action on their Bank of America accounts,” Jennifer Sanctis, head of CashPro App and Personalized Technologies in Global Payments Solutions at Bank of America, said in the release. “QR sign-in makes that entry point even more secure and further enhances the client experience.” More than 40,000 business clients around the world use CashPro to manage their treasury, trade and credit operations and perform self-service requests, according to the release. With QR sign-in, they can sign in by using their mobile phone to scan the QR code that appears on the computer screen and sign in using biometrics, per the release. Clients with multifactor authentication can use the CashPro App to access a mobile token that is integrated into the sign-in flow. Because this sign-in experience does not require users to remember the CashPro password and does not require them to carry a physical token, it eliminates two key pain points associated with traditional login processes, the release said. One client who uses Bank of America’s QR sign-in, Karen Davis, head of treasury and trade finance for oil and gas at Glencore, said in the release that the process makes it easy to sign into CashPro. “I use the mobile token security that’s built into the process too, so I don’t need to worry about carrying around a physical token,” Davis said. Digital treasury solutions like CashPro offer an effective mix of convenience, control and security, Sanctis told PYMNTS in an interview posted in December. “Treasurers want more convenience and access at their fingertips,” Sanctis said. “Regardless of what our clients are needing to do, the app approval experience has been instrumental in giving them that extra peace of mind.” The post Bank of America: QR Sign-Ins by Business Clients Increased 60% appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The S&P 500 has historically rallied by an average of 17% when weak economic data fails to trigger an actual economic downturn. A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the afternoon of December 4, 2015 in New York City.Andrew Burton/Getty ImagesWeak economic sentiment could be a buy signal, Bank of America says.The market historically soars when weak sentiment fails to trigger a recession.BofA expects this to be the case this year.Investors have braced for a grim 2025 as weak sentiment data has hinted at looming pain, but the stock market could soar by double-digits if a recession ends up being nothing but talk, says Bank of America.The bank highlighted a growing gap between sentiment contained in \"soft data\" and what is actually happening in the economy. If lousy feelings about the economy don't end up morphing into an actual recession, that's historically been a trigger for a big rally in the stock market. \"In the past 70 years, when the ISM manufacturing & consumer surveys plunged but no recession followed, US stocks gained 17% and US credit 8% over the subsequent twelve months, outrunning long-term averages,\" the bank's Research Investment Committee wrote.Conditions are ripe for this scenario to transpire now. The ISM manufacturing PMI contracted for the second consecutive month in April, slipping to 48.7% — a reading that signals a bearish view of the manufacturing sector. Survey respondents cited high tariff uncertainty and an apprehensive business climate.Sentiment is equally bleak among consumers. The Conference Board's latest Consumer Confidence Index plunged in April, hitting levels not seen since the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Expectations Survey reached a 2011 low, giving a clear signal that a recession is inbound.Bank of AmericaBut these soft data points are at odds with hard data reports, which have been strong and include low jobless claims, a stabilizing dollar, tighter credit spreads, and inflation-beating wage growth. \"It's a record gap between bearish surveys & bullish facts,\" the bank said.For its part, BofA analysts do not see a recession forming, a view that has been shared by more forecasters since the Trump administration reached a temporary tariff truce with China over the weekend. The de-escalation has been pivotal for nervous investors, as the trade war with Beijing has been a core risk fueling recession angst.After a weak GDP reading in the first quarter — which economists agree was caused by a surge of imports ahead of tariff disruptions — BofA is betting that the second quarter will see a major reversal, marked by 2% GDP growth and weaker final demand.If a recession is avoided and the 17% year-on-year forecast pans out, this would pull the S&P 500 to nearly 6,900. BofA highlighted several other reasons to bet on summer upside, including progress on trade negotiations, a policy pivot to tax cuts and dereulgation, and onshoring from emerging markets.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Bank of America plans to open 150 new locations by the end of 2027. The new locations will be spread across 60 markets, the banking giant said in its announcement Tuesday (May 13). The plan calls for opening 40 new “financial centers,” as the lender calls its branches, this year and another 70 in 2026. “Our continued investment in our financial center network reflects our commitment to meeting our clients where they are and how they want to bank with us,” Bank of America Consumer, Retail and Preferred President Holly O’Neill said. “We are focused on creating spaces where financial specialists can meet with clients and help them achieve their financial goals.” The announcement notes the bank has invested $5 billion expanding and renovating its locations since 2016. That includes the opening of a new flagship financial center at Bryant Park in New York City, to allow customers to connect with financial specialists or have informal meetings. Bank of America says it is also pushing into some other markets, planning to open new financial centers throughout Idaho. As PYMNTS wrote last year, both Bank of America and rival J.P. Morgan Chase have been investing in physical banking locations in recent years. While both banks “conceded that local offices won’t supplant the convenience digital banking offers, both also said they recognize physical locations give consumers a place to go when they want to discuss loans or seek financial advice,” that report said. And it’s not just big banks that recognize value in brick-and-mortar sites. PYMNTS Intelligence research found that 12% of credit union (CU) members said they moved from traditional financial institutions to CUs specifically because their old banks didn’t have a local presence. Meanwhile, digital banking continues its onward march, driven by younger consumers, as PYMNTS wrote last month. A PYMNTS Intelligence study, “Generation Zillennial: Driving Financial Service Innovation,” examines the financial preferences and behaviors of this age group, spotlighting their strong inclination toward mobile-first banking, along with eagerness for innovative financial offerings. “Despite being digital natives with a keen interest in novel financial services like buy now, pay later (BNPL) and cryptocurrency, zillennials surprisingly show a greater affinity for national banks as their primary financial institution, signaling a nuanced relationship with the digital financial landscape,” PYMNTS wrote.

New research from Bank of America (BofA) shows consumer spending slowing for all income levels. That data, released by the Bank of America Institute on Friday (May 9), shows that consumer spending on inessentials has been declining since the year began. “The gradual easing in consumer spending momentum is not just due to lower inflation — the growth in the number of transactions has also cooled,” the report said. “Consumers appear to be pulling back particularly on bigger ticket discretionary services like airline tickets and lodging.” At the same time, nondiscretionary items continue to grow more expensive, with recent Consumer Price Index data showing increased prices for essentials like food and shelter. “The shelter and food metrics have also been showing stickier price increases than the overall headline number,” PYMNTS wrote last week. “For example, in March, the food at home index, which is a proxy for groceries, surged by 0.5%. Shelter rose 0.2%, and at an annual rate of 4% remains one of the areas where prices are rising the most.” Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has estimated that essential spending takes up more than 70% of a consumer’s paycheck. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Struggling Consumers Go to Short-Term Strategies to Manage Higher Expenses” found rents have been climbing, a phenomenon mentioned by half of the respondents to our survey. Meanwhile, the BofA report found that credit and debit card spending for all income groups is dipping, particularly among lower-income Americans. “Some slowdown in spending growth is consistent across income cohorts since the beginning of the year, though the spending growth of lower-income households is weakest,” the report said. The bank argued this is partly due to “relative softness” in these consumers’ after-tax wage growth. These households saw an after-tax wage gain of just 1.5% year over year in April. That’s slightly better than the prior month, though still a lower rate than the last two years, according to the bank’s deposit data. “The financial position of most consumers appears sound. One sign of that: more consumers are paying off their credit card balances every month, according to Bank of America credit card data,” the report added. “However, we see some increase in the share of households making only the minimum payment on their credit cards, suggesting building pressures for some households.” The post BofA: Spending Growth Slowing Among All Income Groups appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The S&P 500 has rallied sharply since April lows, but investors should be prepared for the gains to fade as more trade deals are announced, BofA said. Win McNamee/Getty ImagesBank of America's Michael Hartnett expects the stock rally to fade.Stock investors are behaving as if there has been more progress on trade negotiations.The current setup amounts to \"buy the expectation, sell the fact,\" Hartnett said.With one US trade deal announced this week, markets are upbeat about more progress to come, but investors should be wary of buying into trade optimism, Bank of America's chief investment strategist wrote.BofA's Michael Hartnett said the market's bounce since April's historic spasm of volatility suggests that investors are front-running the possibility of lower tariffs and more trade deals this quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 14% from April lows, but the rally leaves little room for more gains.\"We expect 'buy the expectation, sell the fact,'\" Hartnett and his team wrote. In their view, the rally will fade as more deals are announced.That's an unsettling prospect for analysts who have increasingly shaped their market outlooks around easing trade tensions. Deutsche Bank said recently that it thinks a meaningful dip in the tariff rate could deliver a sharp rally that pushes the S&P 500 to 6,150 by year-end.Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is particularly focused on the US reaching a trade deal with China, which could serve as a key catalyst for the benchmark index.But Hartnett is more bearish. In predicting that the rally will lose steam regardless of whether tariffs come down, he said he continues to favor international equities over US shares, as well as bonds and gold.The analysts said that investors are overexposed to the theme of \"US exceptionalism.\" The America-first trade is \"clashing with new populist policies of higher tariffs, smaller government, lower immigration, fewer wars,\" and other policies that will weigh on the country's growth.In November, Hartnett similarly warned that a long period of outperformance in US markets was nearing the end. For now, investors should stay invested in five-year Treasurys, at least until news on tax cuts, a China trade deal, and rate cuts. Read the original article on Business Insider",

The strategist said stocks had “correctly” rallied on optimism around lower tariffs in the second quarter. However, he doesn’t see further gains as investors “buy the expectation, sell the fact,” Hartnett wrote in a note. The S&P 500 has surged 14% since President Donald Trump announced a reprieve in some levies on April 9, although it remains 3.7% lower for the year, trailing international peers. Washington has also taken a softer tone on global trade in the past few weeks, and is weighing a dramatic tariff reduction during weekend talks with China.

        "description": "Financial service companies such as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are training their staff on internal AI tools that still need human management. Getty Images; Karan Singh for BISome financial institutions are prioritizing internal AI tools to enhance daily operations.For example, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have trained staff to use AI with human supervision.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.The financial industry's approach to artificial intelligence reveals considerable pragmatism.Popular notions of generative AI, guided by the explosive growth of OpenAI's ChatGPT, often center on consumer-facing chatbots. But financial institutions are leaning more heavily on internal AI tools that streamline day-to-day tasks.This requires training programs and user-experience design that help a bank's entire organization — from relationship bankers directing high-value accounts to associates — understand the latest AI technology.From AI classification to AI generationBanks have long used traditional AI and machine learning techniques for various functions, such as customer service bots and decision algorithms that provide a faster-than-human response to market swings.But modern generative AI is different from prior AI/ML methods, and it has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hari Gopalkrishnan, Bank of America's chief information officer and head of retail, preferred, small business, and wealth technology, said generative AI is a new tool that offers new capabilities, rather than a replacement for prior AI efforts.\"We have a four-layer framework that we think about with regards to AI,\" Gopalkrishnan told Business Insider.The first layer is rules-based automation that takes actions based on specific conditions, like collecting and preserving data about a declined credit card transaction when one occurs. The second is analytical models, such as those used for fraud detection. The third layer is language classification, which Bank of America used to build Erica, a virtual financial assistant, in 2016.\"Our journey of Erica started off with understanding language for the purposes of classification,\" Gopalkrishnan said. But the company isn't generating anything with Erica, he added: \"We're classifying customer questions into buckets of intents and using those intents to take customers to the right part of the app or website to help them serve themselves.\"The fourth layer, of course, is generative AI.Koren Picariello, a Morgan Stanley managing director and its head of wealth management generative AI, said Morgan Stanley took a similar path. Throughout the 2010s, the company used machine learning for several purposes, like seeking investment opportunities that meet the needs and preferences of specific clients. Many of these techniques are still used.\"Historically, I was working in analytics, data, and innovation within the wealth space. In that space, Morgan Stanley did focus on the more traditional AI/ML tools,\" Picariello told BI. \"Then in 2022, we started a dialogue with OpenAI before they became a household name. And that began our generative-AI journey.\"How banks are deploying AIGiven the history, it'd be reasonable to think banks would turn generative-AI tools into new chatbots that more or less serve as better versions of Bank of America's Erica, or as autonomous financial advisors. But the most immediate changes instead came to internal processes and tools.Morgan Stanley's first major generative-AI tool, Morgan Stanley Assistant, was launched in September 2023 for employees such as financial advisors and support staff who help clients manage their money. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, it was designed to give responses grounded in the company's library of over 100,000 research reports and documents.The second tool, Morgan Stanley Debrief, was launched in June. It helps financial advisors create, review, and summarize notes from meetings with clients.\"It's kind of like having the most informed person at Morgan Stanley sitting next to you,\" Picariello said. \"Because any question you have, whether it was operational in nature or research in nature, what we've asked the model to do is source an answer to the user based on our internal content.\"Bank of America is pursuing similar applications, including a call center tool that saves customer associates' time by transcribing customer conversations in real time, classifying the customer's needs, and generating a summary for the agent.Keeping humans in the loopThe decision to deploy generative AI internally first, rather than externally, was in part due to generative AI's most notable weakness: hallucinations.In generative AI, a hallucination is an inaccurate or nonsensical response to a prompt, like when Google Search's AI infamously recommended that home chefs use glue to keep cheese from sliding off a pizza.Banks are wary of consumer-facing AI chatbots that could make similar errors about bank products and policies.Deploying generative AI internally lessens the concern. It's not used to autonomously serve a bank's customers and clients but to assist bank employees, who have the option to accept or reject its advice or assistance.Bank of America provides AI tools that can help relationship bankers prep for a meeting with a client, but it doesn't aim to automate the bank-client relationship, Gopalkrishnan told BI.Picariello said Morgan Stanley takes a similar approach to using generative AI while maintaining accuracy. The company's AI-generated meeting summaries could be automatically shared with clients, but they're not. Instead, financial advisors review them before they're sent.Training the finance workforce for AIBank of America and Morgan Stanley are also training bank employees on how to use generative-AI tools, though their strategies diverge.Gopalkrishnan said Bank of America takes a top-down approach to educating senior leadership about the potential and risks of generative AI.About two years ago, he told BI, he helped top-level staff at the bank become \"well aware\" of what's possible with AI. He said having the company's senior leadership briefed on generative AI's perks, as well as its limitations, was important to making informed decisions across the company.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is concentrating on making the company's AI tools easy to understand.\"We've spent a lot of time thinking through the UX associated with these tools, to make them intuitive to use, and taking users through the process and cycle of working with generative AI,\" Picariello said. \"Much of the training is built into the workflow and the user experience.\" For example, Morgan Stanley's tools can advise employees on how to reframe or change a prompt to yield a better response.For now, banks are focusing AI initiatives on identifying and automating increasingly more complex and nuanced tasks within the organizations rather than developing one-off applications targeted at the customer experience.\"We try to approach problems not as a technology problem but as a business problem. And the business problem is that Bank of America employees all perform lots of tasks in the company,\" said Gopalkrishnan. \"The opportunity is to think more holistically, to understand the tasks and find the biggest opportunities so that five and 10 years from now, we're a far more efficient organization.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "According to a new report published by the Bank of America, many businesses will start using humanoid robots by 2028, and around 1 million units will be shipped yearly by 2030. The manufacturing price of each robot could be $17,000, and their adoption will happen in three stages. The report states that the first stage will be the deployment of humanoid robots in warehouses and factories, then they will start being used in businesses like hospitality and retail, and after that, they will finally get to houses. The report has also estimated that there will be 3 billion robots in the world by 2060. The number of these robots is based on the jobs they would replace. The humanoid robots will take over 20% of the industrial jobs, with the replacement of 1.5 to 2.5 workers in different industries, and there will be an average of 0.7 robots in every household. The first big wave of humanoid robots will be from 2028 to 2034, and it will focus on commercial use. The second wave will start in 2035, and it will make those robots available in homes for tasks like cooking, elder care, cleaning, and healthcare. In 2025, manufacturers of humanoid robots are expected to ship around 18,000 robots, and the number will reach 10 million per year by 2030. By 2060, there will be 2 billion humanoid robots in homes, 1 billion in service industries, and only a few hundred million in factories. This means that most of the humanoid workers will take over unpaid work at home, which will replace paid jobs. There will be many challenges to the mass adoption of robots as well, like more real-world data to train AI, more advanced AI for communication, cost-effective robot designs, and better motion and balance systems. The biggest problem with manufacturing humanoid robots is their hands, as they are very complex and make up 20% of the total robot’s cost.

With the emergence of cloud computing, 5G and advanced technologies, merchants can take advantage of enterprise-grade solutions designed to run their operations more efficiently. The lines between providers of those solutions are blurring. “You’re seeing software vendors becoming payment processors,” and vice versa, as Bank of America Merchant Solutions Head Wally Mlynarski told PYMNTS as part of the “What’s Next in Payments” series on the changing service economy. “The combination of the two solutions is changing the buying decision for these customers,” he said. “And they’re asking for more. They want more from their payments providers to be able to meet their needs.” The merchants themselves are expanding their own business models, which typically involve selling direct to consumers. In doing so, they are leveraging the power of their brand for digital direct-to-consumer experiences, which require the use of payment facilitation or marketplace models. While these models reduce storefront overhead, they drive a new need in helping contend regulatory changes, security concerns and meeting the demands of burgeoning populations of end customers. Value-added services enable those merchants to garner repeat business, to collect data as consumers buy goods and services online — and merchants can offer loyalty and rewards as well as individualized engagement with consumers. What SMBs Want Bank of America, for its own part, has conducted its own surveys of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), to ask what merchant services meant to those clients. The customers said they wanted offerings from service providers that help them run every aspect of their business. “They’re looking to these merchant processors and acquirers to provide more than just a transaction service,” Mlynarski said. These growing companies want automated employee time tracking, data management to optimize inventory and streamlined B2B payments — along with marketing tools to enhance their presence across digital and mobile channels. For Bank of America, Mlynarski said, “We don’t stop at integrating into the merchant’s business — we want to integrate into the financial lives of the merchants well. We try to bring the bank to our customers and operate in their territory,” integrating, for example, lending services so that capital is available as needed, with payments tied to back-office functions so that merchants can pay their suppliers efficiently with virtual cards. Bank of America, Mlynarski said, has used a partnership approach to deliver those value-added service to merchant clients in the retail, restaurant and healthcare verticals, among others. “Building those partnerships fill any gaps we might have,” he said, and underpin long-term sustainable growth. In some cases, he said, client firms are seeking data and analytics functions from those clients, with integrations into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Healthcare is a key example here, where back-office money movement needs to break free from paper-based communications and paper checks. Bank of America, he said, has been working to digitize those operations. Looking ahead, no matter whether they are consumer-facing or emanating from the back office, payments themselves should be intuitive and experiential, said Mlynarski, adding that transactions “should be in the background and automatic,” and they soon will be with artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics. “You shouldn’t be asked ‘How was your payment experience?’” he said, “Because it should just happen. “We’re listening to our customers and meeting them where they are in their payments experiences,” Mlynarski said, “and the landscape is vast and ever-changing. We’re there to meet the mark with our customers.” The post Bank of America Bets on Value-Added Services for Merchant Growth appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The days of high US stock valuations are over, says Bank of America's Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesUS stock valuations should decline, says Bank of America's Michael Hartnett.Stimulus and AI excitement drove S&P 500 gains, but valuations will normalize.Hartnett favors bonds, gold, and international stocks amid US macro risks.The days of high US stock valuations are over, says Bank of America's Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett.Since 2020, investors have been willing to pay a premium relative to S&P 500 company earnings. So-called price-to-earnings ratios have been elevated thanks to mammoth stimulus efforts amid the pandemic and excitement around artificial intelligence developments. The optimistic outlook has propelled stocks to 146% gains from COVID-19 lows.Over that time, S&P 500 PE ratios on a trailing 12-month basis have barely dipped below 20 times and have risen as high as 41x. The average PE ratio during the last five years was just shy of 26x. But Hartnett said in a client note on Thursday that things are going to start trending toward historical norms.GuruFocusSince 2000, the S&P 500's average PE ratio has been 20x. During the entire 20th century, the index's average valuation was 14x. Hartnett predicts that 2025 will mark the end of the era of elevated valuations.\"We say 2025 big picture is peak valuations in stocks and credit, following glory of past 5 years,\" Hartnett wrote.\"20x has been floor for S&P 500 P/E in first half of 2020s, a decade of magnificent US exceptionalism augmented by fiscal excess and AI boom,\" he continued. \"20x we say new ceiling for P/E as globalization reverses, Fed less independent, fiscal/monetary excess ends, 3-4% new inflation normal outside recessions, US savings rate rises.\"Equity valuations measure how expensive stocks are on a relative basis by looking at how much investors are paying compared to the earnings that companies actually generate.Other valuation measures, like the Shiller cyclically-adjusted PE ratio, show that US stocks remain at some of their most expensive levels in the last century.GuruFocusWhen valuations climb too high, long-term forward returns have historically been muted.For valuations to come down, stock prices either have to fall or earnings have to live up to or outperform elevated expectations.Given macro risks as President Donald Trump's trade war threatens a recession and another bout of inflation, Hartnett sees pain ahead for stock prices. Instead, he's bullish on safer assets like bonds and gold, as well as on international stocks — for the next couple of months, at least.\"We remain H1 buyers of dips in bonds, international & gold, sellers of SPX/US$ rallies,\" he wrote.One way investors can gain exposure to these trades is through funds like iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS), and the SPDR® Gold Shares (GLD).But it remains unclear whether a recession will materialize in the months ahead. Trump has shown that he will step back from hardline stances if investors react unfavorably.Still, 10% baseline tariffs remain on most imports, and an inflationary episode could hurt spending. Payrolls and inflation data in the coming weeks should give investors insight into the health of the economy.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Stocks rallied this week but BofA says it's a selling opportunity until there's further progress on key issues facing the market. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesInvestors should sell the rally in US stocks and the dollar, BofA analyst Michael Hartnett said.\"We remain [first-half] buyers of dips in bonds, international & gold, sellers of SPX/US$ rallies.\"Three factors could help end the market's \"pain trade.\"Bank of America isn't convinced the recent stock market rally can last, and instead thinks investors are better off selling into any upside while uncertainty persists. \"Sell hubris, buy humiliation,\" is the advice from the bank's chief investment strategist, Michael Hartnett. \"We remain [first-half] buyers of dips in bonds, international & gold, sellers of SPX/US$ rallies,\" he and his team wrote Thursday, adding that the market's \"pain trade\" suggests more downside ahead.The outlook comes amid this week's positive momentum for the S&P 500. The benchmark index is up 7.3% from a Monday low, surging on signs that Washington's trade war with China could finally ease.But a durable rally can't happen unless three specific developments materialize, Hartnett outlined.First, the US must reach a trade deal, one that would reduce the tariff rate on Chinese exports below 60%.That's the rate floated by President Donald Trump during his campaign, but so far duties have been much higher. Aggressive tit-for-tat trade tensions have pumped the Chinese tariff rate to 145%, which Beijing met with its own steep tariffs on US goods.Trump has finally signaled that trade talks are underway to ease the conflict, though Beijing has flatly denied that discussions have taken place. In a recent note, Deutsche Bank warned that the longer it takes to achieve a tariff unwind, the worse the repercussions for the US economy.Second, the Federal Reserve must help push US Treasury yields lower by cutting interest rates.April's tariff drama sent shockwaves through the bond market, sending benchmark yields higher. Fedspeak indicating its support for the market could help deliver lower yields, which would further dissipate if interest rates were reduced. Comments from Fed officials this week hinted at a readiness to cut rates in the summer if economic data weakens. As of Friday afternoon, investors indicate they see a 60% chance the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points at its June meeting. Third, consumers must remain resilient.So far, Hartnett continues to see solid spending, possibly due to the enduring strength of the labor market. For now, this has lowered expectations of a US consumer recession driven by declining equity wealth among higher-income households and mounting inflation angst.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Wall Street fund managers are going \"risk-off\" doubling down on gold and reducing tech holdings, according to Bank of America Getty ImagesInstitutional investors' expectations for the economy are at 30-year lows.They're ditching US stocks and betting on gold to be the top performer this year.Here's what else fund managers are doing to prepare for a potential recession.If the trade war is making you fear for your portfolio, you're not alone.Institutional investors are also on high alert. Bank of America's latest Fund Manager Survey shows that the biggest money managers are concerned about President Donald Trump's trade policy sparking a global recession.The survey, which collected insights from fund managers globally between April 4 and 10 — right as markets were going haywire because of tariff announcements — revealed that investor expectations for global growth hit 30-year lows in April, with 82% of fund managers expecting a weaker economy this year.Tariff policy continues to fluctuate, which means heightened volatility is probably not going away anytime soon. How are institutional investors protecting their billion-dollar portfolios in this environment? As money managers flee from previous market winners like tech and US equities, here's what they're buying instead.Betting on goldInvestors are conflicted on many things: whether Trump's tariffs are a negotiating tactic or an actual policy proposal, whether the US will enter a recession, and whether a potential AI bubble has popped.But they all agree on one thing: gold is the way to go. Forty-two percent of survey respondents believe the yellow metal will be the best-performing asset in 2025 — up from just 23% in March.Bank of AmericaAs seen in the graph above, investor confidence in global equities, US equities, and bitcoin has declined monthly this year. Investors are now the most underweight in global equities since July 2023.Fund managers are dumping traditional stocks and increasing their allocations to gold, which has long been regarded as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge in times of economic turmoil. The fact that investors are losing confidence in the US dollar is only fueling the exodus into gold: expectations for the US dollar to depreciate are at their highest levels since May 2006, with a net 61% of investors expecting the US dollar to depreciate over the next 12 months.Gold is so popular that investors now believe the \"long gold\" trade is more crowded than the \"long Magnificent Seven\" trade that dominated markets for the last two years.Bank of AmericaDon't just take it from fund managers — this week, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) surpassed $100 billion in intra-day AUM for the first time in the fund's history, indicating that institutional and retail investors are adding to their gold allocations. The price of gold has hit several records this year, most recently breaking $3,300 an ounce.Here's what else Wall Street's doingIn addition to buying gold, investors are taking a few other steps to protect their portfolios.They're severely dialing back their risk appetites and looking for more recession-resilient investments. Continuing a trend from earlier this year, institutional investors are pulling back on their Big Tech investments. According to Bank of America, fund managers are net 17% underweight on the tech sector, the lowest allocation since November 2022.What's taking the place of tech allocations? Holding cash sounds simple, but its yields above 4% make it a safe choice in a market where stocks keep sliding into the red. Cash levels among institutional investors are at 4.8% today, a 1.25% increase from two months ago. For context, according to Bank of America's Global FMS Cash Indicator, cash levels at or above 5% serve as a contrarian indicator to buy global equities, as it indicates extreme pessimism.In addition to holding cash, survey respondents reported record increases in fixed income, utilities, healthcare, and staples allocations in April.Bank of AmericaInvestors can get exposure to these trades through funds like the Franklin Investment Grade Corporate ETF (FLCO), the Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT), the iShares US Utilities ETF (IDU), and the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FTSA).Read the original article on Business Insider",

Why it matters: The most recent Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America underscores the thesis that global investors are selling America.By the numbers: The most recent survey, which was conducted between April 4 and April 10, included 164 global fund managers who collectively have $386 billion of assets under management. 49% of them said that a hard landing is now the most likely outcome for the global economy, up from 6% in February and 11% in March.

        "description": "Trump's trade war is causing all sorts of extreme dislocations in market and economic sentiment. ReutersInvestors are the most pessimistic they've been on the economy in 30 years, according to BofA.They're also gloomy on the market, with a record share of investors planning to pare stock holdings.Bank of America surveyed 164 fund managers with $386 billion of assets under management.A new survey shows investors haven't felt this dour on the economy in decades, another sign of how heavily Donald Trump's trade war is weighing on sentiment.As part of its weekly Global Fund Manager survey, Bank of America took the pulse of 164 fund managers with $386 billion of assets under management.As shown by the dark blue in the chart below, global growth expectations have fallen to a 30-year low. The light blue line sees a similar — although not quite as extreme — decline in S&P 500 expectations.82% of fund managers said they were expecting a weaker global economy in 2025.Bank of America Global Fund Manager SurveyPessimism around equities specifically was seen in another measure surveyed by BofA: the number of participants planning to trim exposure to US stocks. As shown below, this fell to a record low.A record percent of fund managers say they intended to cut their holdings of US stocks in April.Bank of America Global Fund Manager SurveyThe sharp decline in expectations reflects how hard investors have been hit by Trump's Liberation Day tariffs, which helped spark the worst stock sell-off since the pandemic after Trump officially rolled out the tariffs in early April.The major indexes have clawed back some of the losses since Trump issued a 90-day pause on most of his tariffs.

First, markets are antsy about the impact import duties could have on US growth, with chatter about a potential recession making the rounds on Wall Street in recent weeks.Second, traders are worried about the inflationary impact of tariffs, as companies could pass tariff-related price increases onto consumers. Fears of higher inflation are also raising concerns about stagflation, a nightmare scenario for the economy that involves sluggish growth and stubbornly high prices.80% of fund managers said they believed the biggest tail risk to markets was the trade war triggering a global recession, according to the BofA survey.

In a quarter overshadowed by tariff discussions and global economic jitters, three of the nation’s largest financial institutions — PNC, Citigroup, and Bank of America — presented first-quarter earnings Tuesday (April 15) that pointed to both lingering uncertainties and resilient consumer spending. Analysts and investors were keenly focused on whether consumers would begin to show signs of strain amid fluctuating economic signals, but the banks’ results demonstrated that, for now at least, the U.S. consumer remains on solid footing. A unifying thread across all three earnings calls was the emphasis on continuing demand from retail customers, underscored by robust credit- and debit-card activity. Bank of America’s supplemental results revealed that credit and debit spending was up 4%, with the number of transactions rising 2% to total $228 billion. At Citigroup, executives spotlighted comparable momentum in consumer businesses, with U.S. Personal Banking revenue reaching a record $5.2 billion. Meanwhile, PNC underscored its own ability to attract and retain clients, highlighting growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan commitments despite the uncertain climate. In short, executives from all three institutions painted a picture of a consumer who, while selective, remains a potent force in sustaining spending. Uncertainty, however, set the broader context for each discussion. Across multiple calls, tariff concerns and the possibility of a near-term recession cast a shadow over corporate and commercial lending decisions. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that while “organic growth remains strong,” businesses remain “sanguine on the current environment” but are re-evaluating capital expenditures amid shifting trade policy. At PNC, CEO William S. Demchak spoke candidly about volatility, remarking that these “fluid” conditions might ultimately raise the probability of recession if tariffs persist longer than anticipated. Similar caution was evident at Citigroup, which saw strong trading profits partly attributed to hedging and market activities tied to macroeconomic volatility. This environment of uncertainty appeared in loan portfolios as well. PNC Chief Financial Officer Robert Q. Reilly noted that the bank had not changed its guidance precisely because of the evolving situation, while at Bank of America, commercial lending was flat, a signal that corporate clients are deliberate about tapping credit lines in a setting rife with trade policy shifts. Citigroup, for its part, chose to fortify its credit reserves for card losses and set aside an additional allowance for credit losses tied to the “challenging macro environment.” Still, executives repeatedly stressed the relatively healthy state of the consumer. Moynihan pointed out that Bank of America’s internal data suggested that year-over-year consumer spending growth carried into April at a 5% rate. Much of this spending, he said, flows through multiple channels such as debit, credit, Zelle, and checks — indicating consumers are finding ways to keep money circulating in the economy. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser similarly noted that card portfolios showed “elevated” but still manageable levels of credit losses, aligned with an environment in which rising interest rates and inflation have begun to pinch certain segments of consumers. At PNC, Demchak said while everyday borrowers may well feel the brunt of uncertainty, sophisticated investors and well-capitalized commercial clients can seize opportunities when markets become unsettled. It wasn’t just spending that drew focus; the banks also highlighted the accelerating shift toward digital channels. Bank of America spotlighted a 65% digital sales mix in its most recent quarter — an increase from 53% a year earlier. Zelle payments reached $130 billion, up from $106 billion in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Moynihan touted new achievements for the bank’s virtual assistant Erica, now at 2.7 billion interactions since its 2018 launch. Citigroup showcased its own technological pivot, implementing artificial intelligence tools to modernize onboarding, detect unauthorized trades, and automate code reviews. These moves suggest that, despite caution around economic unknowns, banks continue to invest heavily in digital transformation to meet evolving customer expectations. Concluding the quarter’s discourse was a note of guarded optimism. PNC’s Demchak said the bank is “growing just fine,” with enough capital to support clients, even if a downturn arrives faster or heavier than anticipated. Bank of America’s CFO Alastair Borthwick emphasized that deposit growth has outstripped initial expectations, providing liquidity cushions. Citigroup, while acknowledging higher credit costs and ongoing structural changes, maintained full-year guidance on net interest income and expenses. Across all three calls, the overarching message was that while commercial clients may temporarily hold off on bigger investments, and credit costs could inch upward, the U.S. consumer’s resilience appears to support at least a measured outlook for the remainder of the year. In summary, Tuesday’s first-quarter earnings from Bank of America, PNC and Citigroup reinforced a collective narrative: Robust consumer spending is propping up results, even as companies and institutions grapple with an unclear macroeconomic landscape. Tariffs and the potential for a recession have not yet dramatically curbed consumer appetite, though some pullback in commercial lending and elevated caution on credit were evident. Digital adoption across retail banking and payments continues at a brisk pace, reflecting banks’ strategic push toward technology-driven growth. All three institutions remain watchful but confident that, if the climate grows stormier, they have the balance-sheet strength, client relationships, and technological capabilities to navigate what lies ahead.

While Americans are worried about the economy, it hasn’t kept them from spending. As The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (April 15), Bank of America’s latest earnings report showed consumer spending increasing when tariff worries first appeared. This followed last week’s JPMorgan Chase earnings, which also showed upticks in credit card and debit card spending. Bank executives also noted that spending has remained consistent since the quarter ended, even after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” brought substantial new tariffs. JPMorgan argues that some of that might have been people making purchases to escape tariff-related price increases. “This is consumers continuing to spend, and that is ultimately the basis of the U.S. economy,” said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America’s chief financial officer, on a call with reporters. “The signals at this point from the consumer are that the U.S. economy still remains in good shape.” Recession concerns and fears of high prices have ramped up this month when the new tariffs triggered market upheaval. Consumer sentiment has fallen to lows not seen since the Great Recession, and executives on Wall Street are warning that the White House’s tariff campaign could bring forth an economic downturn. According to the report, banks are seeing stronger indications of reduced spending among their corporate clients. “Everyone is prepping for more headwinds,” Mark Mason, Citigroup’s finance chief, told reporters. “Some companies are bolstering already strong balance sheets. Others are accelerating imports to stockpile inventory.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan noted a similar trend during his firm’s earnings call on Tuesday, saying business clients were worried about tariffs and where they should invest. “And I think that’s slowing down some of their decision paths right now because they’re trying to figure out ‘for my goods and services, will I be able to pass through the price? Do I need this change my business plans in terms of growth? Should I buy that piece of equipment?’ That’s why line usage has been relatively muted still, and we continue to try to grow it,” he said. Meanwhile, forthcoming research from PYMNTS Intelligence shows that while consumers may be continuing to spend, they are drawing lines between what they’re willing to spend their money on and what they can skip. Even in essential categories such as groceries, the report found a hierarchy of what consumers think of as “indispensable.” “While most consumers would try to buy fewer or cheaper groceries and dine out less, only a small percentage would completely eliminate items in those categories. Just 3.4% would stop buying milk (dairy or plant-based),” PYMNTS wrote. “Restaurant dining, on the other hand, is viewed as more discretionary, with 14% willing to cut it out entirely after price increases.” The post Big Banks: Consumers Keep Spending Despite Tariff Worries appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Bank of America called Netflix stock a \"defensive choice\" compared to other tech companies. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhotoNetflix shares have outperformed a struggling broader market this year, rising more than 10%.The stock is seen by some analysts as particularly well-positioned to withstand a recession.Shares climbed more than 5% on Tuesday on a report the company is aiming to double revenue by 2030.What sell-off?As major stock indexes have gotten off to a rocky start this year, Netflix has been a beacon of strength, handily outpacing the broader market and its mega-cap tech peers.The company has climbed more than 10% since the start of January, compared to an 8% loss for the S&P 500 and an even-sharper 17% decline for the elite Magnificent 7 cohort.Netflix's market domination continued on Tuesday, with shares surging as much as 6% on a report that the company is aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030. (It's currently valued at $420 billion.)But that doesn't tell the whole story. To fully appreciate Netflix's vast outperformance, one must look at how the stock has held up over a longer period that has featured repeated recession alarms.Bank of America highlighted Netflix's recession-averse nature in a Tuesday research note in which they reiterated their \"buy\" rating on the stock. Its 12-month price target of $1,175 marks 26% upside from Monday's close.\"Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors and driven outperformance versus other technology/Mag 7 companies,\" analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote.Joe Terranova, chief market strategist at Virtus Investment, also considers Netflix a \"recession resistant\" stock.\"Think about consumer behaviors in a recessionary climate. What are you going to be doing less of?\" Terranova said on CNBC on Tuesday. \"Less of going out to find entertainment, and actually staying home to enjoy the entertainment you have with Netflix.\"For Bank of America, Netflix has ample opportunity for long-term growth through subscriber growth in international markets, subscription price increases, and advertising growth.\"The company still sees a significant opportunity for growth, driven in large part by expansion into international markets,\" the strategists wrote.\"To the extent the company sees a runway for continued strong subscriber growth, we think it should give investors confidence in Netflix's ability to grow over the next several years,\" they added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Consumers are still spending, Bank of America’s earnings showed Tuesday (April 15), despite the volatility of what CEO Brian Moynihan termed a “changing economy.” The supplementals revealed that credit and debit spend was up 4%, while the number of transactions gained 2%, to $228 billion. Bank of America stressed digital adoption trends, where digital sales as a percentage of total sales stood at 65% in the most recent quarter to $1.9 billion, up from the 53% and $1.7 billion seen in the same period of 2022. Zelle payments were $130 billion in volume, up from $106 billion in the year-ago first quarter. Net charge-offs, meanwhile, were flat, at $1.5 billion, as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Investors sent the shares 3% higher at the start of trading on Tuesday. During his comments to analysts on the earnings call, Moynihan said: “Organic growth remains strong across the businesses” as the bank added new checking accounts, which grew by 250,000 accounts in the quarter. And with a nod to the digital engagement, Moynihan said that its digital assistant Erica has surpassed more than 2.7 billion interactions since inception in 2018. “Transactions sent through Zelle at Bank of America are not only three times the number of checks written by our Bank of American customers,” he said, “but they are also 1.3 times the number of checks written plus the number of cash transactions taking money out of the ATMs.” Consumers Keep Putting Money Into the Economy He said later in the call that at a macro level, “there’s a lot that could potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and other policies in the future path of the economy … but going more to what our customer data shows, it shows that the money moving across all our consumer spending methods, debit credit cards, ACH checks written, Zelle, etc. All that aggregate [data] shows a group about 4.4% pace in the first quarter … That pace has also continued through April. We note that some retailers may say that their sales are slow and others are picking up, and it really reflects the change in consumer spending behavior. But in the aggregate, the consumer keeps pushing money into the economy.” CFO Alastair Borthwick said on the call: “We already saw modestly better deposit growth in the first quarter than we expected … Consumer net charge-offs were … consistent with the past few quarters,” as 90% of the $1.1 billion in consumer net charge-offs were tied to credit cards. Consumer banking deposits continued to increase from their mid August low, said the CFO, and now stand at $972 billion, up from the recent $928 billion. Moynihan noted on the call that the card net charge-off ratio of 4% comes against a backdrop where the average cardholder and borrower FICO score is 777. About 12% of the portfolio is exposed to borrowers with a FICO score below 660, he said. Asked on the conference call about the state of consumer spending subsequent to the quarter’s end, management said on the call that through the first few weeks of April, spending growth has been running at 5%. “Consumers are still solidly in the game,” Moynihan said. Businesses Are ‘Sanguine’ On the commercial side of the business, commercial loans were flat from the end of the year at $196 billion. Moynihan stated that businesses are “basically sanguine on the current environment, but they’re worried about how [tariffs] will affect their businesses and where they should invest. And I think that’s slowing down some of their decision paths right now because they’re trying to figure out ‘for my goods and services, will I be able to pass through the price? Do I need this change my business plans in terms of growth? Should I buy that piece of equipment?’ That’s why line usage has been relatively muted still, and we continue to try to grow it.” The post Bank of America CEO: ‘Consumers are Still Solidly in the Game’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Bank of America will reportedly pay $540.3 million following a judge’s ruling in a lawsuit in which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) accused the bank of paying less than it owed for deposit insurance. The judge’s decision was made public Monday (April 14), Reuters reported Monday. The FDIC sued Bank of America for $1.12 billion in 2017, alleging that the bank failed to honor a 2011 rule that changed how banks report risk exposure to counterparties and thereby reduced its deposit insurance contributions, according to the report. Bank of America denied that it attempted to evade payments, the report said. The judge ruled against the bank’s claims that there was no reasonable basis for the rule, saying that the FDIC was not required to develop a “perfect measure” of predicting banks’ potential exposure to losses, per the report. However, the judge also ruled that the FDIC filed its lawsuit too late to make claims before the second quarter of 2013, so the amount the bank was ordered to pay covers assessments from the second of 2013 through the end of 2014, according to the report. Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesperson, said in the report: “We are pleased the judge has ruled and have reserves reflecting the decision.” This decision came at a time when the FDIC, like other regulatory agencies, is being rapidly reshaped. The FDIC’s new acting chairman, Travis Hill, said at the start of the new administration in January that he would “conduct a wholesale review of regulations, guidance and manuals” and “adopt a more open-minded approach to innovation and technology adoption, including (1) a more transparent approach to FinTech partnerships and to digital assets and tokenization, and (2) engagement to address growing technology costs for community banks.” In addition, the FDIC would seek to “encourage more de novo activity so there is a healthy pipeline of new entrants in the banking sector,” Hill said. In March, the FDIC provided new guidance saying that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they adequately manage the associated risks. Previously, under a guidance that is now rescinded, the FDIC required prior notification of those activities.

Artificial intelligence continues to dominate headlines as businesses accelerate their digital transformations. From banking to AI models, here are the top stories PYMNTS published this week. Companies Use AI to Help Mitigate Tariff Impacts The ability of AI to make businesses more efficient is coming in handy as President Donald Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs is making the markets swoon. A Zilliant survey found that 83% of U.S. C-suite leaders are using AI to adapt their pricing strategies to economic volatility. AI can help by monitoring and understanding tariffs in real time; finding new suppliers or sources for raw materials; improving scenario planning; raising worker productivity; and reducing costs. Bank of America Invests in New Initiatives Like AI Bank of America is allocating $4 billion toward new initiatives including AI in 2025, or nearly a third of its overall tech budget. The financial services giant is seeing the benefits of using AI and machine learning, a journey it began in 2018 after launching an AI-powered virtual assistant called Erica to help consumers with financial matters. That’s four years before ChatGPT became a household name. Gains across its business include a 50% reduction in calls to IT support after employees began using Erica for Employees, an internal AI chatbot. Developers were able to raise their efficiency by 20%. Employees save tens of thousands of hours per year by using AI to prepare materials ahead of client meetings, while sales and trading teams are more quickly and efficiently finding and summarizing Bank of America research and market commentary. AI Helps Businesses Streamline Payment Processes AI is becoming the equivalent of a corporate “pacemaker” as the technology helps enterprises manage their financial operations by automating and regulating billions of dollars in disbursements. The result is that AI is becoming a profit center that helps businesses streamline their payment processes, ensure disbursements flow on time and in the right amount, and better manage their capital. More than 80% of chief financial officers at large companies are either already using AI or considering adopting it for a core financial function, according to a forthcoming PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Smart Spending: How AI Is Transforming Financial Decision Making.” Salesforce Sees Massive Growth in Data Cloud Platform Salesforce is experiencing explosive growth in its data cloud platform, driven by enterprise demand for generative and agentic AI, technologies that rely on clean, unified, real-time data to be effective. In an interview with PYMNTS, Gabrielle Tao, senior vice president of product management at Salesforce, said most companies struggle to unlock the full value of their scattered and siloed data. Meta’s Open-Source Llama 4 Bad for Rivals Like OpenAI Meta released its open-source Llama 4 models this week: Llama 4 Scout and Maverick. They are the first multimodal models from Meta, meaning they can ingest images, not only text. Scout has a 10 million token context window (the amount of space for prompts). The previous record holder was Google’s Gemini 2.5, with 1 million and going up to 2 million. Llama 4 is a challenge to proprietary models from OpenAI and Google.

        "description": "Gold is generally regarded as one of the safest investments around.Srinophan69/Getty ImagesSome investors seek safe-haven assets in troubled times such as the current tariff-induced market turmoil.Gold hit record highs this year, with Bank of America maintaining its target of $3,500 an ounce.US dollar weakness and turmoil in bond markets indicate some doubts over their safe-haven status.The turmoil engulfing global stock markets in recent days has prompted some investors to seek out \"safe-haven\" assets that typically maintain their value during periods of market turbulence.Here's some of the main safe-haven assets and how \"safe\" they're proving in the market turmoil.1.

The return on 10-year Treasurys hit \"There's no sign yet that the market is managing to successfully find a bottom, and it feels like no asset class has been spared as investors continue to price in a growing probability of a US recession,\" the Deutsche analysts wrote.4. Defensive stocksDefensive stocks are companies that generally have stable performance regardless of the economic situation, because they sell goods or provide services that consumers will keep needing to buy.Customers exit a Costco Warehouse in Pennsylvania.Gene Puskar/APCostco is one example. The retailer's stock has fallen in the past five days at Tuesday's close, but by just 4% and is almost flat for the year. The stock is faring better than Walmart, which is down 7.3% over the past five days and almost 10% this year, while Amazon's declines total 9% and 22% respectively.5. CashLast but not least, there's cash — and even that has some downsides.\"Cash is seen as a safe haven because if you have money that isn't invested, it can't lose,\" DeLorenzo said. \"However, if assets increase in value, your cash doesn't, and that implicitly subjects your cash to losing value. Also, inflation hurts cash assets.\"For Accomazzo, cash offers a respectable yield and no volatility, but he also likes bonds.\"Despite their negative correlation to inflation, bonds might just be the better option on an intermediate horizon given current good yields and a shot at principal appreciation if rates ultimately come down,\" he said.Read the original article on Business Insider Gold is generally regarded as one of the safest investments around.Srinophan69/Getty ImagesSome investors seek safe-haven assets in troubled times such as the current tariff-induced market turmoil.Gold hit record highs this year, with Bank of America maintaining its target of $3,500 an ounce.US dollar weakness and turmoil in bond markets indicate some doubts over their safe-haven status.The turmoil engulfing global stock markets in recent days has prompted some investors to seek out \"safe-haven\" assets that typically maintain their value during periods of market turbulence.Here's some of the main safe-haven assets and how \"safe\" they're proving in the market turmoil.1.

Bank of America is allocating $4 billion — or nearly a third of its overall technology budget for this year — toward new initiatives including AI, according to a Tuesday (April 8) news release. The investment comes as the financial services giant sees the fruits of using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning since 2018, when it launched an AI-powered virtual assistant called Erica to help consumers with financial matters — four years before ChatGPT became a household name. BofA said it saw the following gains across its business units: Erica for Employees, an internal AI chatbot built on the customer-facing Erica, is being used by more than 90% of BofA’s 213,000 employees. This has reduced IT support calls by more than 50%. Bank of America developers using a generative AI-based coding assistant saw efficiency gains of 20% Employees save tens of thousands of hours per year by using AI to prepare materials for business client meetings, which they redirect toward client engagement. Customer service representatives use an AI tool to deliver a more personalized interaction with clients, reducing call handling times. Sales and trading teams use a generative AI platform developed internally to search and summarize BofA research and market commentary “more quickly and efficiently.” BofA’s experience is an example of AI’s impact in financial services and serves as a pragmatic case study to its peers just embarking on the same journey. Its tech investment is part of a broader strategy to embed AI across its operations to boost efficiency, employee productivity and client service. The financial services company has been deploying AI and machine learning since Erica debuted seven years ago. Bank of America said Erica has since handled more than 2.5 billion interactions and serves 20 million active users. The internal version was introduced in 2020 and quickly gained traction during the pandemic, initially helping staff with IT support tasks like password resets and device activations. It now offers assistance on a wide range of topics, from health benefits to payroll forms. The bank plans to further expand Erica for Employees’ capabilities this year, incorporating generative AI to help workers more easily access information about the bank’s products and services, among other topics. Read more: Bank of America Says Real-Time Payments Connect Businesses to Working Capital Scaling Customer and Employee Training Bank of America’s professional development arm, known as The Academy, is also leveraging artificial intelligence for employee training. Staff completed more than 1 million simulated client interactions in 2024, receiving real-time feedback designed to help them provide better service. Tools like askMerrill and askPrivate Banking, which apply the same AI technology behind Erica, have also seen growing use — garnering more than 23 million interactions in 2024, up 1 million year over year. These platforms help Merrill and private banking teams locate relevant information as well as escalate queries to human experts, if necessary. AI is also being used to process customer feedback at scale. A generative AI system deployed in call centers summarizes client conversations, reducing the need for manual transcription. “AI is having a transformative effect on employee efficiency and operational excellence,” Aditya Bhasin, BofA’s chief technology and information officer, said in the release. “Our use of AI at scale and around the world enables us to further enhance our capabilities, improve employee productivity and client service, and drive business growth.” BofA said it holds nearly 7,400 patents and pending applications, including more than 1,200 focused on AI and machine learning.

Workers are seen as new construction takes place at the Umbria a Lennar Corp. project on September 19, 2011 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesHomebuilder materials firms face a 20% hit to EPS from tariffs, BofA saysTariffs are bound to lift product prices, adding to housing costs.The sector dropped 12% since Trump's unveiled the latest duties on imports last week. A double-digit earnings hit to American building product companies is on the horizon as tariffs stir up industry headwinds.Bank of America said unmitigated earnings-per-share could tank 20% across the sector unless current tariff announcements are adjusted. Earnings are the chief driver of a stock's performance.Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump unleashed a slew of tariffs that far surpassed market expectations. Some countries now face steep duties, which is likely to trigger price hikes on building components sourced outside the US.Construction product and distributor firms suffered a 12% market plunge since the announcement, BofA noted.\"We believe the announcement was most negative for plumbing manufacturers (FBIN/MAS) that have shiſted production out of China into SE Asia in recent years and still have China exposure,\" bank analysts wrote Tuesday. \"Mohawk and Whirlpool could be relatively well positioned vs. competitors that have a smaller US manufacturing footprint, but could face demand destruction in a weak economic backdrop.\"Bank of AmericaSome companies are bound to see a bigger EPS decline, with the Latham Group and Fortune Brands Innovation potentially facing a 58% and 42% earnings drop, the bank said. However, these estimates could change meaningfully based on how trade policy evolves.But overall, the bank's forecasts show how tariffs are injecting extreme uncertainty into the US housing market. While US levies may have helped ease mortgage rates since Wednesday, industry insiders are turning cautious about higher home prices to come.A National Association of Home Builders survey recently estimated that the cost of a home will rise $9,200 because of tariffs.BofA notes that some manufacturers have already announced price hikes to offset changing trade headwinds, though product volumes are at risk of falling if tariffs impact demand.On average, the bank expects that prices will need to climb 1.5% to counterbalance new duties.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Fund managers aren't acting like danger is imminent. Here's where they're putting money to work now, including 12 stocks they're excited about. Jonathan Kirn/Getty ImagesPortfolio managers' positioning doesn't seem to suggest that danger is imminent.Bank of America analyzed hundreds of funds and came to surprising conclusions.Here are 12 stocks that managers seem to be getting excited about.Money managers seem to be betting that the market's biggest fears are overblown.Professional investors aren't bracing for stagflation, a trade war between the US and Europe, or damaging cuts by DOGE, according to Bank of America. That's based on the firm's recently published analysis of around 370 large-cap mutual funds with a combined $2.6 trillion in assets.Judging by how mutual funds are positioned, managers also don't seem to be banking on a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire or a major recovery for manufacturing, BofA's early April report said.If economic growth levels off and inflation picks up, managers may want to gravitate toward sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and energy, which have historically performed best in stagflationary settings, according to BofA.Bank of AmericaBut managers are underexposed to all three of these groups, even though more than 70% of respondents to BofA's fund manager survey have said that they're prepared to see stagflation.Bank of AmericaThose running mutual funds are also leaning into US stocks with the most sales exposure to Europe, despite seemingly rising tensions in global trade. European equities are also red hot, as BofA said they received some of the largest passive inflows ever in the first quarter of 2025.Bank of AmericaOther notable investment decisions are within industrials, where there's a near-record allocation to US defense stocks and otherwise light positioning, especially in machinery. That seems to suggest that the US will continue to support Ukraine, even as government spending is under the microscope as the national debt load looms. Otherwise, investors aren't thrilled about the sector.Bank of AmericaAlthough some of these seemingly contrarian calls may be headscratching, fund managers may be going against the grain for a reason.Active funds broadly have consistently trailed their benchmarks, as BofA previously reported that just 30% outperformed last year. After record inflows into passive funds in 2024 that have continued this year, it makes sense that money managers are taking some risks to get an edge.Bank of America12 stocks that pros increasingly loveWhile fund managers are trying to set themselves apart, they also have some similar ideas.Bank of America highlighted 50 stocks in the S&P 500 that mutual fund managers have been disproportionately \"crowding\" into, as measured by growth in relative weight in the last month. Of these increasingly popular names, 12 saw their relative weights rise by at least 0.1 points.Below are those dozen companies that money managers are betting on most aggressively now. Curiously, only a few of the stocks are in sectors that perform best when there's stagflation.Along with each is its ticker, sector, annual sector performance during stagflation, one-month change in relative weight, and one-month change in ownership percentage by long-only funds.1.

        "description": "Gen Z and millennials spend around three times as much as baby boomers do on fitness, according to data from Bank of America. Jason McDonald/Courtesy of B The Method; Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIGen Zers and millennials are to thank for propping up one area of the market in particular: health and wellness.Younger Americans are spending significantly more in the category, BofA data shows.That could give wellness stocks a boost and help the sector weather a recession, analysts said.Gen Zers and millennials are spending big and helping insulate one area of the market from a recession: the wellness industry.Bank of America analysts said Tuesday that younger Americans look to be driving a long-term interest toward healthier lifestyle habits, something that could support the health and wellness sector to continue to grow even if the economy turns.\"We believe there is an ongoing generational shift toward healthy habits, which is supportive of wellness stocks. Younger demographics including Gen Z and millennials are increasingly prioritizing healthy ways of living and spending increased time and income on fitness, activity-based leisure, and wellness focused discretionary items,\" the bank wrote in a note on Tuesday.As a whole, households look like they're starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Retail sales rose 0.2% in February, well below the 0.7% growth economists were expecting for the month. Still, spending at fitness centers climbed 7% year-over-year, Bank of America card data shows, the largest increase in 19 months.On average, Gen Z households spend around 2.8 times the amount that baby boomers do on fitness, while millennials spend around three times as much, the bank added.BAC Internal Data/Bank of America Global ResearchYoung people's affinity for health and wellness is also evident in alcohol spending, with more Gen Zers and millennials shifting away from drinking in recent years. Spending growth for non-alcoholic beer and seltzers has outpaced spending growth for the alcoholic version of those beverages for the last four years, BofA data shows.Nielsen/Bank of America Global ResearchInterest in certain wellness trends has also increased. Google search volume for \"cold plunge\" and \"red light therapy\" soared throughout 2023 and 2024.Google Trends/Bank of America Global ResearchHere are the top three wellness stocks Bank of America sees benefitting as Gen Z and millennials invest in their health:Life Time Group Holdings (LTH)Current price: $30.04Performance year-to-date: +34.17%What the analysts say:Life Time is seeing the strongest growth among millennial and Gen Z users on its app. Monthly active between the ages of 18 and 44 grew 60% in 2024, according to Sensor Tower data cited by BofA.The company has also performed well in past recessions. During the downturn of 2008, the company saw its profit margins rise, according to the bank's analysis.\"We believe the company is particularly well positioned to take advantage of shifting wellness, fitness, and leisure trends with current strategy aligned to the fastest growing trends,\" analysts said, pointing to LTH's pickleball and cold plunge offerings.Planet Fitness (PLNT)Current price: $95.89Performance year-to-date: -3.72%What the analysts say:Card spending growth at Planet Fitness has outpaced overall card spending at fitness centers since the start of 2023, according to Bank of America data.Planet Fitness's business also remained resilient through the 2008 recession. Same-store sales for the gym chain averaged around 21% through the downturn, on par with the years leading up to the recession, according to BofA's analysis of company filings.Sharkninja Inc (SN)Current price: $84.27Performance year-to-date: - 13.05%What analysts say:The company makes a variety of home devices and kitchen appliances, including a line of blenders popular with fitness influencers and health gurus.Social media engagement with Shark Home and Ninja Kitchen is up significantly on TikTok, according to BofA's analysis of comments, shares, likes, and video views on both TikTok accounts.The company looks on track to beat revenue estimates in North America by around 8% in the first quarter, according to Neilsen point-of-sale data cited by analysts.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Furst said investing and charitable giving are core habits he wants to instill in his kids.He has also set up 529 plans for each child and he and his wife live frugally to build wealth. This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 38-year-old Robert Furst, a senior VP at Merrill Lynch, a wealth management division of the Bank of America. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I was really fortunate to have amazing role models in my life, and I'm very intentional about being a role model for my kids.I joined Merrill Lynch in 2013. I provide wealth management advice to our clients, who include business owners, professional athletes, doctors, and lawyers.At my job, I've focused a lot on educating the next generation about finances. It's given me a cheat code for dealing with my own kids, who are six and four.Here are some of the key ways I've decided to teach my kids about financial literacy and how I'm planning ahead to set them up for financial success.Encouraging charitable givingI don't think my children are too young to learn about gratitude, compassion, and appreciation. If we start those habits early, they will stay with them for the rest of their lives.My kids save money in piggy banks for charitable giving. When they've accumulated enough funds, they'll choose, with a little guidance, where to donate those funds. At four and six, my wife and I want our kids to focus on saving for charities and helping the less fortunate.When my six year old turns seven and starts first grade, I'll introduce him to investing and we will explore what stocks he would want to create his first portfolio.My kids have a head start in life with two loving parents with good jobs. We've already started putting money away for college. I want to teach them that once a family has \"enough\" it is crucial to give back.Letting them try out investingMy dad worked in finance and would cut articles out of the Wall Street Journal for me to read. He treated me like his \"junior partner\" and talked to me about business decisions he made at work.When I got birthday money as a kid, I told my dad I wanted to invest it. He let me and this spurred my interest in the market. I saw the power of making a good investment.I'm planning to introduce my oldest child to investing soon. I want him to use his money to pick some companies to invest in, so he can feel the impact of decisions he makes. Nowadays, it's relatively easy to open a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account and let my children pick some stocks.I do a lot of investment coaching with the children of our clients. Once, a 12-year-old visited our office. We pulled the research reports for companies he'd picked and discussed what can indicate an advisable or ill-advised investment. By pulling research reports of companies he selected, the child felt heard and respected.The child learned financial terms associated with stock research, so next time he wants to do some digging, jargon will not be a barrier to entry. I absolutely intend to do this with my children.It's not about getting kids to have amazing returns. It's about getting them engaged. If they invest for long enough, they can also see the power of compounding. Time in the market beats timing the market.Teaching them the value of hard workI once asked my parents for a video game system, and my mom told me she wouldn't pay for it.I ended up working in a friend of my dad's factory doing simple jobs like packing boxes. Soon, I had enough money to buy myself the game system.I won't have my kids working in factories, but they do know that their parents value hard work. Sometimes, my children will ask why my wife or I have to work late. We let them know that we strive to provide a good life for the family and that we work hard to earn money to pay for food, our home, and their education. I want them to know that nothing is guaranteed in life.I intend to pay them for chores. It could be as simple as making their beds. That's not a high-value item, but it's worth something to me if my wife and I don't have to do it.Saving for their futureOne of my financial goals is to send both of my kids to college debt-free, so I set up a 529 plan as soon as they had Social Security numbers. A 529 is a tax-advantaged education investment account that can help a child to attend college without incurring debt.Each child has their own 529. This is important because my children are of different ages and I'll invest in their 529s in line with when they go to college. As we get closer to college, we'll lessen the risk level because the money will need to be spent sooner.I also want to accumulate enough wealth to give my children choices in life. If one wants to work in finance or tech, they may not need help from my wife and me. But if one of them wants to become a social worker, the financial rewards might look a little different.I don't want my kids to be held back from doing amazing work in the community for financial reasons. We want to support them so they can make that choice without worrying about the salary difference. Several families I have counseled help subsidize a child who worked diligently in a less lucrative career, and this is something I admired.We're planning for this by setting money aside and only buying what we need. We can afford to buy more luxury goods than we do, and that's by design.I'll probably tell my kids that we've got this money set aside for them when they're around college age. I don't want to tell them too early as I wouldn't want them to rely on it.Do you have a story to share about planning for your children's financial future?

        "description": "From jobless claims to airport traffic, there are signs the consumer will be just fine even as the mood darkens amid rising economic uncertainty. rblfmr/ShutterstockHard data shows that the US consumer remains strong despite downbeat sentiment, BofA says. Confidence has slipped amid macro uncertainty, but US shoppers will weather the bad vibes. Air travel, card spending, and tax relief data are among positives to watch.Consumer confidence is down amid mounting economic uncertainty, but there a signs that US shoppers will probably be just fine. According to Bank of America, hard data continues to shine a positive light on consumers, even as sentiment measures indicate that spirits are low.The Consumer Confidence Index cratered to a four-year low this week, raising concerns of a spending slowdown that could ultimately lead to a recession. Disappointing retail sales and lowered outlooks among big box retailers have also added pressure.Rising tariff rates, an immigration crackdown, and cuts to the federal government all account for economic uncertainty, BofA said.While these are headwinds, BofA analysts said there are five things that show consumers will weather the vibecession. Jobless claimsDespite sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, the labor market has stayed solid, with jobless claims returning to low levels after a late-February spike.\"Jobless claims among federal employees are elevated. However, they are down from a couple of weeks ago, and the numbers are too small to move the needle on the broader labor market,\" the bank said.Weekly initial jobless claims stood at 224,000 for the week ending March 22. That's below 225,000 expectations, Deutsche Bank said in its own note.Bank of AmericaRobust spendingThere's no sign that consumer spending is cracking, with total card spending per household up 1.5% annually in the week ending March 22, data from the bank shows.\"Paired with the recovery in retail sales in February, this suggests that the weakness in consumer spending in January was a blip, rather than the start of a broader slowdown,\" the note said.Tax refundsConsumer spending could see a boost in the near term as tax refunds provide a small windfall to many Americans.Refunds rose 5.3% year-over-year through March 26, suggesting that spending could pick up in this month's data.\"One caveat is that the pickup in refunds might be due to faster processing of returns this year: in that case, any refund bump in spending will get paid back over the next couple of months,\" the bank wrote.Bank of AmericaBalance sheet bufferBofA dismissed the idea that consumer savings are running flat, instead noting that the household assets-to-liabilities ratio jumped sharply above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.The rise of liquid assets, which include checking accounts and money market mutual funds, could serve as a meaningful cushion against inflation pressure that could pick up in the coming months, BofA said.Air travelAirport traffic, a data set that lags by just one day, climbed modestly in late March after flatlining since January. Air travel has returned to 2024 levels and is due for a bump in the coming weeks as consumers travel for the Easter holiday.Earlier this year, dimming airline outlooks fueled vibecession worries, and companies such as Delta were casualties of the worsening mood, with the stock down over 26% for the year.Bank of AmericaRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "More than 70% of fund managers surveyed by BofA said they expect to see stagflation in the global economy in the next 12 months. Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BIThere are few areas in the market where investors can hide in event of the worst-case economic scenario.Markets see a greater risk of stagflation, which could be even more challenging than a recession.A handful of sectors have outperformed the market in such a scenario, BofA said.Stock investors have grown concerned that the economy could soon experience a dire combination of low growth and high inflation, but Bank of America said there are a few areas of the market where they can take refuge.In a note to clients on Friday, analysts at the bank highlighted key tenets of their stagflation playbook. Such an economic scenario, which sparked a major economic downturn in 1970s, is thought to be even worse than a traditional recession, as high inflation would curtail rate cuts meant to stimulate the economy. The bank analyzed the performance of various stock sectors during stagflationary periods stretching back to 1957. Here are the five best-performing areas of the market analysts identified: 1. Communication servicesAnton Petrus/Getty ImagesAverage annualized growth during stagflation: 11%Gain over the S&P 500: 4 percentage pointsYear-to-date return: -3.52%2. UtilitiesAnton Petrus/Getty ImagesAverage annualized growth during stagflation: 11%Gain over the S&P 500: 3 percentage pointsYear-to-date return: 3.24%3. EnergyThe cooling towers of a nuclear power plantWlad74/Getty ImagesAverage annualized growth during stagflation: 10%Gain over the S&P 500: 3 percentage pointsYear-to-date return: 6.21%4. Consumer staplesStock image of a woman grocery shopping.d3sign/Getty ImagesAverage annualized growth during stagflation: 10%Gain over the S&P 500: 3 percentage pointsYear-to-date return: 1.66%5. HealthcareHispanolistic/Getty ImagesAverage annualized growth during stagflation: 10%Gain over the S&P 500: 3 percentage pointsYear-to-date return: 6.17%Real estate and financials also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 on an annualized basis during stagflationary periods. Industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and technology were the worst-performing sectors, underperforming the S&P 500 in average annualized growth by at least 2 percentage points.Investors are increasingly pricing in the possibility of stagflation in the coming year.Bank of America's fund managers survey found that 71% of managers said they expected stagflation to hit the global economy sometime over the next 12 months. The survey also found that money managers reduced their holdings of US stocks in record amounts the week of March 7 to March 13.Bank of America Global ResearchStrategists at firms including Stifel, BCA Research, and UBS Global Wealth Management have all raised concerns about stagflation in recent weeks.The warning calls grew louder last week when Fed policymakers indicated they are also eyeing the risk that inflation could trend higher than thought while growth slows more than expected in 2025. Fed officials lifted their median inflation forecast to 2.7%, up from the prior estimate of 2.5%. They also trimmed their median expectations for GDP growth to 1.7%, down from the prior 2.1% forecast.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "\"Global investors are not anywhere close to short US or global equities,\" Bank of America's Michael Hartnett said this week. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI\"Monster\" equity inflows show that investors are undeterred by tariff fears, Bank of America says.US equities saw the biggest weekly inflow of the year, the bank's Michael Hartnett wrote.\"Global investors are not anywhere close to short US or global equities,\" he said.If stock investors say they're panicked about an impending downturn, they're not putting their money where their mouth is. In the week through this Wednesday, US stocks notched the biggest weekly inflow of 2025, attracting $34.1 billion, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett said.The \"monster equity inflows\" suggest that investors aren't convinced by recessionary and bear market fears that have been mounting recently, he wrote on Friday. Concerns have grown amid the Trump administration's tariff policies, which have spurred fears of higher inflation and economic weakness.Though these same concerns have emerged in Bank of America's monthly Fund Manager Survey, Hartnett emphasized that investors' actions point to a different reality.Aside from the record weekly inflows, he also cited a heavy two-week surge of stock buying among the bank's clients.\"Global investors are not anywhere close to short US or global equities,\" he said.That much might not be obvious when glancing at major US indexes. Last week, the S&P 500 plunged into correction territory, having fallen 10% since hitting a record on February 19. The sell-off occurred amid rising tariff threats pushed by the White House against Canada and Mexico.While strong inflows might mean that these fears have been overblown, Hartnett noted that the market is showing sensitivity as it approaches April 2, which is the deadline for the next round of tariff announcements. Tactically, he cited that bonds and gold offer more security against the \"tariff pandemic.\"In the first quarter, two developments have likely has a bigger influence on stock investors, Hartnett said: the Department of Government Efficiency and China's DeepSeek AI.The first is a White House effort to reduce federal spending, which may be important to investors who have grown weary of Washington's high debt and deficit levels. But many have questioned DOGE's actions, with the department slashing down on US agencies and employees at a rapid pace.Meanwhile, the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI tool was an eye-opener for US tech investors, as it indicated that competitive AI could be developed more cost-effectively. Its emergence caused American mega-caps to capsize in January, and top AI names such as Nvidia continue to struggle amid higher competition from China. Read the original article on Business Insider",

Bakkt Holdings is blowing it all up and starting fresh. The digital asset and payments platform on Monday (March 17) suffered a major blow when Bank of America and Webull announced they would not be renewing their commercial agreements with the company. On Wednesday (March 19), after delaying twice, the digital asset and payments platform held its earnings call sharing the financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The big news? Bakkt signed a definitive agreement to get rid of its Trust custody business entirely, named a new co-CEO, and announced a pivot to “become a pure play crypto infrastructure company.” Webull, per a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), represented nearly three quarters (74%) of Bakkt’s crypto services revenue. “As we move forward to a pure play crypto ecosystem player, [the divesture] enables us to double down on our core offerings — providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity, and subject to applicable regulatory approvals, payment solutions,” said Andy Main, CEO of Bakkt. Main also announced the appointment of Akshay Naheta as co-CEO. “As we enter 2025, Bakkt is sharpening its focus on the future of crypto, leveraging our technology, market expertise and strategic partnerships to be in a position to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Our partnership with DTR [Distributed Technologies Research, founded by Naheta], combined with Akshay Naheta agreeing to joining as co-CEO, marks a pivotal moment by expanding our capabilities, and we believe will position us to be able to capture market share in the global stablecoin payments network,” he told investors on Wednesday’s call. The company’s stock remained relatively flat, hovering around $9, after dropping by 30% to start the week. There was no Q&A session following Wednesday’s earnings call. Read more: Bakkt Suffers Major Setback as Bank Partners Drop Platform Focus on Core Offerings Few companies have undergone as radical a transformation as Bakkt, which once sought to bridge traditional finance and digital assets through loyalty rewards and consumer-friendly crypto solutions, and is now pivoting to a focused strategy: becoming a full-fledged crypto infrastructure company. Bakkt has entered into a strategic partnership with DTR, a stablecoin payments platform. This collaboration aims to enhance Bakkt’s capabilities in the global stablecoin payments network. To concentrate on its core offerings, Bakkt has signed a definitive agreement to divest its Trust custody business to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). This divestiture allows Bakkt to focus on providing institutional-grade crypto trading, liquidity and, subject to regulatory approvals, payment solutions. Simultaneously, Bakkt is evaluating alternatives for its Loyalty business, a segment that once seemed integral. Whether through a sale or a full wind-down, the company is signaling to investors that its future is not in travel miles or gift card conversions but in digital asset markets, trading infrastructure and institutional-grade solutions. Bakkt’s Q4 2024 earnings report, including leadership changes and divestitures, tells a story of aggressive restructuring, divestitures, and a shift toward high-volume crypto trading. Bakkt reported total revenues of $1.797 billion for the quarter, an increase of 737.9% year over year. This surge is attributed to heightened crypto market activity and increased asset prices.​ Read more: Read also: The Stablecoin Market Is $220 Billion. Are Businesses Actually Using Them? Despite the revenue growth, Bakkt reported a net loss of $40.4 million for the quarter, an improvement of 48.7% year over year. The adjusted EBITDA loss also decreased by 66.3% to $6.4 million, reflecting the company’s efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs. Bakkt faces substantial headwinds. The nonrenewal of its Webull commercial contract, a key revenue stream, raises questions about its ability to maintain retail partnerships while shifting toward institutional business. Moreover, the company’s dependence on volatile crypto markets means that external shocks — regulatory crackdowns, liquidity crunches or security breaches — could impact performance. With revenue projections between $1.03 billion and $1.28 billion for Q1 2025, the company is betting on sustained crypto adoption and a deeper integration into the institutional space. Whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Bakkt is no longer a consumer-facing crypto startup, it’s aiming to become instead a serious player in the infrastructure that powers digital asset markets.

China's blistering stock market rally may face a correction.REUTERS/StringerChina's markets have been posting strong gains for weeks. But BofA warns there may be a correction.China's market rally looks similar to 2015's boom and bust cycle, BofA strategists say.At the time, China was trying to rebalance its economy, and Alibaba's NYSE IPO was a key moment for Chinese tech.China's stock markets have been a bright spot in recent weeks amid a bloodbath on Wall Street — but the rally may not last.Strategists at BofA Securities warned there may be a \"meaningful correction soon\" to the rally in Chinese stocks. They highlighted some \"fundamental similarities\" between the current cycle and China's stock market crash in 2015.BofA strategists said in their Monday note that the current rally in Chinese stocks is similar to the cycle a decade ago in terms of economic rebalancing, policy stimulus and reforms, and technological breakthroughs.In 2015, the Chinese government aimed to shift its export- and investment-oriented economy to one driven by consumption and services. Alibaba's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange was also a watershed moment for China tech.Similarly, stock markets in Hong Kong and China have posted strong gains in recent weeks following the breakout rise of DeepSeek, a cost-efficient Chinese AI model. Beijing is also boosting private consumption again.The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, or HSCEI, has risen 26% so far this year, while the MSCI China Index has risen 24%.In contrast, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all in the red this year.\"Performance of the HSCEI/MSCI China in the past 17mths trended closely to the trajectory a decade ago, making us worry that we might be approaching some correction soon,\" wrote BofA strategists.Some investors in China are nervous, wrote the analysts.\"People generally agree with our structural bullish view, but are reluctant to chase at this level,\" they wrote, citing an investor meeting in Shanghai last week.Some onshore long-only investors are worried about China's economy's lack of fundamental improvement in employment, deflation, and credit demand. They are also concerned that negative news, including Trump's tariffs and geopolitical tensions, has largely been overlooked.To be sure, China's stock markets are not just gaining due to DeepSeek's breakthrough moment. Investors concerned about US President Donald Trump's economic and trade policy changes have also been reallocating some of their funds into other markets, sending global equities rallying too.However, some analysts are wary about calling it a sustainable run because the US economy — the world's largest, accounting for about a quarter of global GDP —could dive and affect markets far beyond its borders.As Dario Perkins, an economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard wrote on Monday, \"make no mistake — a US recession would bring down the entire world.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "More than 70% of fund managers surveyed by BofA expect stagflation to hit the global economy in the next 12 months. AP Images / Richard DrewGlobal fund managers dumped a record amount of US stock during last week's sell-off, BofA found.The surveyed investors expressed pessimism around the global economic-growth picture.Stagflation was a commonly-cited fear, with expectations for the scenario at the highest since late 2023.As US stocks slipped into a 10% correction last week, investors were dumping shares at a record clip.Global fund managers reduced their allocations to US equities by the most ever between March 7 and 13, according to a Bank of America survey featuring 171 investors overseeing a combined $426 billion in assets.Bank of America says the rotation out of US stocks into international assets like eurozone, UK, and emerging-market equities was driven by concerns of an economic slowdown.BofA Global Fund Manager SurveyKey among investor worries is the possibility of stagflation, which involves a toxic mix of below-trend growth and persistently high inflation. It effectively ties the Fed's hands, leaving them unable to raise or lower rates in order to address either situation.71% of fund managers said they expected a stagflation to hit the global economy over the next 12 months, the survey showed.The main culprit in the stagflation narrative is Trump's trade war. After an initial boom period built around pro-business expectations, the luster has worn off, and investors and economists alike have started to fret about a global slowdown.The chart below shows how pronounced stagflation worry has become in recent months:Bank of America Global ResearchAnother common refrain in the fund manager survey was that US exceptionalism as we know it may be over. 69% of fund managers said they think US outperformance relative to the rest of the world has \"peaked.\"As such, following the record-sized allocation trimming last week, fund managers are now positioned 23% underweight the US equity market, the lowest since June 23.Bank of America Global ResearchBank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett do see the possibility of a near-term rebound in US stocks, with the S&P 500 potentially climbing past 6,000 in the second quarter if concerns about inflation and the trade war begin to subside. On the flip side if the economy tips into a recession, the bank says the S&P 500 could drop below 5,000.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The Clearing House’s RTP network launched in 2017. The FedNow Service, the central bank’s foray into real-time payments, debuted in the summer 2023. And yet real-time payments — while getting some serious global traction — still have a lot of runway left for consumers and businesses. Daniel Stanton, managing director and global head of Transactional FX at Bank of America, told PYMNTS in a recent interview that as banks move onto the real-time payment networks, bringing faster payments capabilities to corporate clients will be a long-term project. “It’s a journey that we’re undertaking,” he said, “and not only from the standpoint of a financial institution but in the FinTech arena as well. It’s a joint journey toward building out our capabilities and enhancing or even redesigning our infrastructures … to get out of the thought process of ‘9 to 5’ and to operate on a 24/7 wavelength.” Looking at the Long Term Over the long term, he said, real-time payments will become commonplace, reflecting the ways in which we exchange information — and the ever speedier ways in which we live. For enterprises working with Bank of America, said Stanton, the benefits of real-time payments lie in greater control over when their beneficiary is paid — and how they’re paid, which in turn means that the sender can better manage their working capital. Along with the growth in pay-to-card and pay-by-bank use cases, Stanton was quick to note that “RTP is not a solution looking for a problem,” which is a mindset the bank seeks to bring to its clients, especially when they examine the ways and means that they are going to have to reconfigure their workflows and back-end processes, with artificial intelligence (AI) in the mix to provide additional lines of defense in anti-money laundering (AML) and transaction monitoring. “The workflow,” he said, “is going to need to be modified not only to transact and to send information simultaneously, but also to receive and digest the information that is being provided in order to truly benefit from RTP’s transparency and speed.” Choosing Among the Use Cases There must also be the recognition that not all transactions need to be real time, he said, and partnering with a financial institution — such as Bank of America — can help firms determine the applicability of real-time payments for some use cases, but not others. Pay by bank, to name but one “type” of real-time payment, can be embedded at the point of sale or within an eCommerce experience, said Stanton, and pay to card can improve B2C interactions such as with the gig economy. “From a cross-border standpoint,” he said, payments “are inundated with friction. What we’re seeing in the global economy is that the user experience is paramount, and the RTP paves the way for additional value.” The same is true for cross-border commercial payments, where costs are streamlined and all parties know exactly where and when payments have been sent — and when they’ll arrive and settle. That level of transparency fosters loyalty between buyers and suppliers and helps them navigate foreign exchange (FX) volatility, said Stanton. Bank of America, for its part, has integrated its FX solutions into the real-time payments value chain to help improve supply chain dynamics. Real-time payments are already transforming tech, media and telecom companies, remittance providers and eCommerce as they digitize payouts. “There’s a level of instant gratification,” he said, that is desired by the bank’s clients and their own end customers, “and so we have to be there to meet that demand.” The post Bank of America Says Real-Time Payments Connect Businesses to Working Capital appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesBank of America is reinventing the role of the investment banking \"staffer.\" Staffers are traditionally midlevel employees tasked with doling out jobs to junior bankers.BofA is elevating the role by making it permanent and giving it to higher ranking staff.Bank of America is shaking up a long-standing investment banking tradition in its latest effort to prevent young bankers from burnout, Business Insider has learned.On Wall Street, the job of doling out tasks to entry-level bankers has traditionally rested with a handful of midlevel bankers widely referred to as \"staffers.\" A criticism of the staffer role is that the midlevel bankers assigned to the job have little incentive or power to protect young bankers who might be overworked.Bank of America is now giving the responsibility for junior banker workloads exclusively to members of its highest ranks: directors and above, according to a person with knowledge of the switch.

The role will also be permanent. (Traditionally, the staffer role is filled by senior associates or vice presidents on a rotating basis.)\"The change here is that they will no longer have anything but this job,\" the person said. \"Before you were doing two things, and now your role is to oversee the teams and to provide guidance and all that comes with that.\"The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the change on Monday.

        "description": "\"In a recessionary environment, we recommend infrastructure and back office application platform vendors, with more resilient spend,\" analysts at BofA said. Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BISoftware stocks could be a bright spot in tech amid growing recession fears, Bank of America said.Infrastructure and back office vendors are recommended if growth weakens, the bank said.Historically, it takes two to three quarters for a recession to impact software revenue.While the market's latest roller coaster ride has sent many top tech stocks spiraling, defensive investors can still find safety in one corner of the sector. Software stocks are an overlooked haven and could provide relief for for traders anxious about a coming downturn. That's according to Bank of America, which noted that the group has a history of staying resilient when the economy buckles.\"In a recessionary environment, we recommend infrastructure and back office application platform vendors, with more resilient spend (MSFT, ORCL, CCCS, and WDAY),\" the bank wrote on Wednesday.Fear of recession has risen in US markets amid the White House's tariff announcements and a string of disappointment economic updates. With the S&P 500 down 9% from its peak in February, top names in the tech trade have seen some of the biggest declines. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 briefly entered correction territory on Monday.Yet, software has a history of holding up in a weaker economic environment. During the 2008 financial crisis, the cohort did not suffer a revenue or billings slowdown until two to three quarters into the recession. To Bank of America, that's because it takes time for IT budgets to adjust downwards.\"For example, front office applications growth decelerated 9% in the 3rd quarter following the beginning of the recession (moving from 43% Y/Y growth in 2Q08 to 36% in 3Q08),\" the note said.What's more, tariffs are a direct risk to only a small subset of software. BofA expects e-commerce vendors to face the biggest threat, citing Shopify, Global-E Online, and BigCommerce as some of the most vulnerable stocks.But overall, BofA does not expect a recession and cited healthy signals in the software sector, and software's 18% drop since February 18 is well below the 27% average across previous corrections.\"We continue to believe that we are headed for stable, perhaps improving demand cycle through 2025,\" the bank said, noting that year-on-year revenue growth expectations of 13.4% in both the first and second quarter remain reasonable.BofA is not the first to view software as a bright spot in tech.Goldman recently highlighted that software is the only AI-exposed tech sector that has seen positive revisions to consensus estimates for 2026 sales.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Andy Sieg, head of Citi's wealth business.Merrill Lynch, Abanti Chowdhury/BIDipendra Malhotra is joining Citi as its head of wealth technology, Business Insider has learned.Malhotra spent 11 years at Morgan Stanley leading AI and tech for its wealth business.Citi's wealth business has been dragged down by its poor tech and operating platform.Citi's wealth boss, Andy Sieg, is bringing in a Morgan Stanley technology leader to strengthen the bank's offering in the ultra-competitive race to manage wealth clients' money.The bank has hired Dipendra Malhotra as head of wealth technology, according to a person familiar with the matter. Malhotra is joining Citi in late-May after 11 years at its rival, Morgan Stanley, where he led the bank's AI, machine learning, analytics, and data for its wealth management business.Improving technology and digital offerings within Citi's wealth management unit has been a top priority for Sieg, who Citi CEO Jane Fraser tapped in 2023 to turn the wealth unit around. Citibank has struggled with its tech over the years, a problem that has extended to its wealth business. An internal audit conducted by Ernst & Young estimated that it would cost the bank at least $500 million to fix its patchwork of tech systems, Business Insider reported last year.Still, it's an area where Sieg is hoping to gain some ground.Citi's technology and operating platform \"has been a limiting factor in this business,\" Sieg said at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference in February. He has confidence that Fraser's transformation initiative, and its focus on data quality, is fortuitous for his business, adding that \"we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way to put work\" for both clients and advisors.While at Morgan Stanley, Malhotra was responsible for developing and maintaining data, AI, and machine learning tech for its wealth business.

Malhotra is joining Citi in late-May after 11 years at its rival, Morgan Stanley, where he led the bank's AI, machine learning, analytics, and data for its wealth management business.Improving technology and digital offerings within Citi's wealth management unit has been a top priority for Sieg, who Citi CEO Jane Fraser tapped in 2023 to turn the wealth unit around. Citibank has struggled with its tech over the years, a problem that has extended to its wealth business. An internal audit conducted by Ernst & Young estimated that it would cost the bank at least $500 million to fix its patchwork of tech systems, Business Insider reported last year.Still, it's an area where Sieg is hoping to gain some ground.Citi's technology and operating platform \"has been a limiting factor in this business,\" Sieg said at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference in February. He has confidence that Fraser's transformation initiative, and its focus on data quality, is fortuitous for his business, adding that \"we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way to put work\" for both clients and advisors.While at Morgan Stanley, Malhotra was responsible for developing and maintaining data, AI, and machine learning tech for its wealth business.

        "description": "\"While unwelcome, volatility is common in semi stocks and does not always presage a fundamental shift,\" Bank of America said. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BINvidia's post-earnings drop dented hopes for a fresh AI rally, but two firms could revive the trade this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index fell 7.2% after Nvidia's results were met with tepid investor response. BofA expects earnings from Broadcom and Marvell to possibly drum up fresh excitement on Wall Street. Last week's post-earnings sell-off in Nvidia shares dashed investor hopes of a revived artificial intelligence trade, but earnings for two AI names this week could generate fresh enthusiasm. That's according to Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who highlighted Broadcom and Marvell Technologies' upcoming earnings reports as potential catalysts to watch, saying that they could \"re-energize interest\" in semiconductor names. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dropped 7.2% last week after Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report failed to meet Wall Street's highest expectations.Shares of the AI GPU maker entered a bear market correction last week, with the stock down 22% from its record high reached in early January.But Arya says investors should get used to the volatility, as these types of declines are normal.\"While unwelcome, volatility is common in semi stocks and does not always presage a fundamental shift,\" Arya said, adding that the semiconductor index has experienced 21 different 5% or more weekly declines since 2021 even as it cumulatively increased by 71%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's return of 59%.Arya ultimately sees the latest volatility subsiding, as the fundamentals are too strong to ignore.That dynamic could be on display on Wednesday and Thursday, when Marvell Technology and Broadcom are scheduled to report quarterly results. Arya sees both companies, which are among his top five picks for 2025, beating analyst earnings estimates and raising their full-year guidance.Arya's conviction in the AI stocks stems from the sky-high capital expenditure commitments from cloud companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, most of which will be spent on AI-related hardware.Additionally, Arya said the ongoing \"battle of AI chatbots\" benefits AI hardware makers, as it drives demand for training and inference chips, and as business models develop, should soothe investor fears about the return on high AI spending. Here's what Arya had to say about Broadcom and Marvell's upcoming earnings reports.Broadcom: \"We expect management to restress the $60-$90 billion long-term SAM in custom chips and networking, with growing engagement with new partners (we think OpenAI, Apple).\"Marvell: \"Recovery in telco, enterprise, and solid demand for AI chips by customer Amazon and continued growth in AI optics could drive upside to consensus. Separately we expect MRVL to grow with Amazon even in CY26 on continued participation in custom chip program.\"Arya rates Broadcom and Marvell at \"Buy\" with respective price targets of $250 and $150.Read the original article on Business Insider",
