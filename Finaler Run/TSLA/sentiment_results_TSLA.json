        "explanation": "The news highlights BYD's continued competitive pressure in the Chinese EV market, particularly with innovative features that challenge Tesla's dominance. The direct comparison of self-driving tech pricing (BYD's included versus Tesla's optional) creates negative sentiment as it underscores BYD's cost competitiveness and reinforces the idea that Tesla may be overpriced in that key market.\n```"

        "explanation": "The news item is a general market overview and only mentions Tesla in the title. While a \"higher open\" might indirectly benefit TSLA, the impact within 60 minutes is likely negligible and already priced into pre-market trading. No direct impact or significant surprise factor related to TSLA itself is present.\n```"

        "sentiment": "negative",
        "explanation": "The news highlights the potential negative impact of Trump's tariffs on Tesla due to its international supply chain and manufacturing operations. While the exact magnitude is uncertain, the headline's emphasis on \"hurting Elon Musk and Tesla\" and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs suggests a negative sentiment trigger for short-term traders, potentially leading to selling pressure within the next 60 minutes.\n```"

        "sentiment": "neutral",
        "explanation": "The article mentions Elon Musk's cost-cutting crusade alongside Trump's tax cut plan. While tax cuts are generally viewed as a positive for businesses, the mention of \"politically risky\" and \"cost-cutting\" creates ambiguity. This mixed sentiment, combined with the broad, indirect nature of the news and the lack of quantifiable data regarding TSLA specifically, makes a clear short-term price impact unlikely within the next 60 minutes.\n```"

        "explanation": "This news item focuses on Elon Musk's political activities, which has no direct or immediate impact on TSLA's revenue, costs, or operations (no direct impact identified). While some investors may have strong opinions on Musk's political involvement, it's unlikely to cause a significant price deviation in TSLA stock within the next 60 minutes.\n```"

        "explanation": "The headline mentions \"Elon Musk Made a Big Prediction,\" but without knowing the specific prediction, its magnitude, and surprise factor, it's impossible to gauge its short-term impact. The headline also refers to \"What History Says Happens to the Stock Next,\" which suggests a historical analysis rather than a direct, actionable event affecting TSLA in the next 60 minutes, thus leading to neutral classification.\n```"

        "explanation": "The title mentions \"20M-vehicle target pulled back,\" which is likely to trigger a negative knee-jerk reaction from short-term traders. While the Nvidia appearance and supplier strategies might be neutral, the \"pulled back\" target carries a high surprise factor and suggests a potentially less optimistic future outlook in the short term, prompting immediate selling pressure.\n```"
