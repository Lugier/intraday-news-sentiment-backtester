American Express is readying what it says is its largest-ever investment in updating its cards. [contact-form-7] The company announced Monday (June 16) that it was planning a “refresh” to its U.S. consumer and business Platinum cards, without offering details about the planned changes. More information will be released this fall, the announcement added. “Platinum Card benefits and services resonate across generations, particularly with Millennial and Gen Z who accounted for 35% of total U.S. consumer spending last quarter,” Howard Grosfield, group president for U.S. consumer services at American Express (Amex), said in the announcement. “We’re going to take these cards to a new level, not only in what they offer in travel, dining and lifestyle benefits, but also in how they look and feel, to meet the evolving needs of our customers,” Grosfield added. Earlier this year, Amex predicted that Gen Z and millennial consumers would continue to drive growth, due to these age group’s higher average FICO scores and lower delinquency rates compared to wider industry benchmarks. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” American Express Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said during an April earnings call. While these younger consumers tend to spend about 20% less overall than older generations, their spending is growing at a swift clip, especially in international markets, with the company reporting a 22% year-over-year jump in overseas spending. Amex also noted that younger consumers tend to revolve balances less often, though that trend does not appear to be hurting revenue. Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about efforts by FinTech companies to attract Gen Z consumers. This age group prefers FinTechs to traditional banks, with 54% of them relying primarily on non-traditional financial service firms, according to PYMNTS intelligence research. This has left financial institutions from FinTechs to large banks and credit unions, finding themselves rethinking strategies to appeal to Gen Z. “They want products aligned with their values, aligned with their lifestyle, and they want to be digitally present,” said Gavin Michael, CEO of digital-only Varo Bank, during a recent panel discussion with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. For Varo, serving Gen Z involves flexibility and transparency through products such as Varo Advance, which offers short-term cash advances, as well as an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered line of credit. “We’re underwriting these products based on cash flow, not traditional credit histories,” Michael added, stressing tailored solutions that match Gen Z’s lifestyle demands.

Lithic has expanded its card issuing platform to enable FinTechs operating in the United States to issue cards on the American Express network. This addition unlocks a new network option for FinTechs looking to launch debit, credit and prepaid cards, Lithic said in a Wednesday (May 14) press release. “By empowering FinTechs to issue cards on the American Express network, our customers now have a differentiated product choice that can deliver exceptional value to their users,” Lithic CEO Bo Jiang said in the release. Lithic’s application programming interface (API) gives companies an easy way to integrate the creation and configuration of virtual cards into their business processes, Jiang told PYMNTS in an interview posted in 2022. Companies use these cards for things like insurance claims disbursements, working with online travel agencies to fulfill flight and travel purchases, issuing incentive payments and enabling employees to use the cards for disbursements, Jiang said at the time. “Many of the companies we work with today are ones that you don’t actually think of as card and payment companies,” Jiang said in the 2022 interview. Lithic added this capability by joining American Express’ Agile Partnership Network, which helps companies launch payment products and capabilities on the Amex network, Will Stredwick, senior vice president and general manager of global network services for North America at American Express, said in the release. “Working with Lithic is aligned to our continued strategy of delivering seamless, scalable and innovative payment solutions to more customers, in more ways,” Stredwick said. Marqeta Interim CEO Mike Milotich said in February that Marqeta, a card issuing platform, leveraged the Agile Partnership platform to make the American Express network “a new option for credit and debit card programs” in joint efforts that would begin later this year. “Offering American Express will further widen the choices on our platform to differentiate and provide even more options to FinTech and embedded finance partners and prospects,” Milotich said at the time. “We have signed an agreement … leveraging the American Express Agile Partnership platform, which enables FinTechs and other partners to launch cards on the American Express network.” The post Lithic Expands Card Issuing Platform to Include American Express Network appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The four financial services companies that reported results Thursday (April 18) — KeyCorp, Truist, American Express and Fifth Third Bancorp — faced investors against a backdrop of fresh tariff headlines, stubborn inflation and a rate path that is anything but clear. Yet the collective tone was anything but gloomy. From commercial-payments pipelines to premium card spend, executives struck a surprisingly upbeat note on the resilience of customers and the durability of their own balance sheets. Across all four calls, deposit bases expanded or at least held firm despite the most competitive rate environment in two decades. KeyCorp logged mid‑single‑digit deposit growth year over year, while Truist edged balances higher and pared its deposit costs by 10 basis points. Fifth Third highlighted its Southeast branch expansion — part of a strategy to lock in “granular operational funding,” as CEO Tim Spence put it. Credit quality remained equally sturdy. Key’s nonperforming assets fell nearly 10% from the prior quarter, Truist’s provision for credit losses slipped sequentially, and Fifth Third touted concentration limits that diversify risk “across asset classes, industries and regions.” That stability, executives said, allows them to keep leaning on higher‑margin fee lines such as commercial payments, investment banking and premium card fees to drive revenue even if loan growth stalls. Amex Gets Gen Z Nowhere was spending strength more visible than at American Express. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said travel bookings hit an all‑time high last quarter, a sign the company’s affluent base is still prioritizing experiences. Card member spending rose 6% year over year (7% excluding the leap‑year day), and Gen Z and millennial spend grew even faster, powered by what Squeri called “financially disciplined new professionals” who revolve balances less often but swipe frequently for points and perks. The picture looks different but still encouraging inside the banks. Truist’s mobile app originated 31% more consumer loans than a year ago, with Gen Z volumes up a striking 47%. At KeyCorp, CEO Chris Gorman said household relationships rose 2% and commercial payments momentum “remains strong,” although he did acknowledge that some clients have paused discretionary transactions while they size up tariff fallout. Fifth Third’s pulse check with 50 middle‑market CEOs revealed another twist: Even domestically sourced companies expect to lift prices, both to offset tariffs and to cushion potential volume losses abroad. Taken together, the data suggests that U.S. consumers are still spending — but spending selectively. Premium travel, digital lending and everyday payments are holding up, while big new projects are inching forward more cautiously. Investment Engines Keep Running Management teams are not letting the macro fog derail their own capital plans. Truist switched on real‑time payments during the quarter and grew treasury‑management revenue at a double‑digit clip. KeyCorp continues to “name‑by‑name” review clients for tariff exposure, but Gorman said existing capex projects remain “full speed ahead.” Fifth Third is pouring money into Southeast branches and national loan‑origination platforms, betting that demographic shifts and faster payments will reward scale. Despite their optimism, each institution sketched out a contingency plan should the economy stumble. KeyCorp set aside an extra $8 million in loan‑loss reserves and is running a bottoms‑up review of its largest borrowers. Truist trimmed professional‑services and equipment expenses yet continued to finance risk‑management and digital initiatives — a “transformation within flat revenue,” as executives described it. Fifth Third is “running the balance sheet defensively,” emphasizing optionality so it can “react quickly as conditions change,” Spence said. The common message: Keep liquidity abundant, credit underwriting tight, and technology spending pointed at areas that either cut cost (digital onboarding) or expand fee income (real‑time payments, commercial cards). If the tariff picture brightens, banks are positioned to accelerate; if it darkens, they have the reserves and operating leverage to endure. Why the confidence? Partly because unemployment is still low and delinquency metrics are benign. Partly, too, because these institutions have spent the past several years reshaping client books toward higher‑FICO consumers, high‑quality corporate borrowers and fee‑based products that cushion net‑interest‑margin swings. American Express, for example, noted that 70% of new accounts carry annual fees, while KeyCorp and Truist highlighted growing wealth‑management and treasury businesses whose revenues are less cyclical than spread income. Still, all four leaders acknowledged that geopolitical and policy wildcards could hit sentiment overnight. “We’re fifteen days into these tariffs,” Key’s Gorman observed. “The economy is in a period of great uncertainty. … Our business is doing well.” That juxtaposition — candid about risk but bullish on their own preparedness — ran like a thread through every call. Ultimately, this earnings slate shows a sector betting that disciplined balance‑sheet management and targeted technology bets will outlast the latest macro scare. No one embodied that stance better than American Express’s Squeri, who told investors: “I’m not going to pass up good opportunities to invest for the future just to hit a number.” It is a line that could have come from any of Thursday’s presenters and one that captures the guarded but genuine optimism now guiding the nation’s largest payments and banking franchises.

If the general attitude of global business is based on economic uncertainty, American Express (Amex) never got that email. The company is greeting the balance of 2025 with optimism, even as many of its peers and the broader business community gird themselves for economic turbulence. While much of Wall Street frets over fluctuating consumer confidence and the specter of rising unemployment, American Express executives see enough stability in spending, particularly among its affluent and younger customer segments, to hold firm on healthy revenue and earnings targets. Amex Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri underscored the company’s confidence by reiterating full-year guidance of 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50. He acknowledged the continuing uncertainty in global markets but emphasized that American Express’ projections already factor in a potential peak weighted average unemployment rate of around 5.7%. That figure, he noted, gives the company enough leeway to weather potential macroeconomic headwinds. CFO Christophe Le Caillec said that Amex’s core strengths, particularly its fee-based model and premium customer base, have remained robust through the year’s first quarter. While Q1 was the subject of pessimistic projections from analysts, earnings season has so far shown surprising stability. A point of keen interest for analysts has been the notion of a consumer “pull forward,” wherein some fear that travel and big-ticket purchases made in late 2024 or early 2025 could artificially inflate first-quarter numbers. Squeri was unequivocal in allaying these concerns. “We really haven’t seen any pull forward at all,” he told investors in an earnings call. “From a consumer perspective, we’ve seen no pull forward at all.” Squeri pointed out that spending in January, February and March, as well as the first half of April, has been consistent, with only minor fluctuations from month to month. He also noted that high-income earners are continuing to spend on travel, a key category for Amex. “We had the highest number of travel bookings that we’ve ever had,” he said, attributing this in part to pent-up demand but also to a broader trend of consumers prioritizing experiences and leisure. Even small business clients, who have reported incremental increases in wholesale and other expenditures, have not shown the kind of one-time burst analysts might associate with a “pull forward” phenomenon. Gen Z and Millennial Spending Resilience Amex has long viewed Generation Z and millennials as critical growth drivers. Squeri reiterated that belief, citing both higher average FICO scores and lower delinquency rates compared to broader industry benchmarks. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” he said. Though this younger cohort typically spends about 20% less overall than older generations, its spending is growing at a swift clip, particularly in international markets, where executives reported a 22% year-over-year jump. The company also noted that younger consumers tend to revolve balances less often, but that trend does not appear to be dampening revenue. See also: 85% Of Gen Z Prefers Digital Payments to Cash Instead, Squeri and Le Caillec said, it points to a financially disciplined new generation of cardholders who use American Express cards for convenience, perks and points instead of as a fallback for everyday liquidity. Squeri suggested that this group’s robust spending patterns, despite headlines about student loan repayment and rising living costs, reflect American Express’ ability to attract upwardly mobile young professionals. Beyond generational breakdowns, Squeri stressed that American Express’ overarching customer base skews toward higher-income, more resilient cardholders. “If you look at our card base now versus our card base in 2019, it is more premium than it was at that point with higher FICOs,” he said. This premium positioning helps insulate the company, according to Squeri, against broad fluctuations in consumer confidence. Le Caillec reinforced that the company’s fee-driven model further buffers it from swings in consumer sentiment. Over the past few years, a significant portion of new accounts (around 70% this quarter) has been on fee-paying products. Meanwhile, American Express has successfully refreshed numerous card offerings, allowing the firm to raise annual fees only when it correspondingly enhances card benefits. In Squeri’s words: “We don’t raise fees indiscriminately. You raise fees when you add value.” Long-Term Focus Despite threats of recession, Squeri said that the company remains committed to long-term investment in technology, small-business solutions and new product refreshes. Squeri acknowledged that if the economy takes a severe turn, small businesses might feel the pinch first, but he stressed that the company would not abandon its forward-looking strategy. “I’m not going to pass up good opportunities to invest for the future just to hit a number,” he said, reflecting a willingness to absorb short-term volatility in service of building a more durable business. By the numbers, on an FX-adjusted basis, revenue rose 8% year over year — or 9% when factoring out the leap year impact — to $17 billion. Total Card Member spending also grew at a steady clip, up 6% (7% excluding the extra day), outpacing results across pivotal metrics such as customer retention, demand for premium products and credit performance. These figures not only match but, in many respects, surpass the levels seen in 2024. Given the stable spending and credit trends, and in light of current economic conditions, American Express is standing by its full-year forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50, the ranges first set in January. While those targets may be influenced by broader macroeconomic developments, the company said it remains focused on driving long-term growth by supporting its customers and colleagues, exercising disciplined expense management and selectively investing in its business.

I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it’s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size. ★",

Visa reportedly offered Apple about $100 million to get the tech giant’s credit card business, which is held by Mastercard. The offer came as the payment network and rival American Express are trying to win the Apple card business, and Mastercard is fighting to keep it, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (April 1), citing unnamed sources. Reached by PYMNTS, a Visa spokesperson said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. The Apple card business is in play because the bank behind it, Goldman Sachs, is exiting the consumer lending sector, according to the WSJ report. While Apple is looking for a new bank, it plans to select a payment network first, the report said. The payment networks are competing for the business because not only is Apple one of the biggest co-branded credit card programs — with about $20 billion in balances — but the company plays a growing role in many consumers’ payments and other financial needs, per the report. Apple debuted its credit card in 2019 in conjunction with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard, PYMNTS reported at the time. At launch, key features of the card included no fees, daily cash-back rewards, and the ability to sign up for the card with an iPhone in the Wallet app and get the card within minutes, issued straight to the phone. It was reported in July 2023 that Goldman Sachs’ credit card partnership with Apple could be nearing an end, and that the banking giant was in discussions with American Express to take over the credit card and other collaborations between Goldman and Apple. Goldman had announced plans in late 2022 to scale back its consumer banking offerings, though its agreement with Apple remained untouched at the time. In January, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Barclays and credit card issuer Synchrony Financial to replace Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said at the time that while the bank had a contract with Apple to run the partnership until 2030, there was a possibility that it could end before then. The bank was narrowing its strategic focus and exiting some businesses. The post Report: Visa Offers $100 Million to Get Apple Credit Card Business appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

As Affirm CEO Max Levchin told Karen […] The post Affirm’s Levchin Sees Company Becoming the American Express of Buy Now, Pay Later appeared first on PYMNTS.com. The lure of paying over time lies with the predictability of the repayment. Consumers don’t think of pay later options as credit, at least not in the traditional sense. They see a finite timeline over weeks or months, and a point at which all has been paid off. As Affirm CEO Max Levchin told Karen Webster in a discussion featured during the Pay Later Unpacked event held by PYMNTS On Air, “the sense of clarity of when [payments] start and end is powerful… The appeal of pay later is not that it’s some cool way of borrowing money. It’s the sense of control around the schedule and the plan that you create.” There’s also appeal for merchants, who want to boost their conversion rates. In terms of customer-centric costs, merchants can spend more than 30% of gross sales just to get customers’ attention, Levchin said. Once consumers arrive at the checkout counter, whether virtual or brick-and-mortar, merchants want them to pull the trigger and close the sale. The 13-Year-Old Startup Thirteen years into its journey of still thinking like a startup, Levchin’s Affirm is tied to merchant sites and has been embedded in commerce and digital wallets. The company has its own merchant marketplace, a financial services platform and a discovery platform for merchants to enable 0% financing offers. “We’re a payments network,” Levchin said, adding that “we are, today, in the world of network comparable like American Express … I’ve often compared Affirm to a sort of aspirational Amex. We want to be thought of as the company that stands behind the consumer in a way that goes above and beyond.” The competitive landscape is growing ever crowded as, for instance, banks enter the pay later fray, and with a nod to the fact that banks may have a distribution advantage, Levchin said Affirm can “move at 10 times the speed of any bank.” Beyond the banks, one can find pay later across a broad range of checkouts, which has been gaining momentum through the past half-decade, he said. What was once an interesting idea is now part of the standard package offerings of commerce at the point of sale. “This is no longer optional,” Levchin said. “There has never been a monopoly in payments, and we want the market to be competitive… The fact that traditional bank card issuers are waking up to the power of these fixed-term plans” helps drive awareness and adoption. By the Numbers There’s a tailwind in the fact that young consumers are eschewing credit cards, said Levchin, who added that they’re skeptical of taking on long-term, and possibly unmanageable, debt. For Affirm, the proof lies in the numbers. “We’ll do $35 billion this fiscal year, and the 20-plus million active users speaks for itself,” he said. Repeat purchases are accelerating as recurring behavior refutes the notion that pay later options simply gain on the heels of new accounts and first-time users who may be overextending themselves. Levchin also pointed to the fact that merchants benefit from increased conversion rates as cart abandonment rates plummet 28% and cart purchases increase 60% (as measured in dollars) when Affirm’s pay later options are in the mix. Affirm is cannibalizing credit card transactions from banks, Levchin said. “The stratification of our offerings is very clear,” said Levchin, who added, “We’re not the least expensive [options for merchants], and we don’t compete on price. We complete on being able to say yes more often by driving higher conversions and taking good care of the customer… We don’t charge them late fees.” That model is a moral one, with steady and transparent merchant fees, in contrast to the money that is made by competitors on late fees and other charges that stack up when, as Levchin said, consumers are paying the least attention. Affirm’s app also lets users see their purchasing power at any given time, and feedback conveyed to consumers can help them decide whether a purchase is too large or may take too long to pay back (and requires a down payment), he said. The Affirm Card Levchin has said in presentations and on analyst calls that the “Affirm Card is the best manifestation of how to use Affirm.” Simple math offers insight into the economics of capturing 20 million users, whose average household income stands at $75,0000 — and 10% of that, at $7,500, is a reasonable share of spending that could make its way onto those cards connected to third-party accounts. Grocery remains a key area of spending on those cards, although paying over time can just as easily cover a $2,000 meal in Las Vegas or even a medical procedure. Looking ahead, Affirm will allow other issuers onto its network, and through its February pact with FIS, the Affirm Card construct will be offered to any bank that wants to add pay later functionality to its debit cards. “Over time, we will look more and more like what Amex does today,” Levchin said. “You can get an Amex branded card from a bank that is not American Express.” Although the political and regulatory climate is uncertain at the moment, and the fate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has yet to be determined, there are still indications that regulators are curious about technology and its benefits in payments. From a macro and industry-wide point of view, Levchin told Webster that although he remains watchful, there are no signs of recession-like impacts hitting the portfolio — and the short-term (four-month) durations of the loans mean they are paid off quickly. “There’s a certain degree of natural accretion toward products like ours that happen in a more cautious consumer environment,” he told Webster, adding, “When there’s stress in the news and stress in the stock market, you want to know that the purchase is not going to put you under. Being able to say, ‘There’s a plan, and I know when the plan ends,’ is a nice feeling.” The post Affirm’s Levchin Sees Company Becoming the American Express of Buy Now, Pay Later appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Are the days of credit card users boosting the U.S. economy at an end? Share prices for four of the biggest credit card lenders — American Express, Discover, Capital One and Synchrony — are down an average of about 12% for the year, compared to a 4.5% drop in the overall S&P 500, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday (March 11). Americans’ inflation-adjusted debt has stretched beyond pre-pandemic levels, with the average household’s credit card debt surpassing $10,000 during the closing quarter of 2024. It’s the first time that figure has been reached since 2009, and it’s concerning investors, the report said. There are also concerns about rising delinquency rates, especially among high-income consumers. Between January 2023 and January 2025, late debt payments from people earning at least $150,000 per year more than doubled, according to the report. While those late payments account for a fraction of all outstanding balances, the increase outpaces upticks in late payments among middle- and low-income consumers, the report said. “We’re seeing heightened credit stress among high-income consumers,” VantageScore Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Economist Rikard Bandebo said, per the report, adding that the stresses are more pronounced for consumers without nest eggs. February data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that 11.35% of credit cards are more than 90 days overdue, a 17% jump from the previous year. These delinquency levels haven’t been seen since the fourth quarter of 2011. Meanwhile, the New York Fed warned of a decline in sentiment among consumers about their financial futures, following the release of the bank’s monthly consumer expectations survey. “Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago were mostly unchanged, but year-ahead expectations about households’ financial situations deteriorated considerably,” the Fed said this week. “The share of households expecting a worse financial situation in one year from now rose to 27.4%, the highest level since November 2023.” The post Consumer Credit Concerns Mount as Late Payments Climb appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

American Express is set to purchase expense management software firm Center. The deal is aimed at helping American Express (Amex) bolster its services for small businesses, according to a Thursday (March 6) news release. “As a leader in corporate and small business cards, it is our job to deliver innovative products and services that help customers run their businesses more efficiently,” Raymond Joabar, president for global commercial services at Amex, said in the release. “By integrating Center’s outstanding talent and technology, we can save our customers time and money and strengthen our leadership position in commercial card payments.” According to the release, Center’s software is designed to give businesses real-time visibility into employee spending, automating manual accounting tasks, streamlining expense submissions and reporting, and helping finance teams optimize decision making. PYMNTS explored some of Amex’s small to medium-sized business (SMB) efforts earlier this year in a conversation with Tessa R. Dooley, the company’s executive vice president of U.S. merchant marketing. She noted that small businesses need to balance customer demand and seamless operation. “It’s important that businesses make sure they’ve got the right technology in place to ensure that their front-end checkout experiences, as well as their back-end processes, are operating as efficiently and as effectively as possible,” said Dooley. She said operational agility and cutting-edge payment technologies can help SMBs succeed, meaning that offering multiple payment options has become a strategic imperative. The company says its research shows that surveyed merchants estimate that a third of their sales are made with digital payment options like mobile wallets and contactless payments. “Businesses should take a cue from these industry trends but also analyze their own customer data to tailor payment options that best meet their customers’ preferences,” Dooley said. “Offering different payment options to customers, especially during high sales periods like the holidays, can help give businesses a leg up on the competition.” In addition to payments, operational preparedness is crucial during busy seasons. SMBs need to streamline inventory management and simplify returns across multiple sales channels. “Prioritizing tools to automate and streamline your payment processes helps to make [a busy] sales period manageable,” Dooley said. “It can help businesses to manage their cash flow, save employees time that they might have spent on more manual processes, and help ensure that transactions stay secure.” The post Amex Acquires Center to Bolster Small Business Expense Management appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

In a world where so much is tailored to individual preferences, consumers have come to expect the same level of customization in retail. A survey conducted by American Express showed that 68% of retail consumers in the United States said they expect brands to provide personalized offers based on what they like. “Retailers really need to think about how they engage with their target audience if they’re looking to drive spend and loyalty in today’s environment,” Nyala Ward, vice president, Amex Offers Customer Success at American Express, told PYMNTS. Generic discounts and blanket promotions no longer cut it; shoppers demand offers that make them feel seen and reflect their unique buying habits. For retailers, this new customer standard can be difficult to meet, as 85% of U.S. retail decision-makers reported that one of their business’s biggest challenges is sustaining customer personalization at scale, according to the survey. However, Ward said it also presents retailers with an opportunity to drive deep engagement. “Gone are the days when you can just offer generic offers,” she said. “Those get lost in the shuffle and can even turn customers off from engaging with a retailer.” Consumers, especially Generation Z and millennials, expect hyper-personalized offers, seamless shopping experiences, and engagement that extends beyond checkout. If retailers aren’t keeping up, they’re getting left behind. The Next Generation of Consumers With digital-first solutions like Amex Offers, which generate personalized card-linked offers based on where and how card members spend, Ward said businesses can harness the power of data-driven, personalized promotions to reach Gen Z and millennials. Based on internal Amex data, Amex Offers drove 341 million U.S. card member offer enrollments and $9.8 billion in spending to U.S. merchants who ran on the platform. Amex’s data showed that 52% of Amex Offers redeemers in the U.S. were Gen Z or millennial card members. Using first-party transaction data helps these offers reach consumers at the right time, increasing their effectiveness. Amex Offers is an alternative to traditional advertising that can help retailers break through the clutter, Ward said. “It’s an opportunity to provide offers that are reflective of where and how customers spend,” which helps brands engage with shoppers in ways that feel meaningful and relevant to them, she said. However, creating a strong loyalty strategy goes beyond targeting — it requires understanding the evolving shopping habits of Gen Z and millennials. As Gen Z and millennials gain spending power and influence, they are increasingly important demographics for retailers, Ward said. They are digital natives who expect seamless, personalized and socially connected shopping experiences. Social media interactions, feedback forums and community-driven brand initiatives can be just as important as the products these groups purchase. “Gen Z and millennials want to be seen as individuals, and they’re the driving force behind the demand for personalization,” Ward said. Retailers that succeed in attracting this demographic will embrace a more holistic approach to loyalty, one that includes engaging digital experiences, sustainable practices and exclusive perks that go beyond discounts, she said. What the Future Holds for Loyalty As retailers look ahead, the next wave of innovation in loyalty programs will likely center around deeper personalization, greater integration of digital touchpoints and a more nuanced understanding of consumer behavior. Brands that can effectively use data while maintaining transparency and consumer trust will be best positioned for success, Ward said, adding she sees a major shift toward holistic brand engagement. The conventional marketing funnel, where consumers move from awareness to intent to purchase in a linear fashion, is quickly becoming obsolete. Today’s customer journey is far more fluid and dynamic. “A consumer can discover something that attracts them to a brand after they make a purchase,” Ward said. “Brand love doesn’t necessarily come before the purchase. It can come after.” Instead of seeing the transaction as the end goal, brands should focus on fostering ongoing engagement that keeps consumers coming back, via an omnichannel experience in-store and online. Platforms like Amex Offers help businesses achieve this by creating continuous touch points in the palms of their hands, she said. With this new model, success in retail is not just about securing the first transaction but about keeping the consumer engaged over time. The right offer, delivered at the right moment, has the potential to turn a one-time shopper into a lifelong customer, Ward said.
