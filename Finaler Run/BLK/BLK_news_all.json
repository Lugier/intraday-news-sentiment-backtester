It's helped many private equity bosses reach billionaire status in recent decades.\"Many financial services firms see alternatives as a key area of growth for the future,\" said Bryan Liou, managing director at Johnson Associates. \"They want to emphasize it, they want to signal to the market that they're serious about it.\"He pointed to BlackRock, known for its bonds and ETFs business. The $12 trillion asset manager has been expanding into real estate, infrastructure, and other alternative assets in an effort to diversify into private investments.Last year, BlackRock's board introduced a carried interest component to CEO Larry Fink's future pay for the first time, SEC documents show.Goldman Sachs also paid CEO David Solomon and other C-Suite executives a portion of their compensation through carry last year for the first time ever. BlackRock said it made the change to \"align CEO compensation with the evolution of BlackRock's private markets platform.\" Goldman, in an SEC filing, said the change will help it compete for talent with alternative asset managers.At both firms, carried interest payments were previously reserved for professionals who worked directly in private markets investing.

JPMorgan Chase plans to offer financing to clients using spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (June 4). [contact-form-7] The decision applies globally across both retail and institutional segments and reflects the bank’s growing acceptance of regulated crypto exposure in mainstream finance. Clients’ holdings in crypto ETFs will now count toward net worth and liquidity calculations, placing them alongside stocks and real estate in eligibility assessments. The move expands on JPMorgan’s prior case-by-case approach and follows similar digital asset initiatives from other banks, including Morgan Stanley. The change comes amid a broader shift in regulatory tone under the current administration. Spot bitcoin ETFs — approved in January 2024 — now collectively manage over $128 billion in assets, making them among the most successful ETF launches in U.S. history. The development also reflects a sharp pivot for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been publicly skeptical of bitcoin, only offering clients access to the cryptocurrency last month. Speaking at the firm’s investor day in May, Dimon said: “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it.” While JPMorgan does not currently offer custody or execution services for crypto ETFs, the new lending policy positions the bank to capitalize on growing institutional demand for digital asset integration. It also mirrors broader industry trends identified in PYMNTS’ latest coverage on how banks are shifting from zero crypto exposure to enabling new forms of digital asset utility.

Hildebrand added that \"sustained higher growth would be the best way to deal with the debt and deficit problems in combination with reasonable budgetary policy”. In an interview on The Pulse with Francine Lacqua, Hildebrand said \"the last thing you want is questions around the sanctity of the sovereign signature”. When Moody’s Ratings downgraded the US in the middle of May — becoming the last of the three big credit rating companies to lower its ratings from the highest level — it warned that the US's fiscal deficit, government debt and interest burden would all rise over the coming years, the latest sign of growing fears about Washington’s fiscal position.

        "description": "As the Trump administration funnels money into fossil fuels and the country largely retreats on climate efforts, New York City is trying to ensure its pension funds take the climate into consideration. In 2021, New York City officials announced that the city’s pension funds divested an estimated $4 billion from fossil fuel companies, a landmark move in the effort to divest money from polluting industries. But divesting directly from these companies only covers a small portion of how the markets support the continued development of oil, gas, and coal. Major asset managers like BlackRock still invest in fossil fuels; so if a pension fund is invested in BlackRock, it’s still essentially funneling money into oil, gas, and coal. Now, those asset managers will have to show the city that their investments align with New York’s climate goals, or they could risk losing the pension funds’ business. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander recently announced new climate standards for pension fund asset managers, including clear net-zero goals that decrease their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Asset managers have until June 30 to submit their climate strategies to the city. Officials will evaluate those net-zero plans to ensure that they’re “real and actionable.” If an asset manager’s plans fail to meet those climate standards, they’ll be sent to a “rebid” process, meaning they’ll have to bid again for the pension funds’ business, and the funds could then move their money to a different, cleaner asset manager. As part of any new bidding process, Lander will recommend evaluating an asset manager’s corporate-level climate behavior as well. “What we’re doing is getting the New York City pension funds to use their buying power to shift money from dirtier money managers like BlackRock, who are bad on climate, to cleaner money managers,” says Pete Sikora, climate campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, a nonprofit that campaigned for these new standards. Activists hope that by taking business away from the less climate friendly asset managers, those companies will be forced to clean up their portfolios in order to get back the pension funds’ business. New York City’s five pension funds have nearly $300 billion worth of investments, with a few hundred asset managers. The largest is BlackRock, which holds nearly $60 billion of the funds’ investments. (In total, BlackRock has more than $11 trillion in assets under management.) The city’s pension funds include the New York City Employees’ Retirement System (NYCERS), Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS), and Board of Education Retirement System (BERS), which have all historically been progressive on climate action; TRS is also the largest investor with $109 billion in assets. (The other two funds are the New York City Police Pension Fund and the New York City Fire Pension Fund.) Already, since 2019, New York City’s pension system has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37%. It aims to be net-zero by 2040. This move to require climate plans from asset managers—and to stop investing with them if their climate plans aren’t strong enough—is crucial to reaching that goal, Sikora says. It’s a more impactful move than just divesting directly from fossil fuel companies, he notes, “because it pushes the entire financial industry” to be cleaner. “There’s no way to stave off global climate catastrophe unless finance as a whole flees from oil, gas, coal, and deforestation,” he says. The move is also a direct response to the Trump administration’s efforts to funnel money into the fossil fuel industry, and to push back the entire country’s climate progress. “We will not retreat from our strong climate action, a position that remains consistent with our fiduciary duty. Climate risk is financial risk,” Lander said in a statement. “Some may cave to the Trump administration and reverse their climate commitments, but we will not be deterred from jointly prioritizing our climate goals and financial responsibilities.” (Lander is running to be the Democratic candidate in New York City’s mayoral race, and has made “standing up to Donald Trump” a tenet of his campaign.) New York Communities for Change has been advocating for these climate standards for years, Sikora says, and was talking to Lander about the possibilities before he was even elected as comptroller in 2021. Before that role, Lander was on the city council, where he sponsored a resolution calling on BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase, Liberty Mutual, and other financial institutions to stop lending to and investing in the fossil fuel industry. That hinted to activists that he would be supportive of these efforts. Though this effort was years in the making, it’s becoming more urgent as the financial industry backslides on climate commitments at large. In January 2025, weeks before Trump took office, six major banks left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a group that was setting net-zero targets for the financial world. Still, some funds are trying to hold banks to account. In February, the People’s Pension, one of the United Kingdom’s largest pension funds, said it was “prioritizing sustainability” by pulling a majority of its money out of State Street; the fund moved £20 billion to a different asset manager, Amundi, which it says has stronger climate standards. Changes to New York City’s pension funds won’t happen immediately, though. After asset managers submit their climate plans to the city, officials have to review them before they make recommendations on whether to put the business up for rebid; those recommendations will likely start to happen in the summer or early fall. New York City’s move to divest its pension fund from fossil fuels did face a lawsuit from oil and gas companies in 2023; in 2024, the city won. These additional climate requirements may also face criticism or legal pushback, particularly from the Trump administration, but Sikora is confident it will hold up in court. Investing in fossil fuels is no longer a sure route to profitability; thousands of oil and gas assets are at risk of becoming stranded—meaning they would be unprofitable or forced to shut down years before planned—because of the impacts of climate change. “New York City pension funds have an interest in a healthy world,” he says. “You don’t have New York City pension funds in a dead New York City that is submerged under rising seas. . . . On a basic, prudential level, you shouldn’t be furthering your own destruction with your investments.”",

        "description": "\"I've never seen markets move to such extremes,\" says BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Rick Rieder, BlackRock Managing Director, Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income.Heidi Gutman/CNBCRick Rieder sees bond market volatility as an opportunity amid economic policy shifts.He said short-duration Treasurys offer attractive yields as rate-cut expectations adjust.European high-yield bonds are also appealing due to lower volatility and favorable currency swaps.It's been a particularly busy start to the year for BlackRock's bond chief Rick Rieder — not that someone overseeing $3 trillion in assets has all that much spare time to begin with.The economic policy uncertainty that President Donald Trump has introduced has sent the bond market flailing in a way Rieder hasn't seen before. But the volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing.\"There is change afoot,\" Rieder told BI. \"One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static.\"\"The reaction function to any piece of news can be really extreme,\" he continued. \"So markets go through these periods of illiquidity, and it just presents these great opportunities that, by the way, may only be there for 10 minutes, or an hour, or a day. But I've never seen markets move to such extremes.\"Rieder shared a few of those opportunities he's leaning into at the moment in his iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC), which yields 6.6% and has grown to $9 billion in assets since launching in May 2023.One of them is the front end of the yield curve, or short-duration Treasurys.Yields on the 2-year note had fallen from 4.3% last year to 3.6% in April as investors started to price in as many as five rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But as rate-cut expectations have fallen, yields have risen back close to 4%, making them more attractive.Front-end bonds also offer a hedge for economic volatility in the short term, allowing investors to clip a robust coupon that they're not locked into for too long. The long end of the curve, meanwhile, isn't acting as a recession hedge right now, Rieder said, with investors worried about inflation from tariffs and rising yields thanks to ballooning fiscal spending deficits.\"I'd rather keep yield up and not have to worry about the volatility,\" Rieder said.\"The long end is not a hedge,\" he continued. \"Its traditional offsetting risk function doesn't work today, and so until yields move significantly higher I don't see any significant reason to own longer in interest rates.\"Long-end rates in Europe, however, are more attractive, Rieder said. He said he's betting on European B and BB-rated high-yield bonds to deliver higher yields. This is because economic growth is slowing to a greater degree in Europe than in the US, and inflation is more tame, so the European Central Bank is likely to cut rates more aggressively. This has meant limited upside volatility for European rates. For example, while 10-year Treasury yields have surged from 3.99% to 4.43% since April 4, 10-year Eurozone bond yields have been virtually flat, falling by just three basis points from 3.13% to 3.1%. When yields rise, bonds lose their value, and vice versa.\"Taking some of your interest-rate risk in Europe versus the US — particularly versus long US — has been an exciting thing to be involved with,\" Rieder said.\"Usually, US and European rates move together,\" he continued. \"Now you're seeing historic movements of European rates relative to the US, meaning European rates are much more stable.\"Plus, the dollar's weakness relative to the euro is icing on the cake.\"Because of the cross-currency swap, you could buy Europe and you get a couple of percent of additional yield,\" Rieder said.To mitigate the downside risk of some of the higher-yield bonds in his portfolio, Rieder pairs them with high-quality assets like AAA collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), he said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "While policy headwinds for renewable power stocks are strong, BlackRock argues they're priced in, and that the US needs power from all sources to fuel AI. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesBlackRock is betting there's upside ahead for renewable and clean energy stocks.Energy demand will make clean energy essential for the US.Risks related to tariffs and policy are priced into the market, the firm said.US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space.First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever.\"The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs,\" BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand.\"In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024.Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks.\"Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,\" BlackRock wrote. \"Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think.\"BlackRockBlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.\"Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers,\" BlackRock wrote. \"But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

The financing, from SJF Ventures, will help Tradeverifyd invest in its go-to-market team to meet the demand for its agentic artificial intelligence-powered solution, the company said in a Wednesday (May 21) news release. “Global supply chains are experiencing significant disruption due to tariffs, increased regulatory scrutiny and environmental events,” David Griest, managing director at SJF Ventures, said in the release. “We’ve been tracking the company for some time; Tradeverifyd stands out for its ability to identify and mitigate supply chain risks, ensure compliance and enhance resilience for enterprise customers.” Tradeverifyd is used by several of the largest global enterprises, as well as government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to the release. Among its offerings is the “Tradeverifyd Score,” which measures a supplier’s ability to successfully fulfill orders, functioning like a credit score for supply chain reliability. Supply chain reliability is an open question these days, according to the May PYMNTS Intelligence report “Tariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play.” The report found that more than half of service firms are now expecting supply chain disruptions for the companies with which they work and 64% anticipate higher material costs. “Whether you’re an importer of mattresses or a consulting firm advising that importer on retail and wholesale strategies, you’re probably not sleeping well,” PYMNTS wrote May 5. “Services, including those sold by consulting, law, accounting and financial services companies, made up more than 72% of GDP in the last three months of 2024…” The chief concern for these firms is supply chain strain. Almost 90% of goods firms expect shipment delays or supply disruptions. Most also expect to pay higher raw material costs, increases that would be passed on to consumers, who might not be willing to pay more. In addition, 68% of the companies surveyed expect difficulty exporting their goods due to retaliatory tariffs from China, and possibly other countries.

        "description": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday.Brendan McDermid/ReutersBig-name US investors like BlackRock's Larry Fink and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman spoke Tuesday in Riyadh.The managers talked up Saudi Arabia's local economy while acknowledging market volatility globally.The panel took place at the Saudi-US Investment Forum, held in conjunction with President Donald Trump's visit.On a panel of billionaires and high-powered CEOs in Riyadh, the competition was not about who has the most assets under management, the best returns, or the swankiest private jet.Instead, the friendly back-and-forth was focused on who had visited Saudi Arabia the most and the date of their first visit to the Middle East country.BlackRock's Larry Fink boasted of coming more than 65 times over several decades. Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman said he first came to the country in 1991 when most of the roads were unpaved. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson admitted she was late to the party — her first visit was in 2020 — but said she has made up time by coming on 15 different occasions since.\"It's always a wonderful time to be back in the Kingdom,\" fellow panelist Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citi, said.The event was one of many at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh on Tuesday; the forum is being held in conjuction with President Donald Trump's state visit to the Kingdom, which said at the start of the president's second stint in the White House that it would invest hundreds of billions in the US.American investors, meanwhile, are looking to put capital to work in the Middle East.Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager and is increasingly focused on private market investments in areas like infrastructure, said Saudi Arabia has become a capital \"destination\" instead of just a capital provider for foreign investors.\"The emphasis on 2030 was really a statement to the world that we're going to do it ourselves,\" Fink said about the country's sovereign wealth fund's plan to diversify and grow different parts of the economy.Fraser said the next step for the country's capital markets would be to build a treasury function. Johnson boasted about her firm's new local private credit offering.\"We could see the Kingdom being a top 10 economy in the world,\" Fink said of a country that produced $1.1 trillion in GDP last year — less than half of what Canada, the world's tenth-largest economy, generated in 2024.The optimism for the country's future did not take away from the general uncertainty many finance leaders have expressed about the immediate future, thanks to the Trump administration's tariff policies, though the recent agreement with China has provided hope that the new global trade landscape will be clearer soon.The bigger fear expressed by Fink is not short-term volatility — \"I don't really care about the next 90 days,\" he said — but instead a continued reliance on public funding for long-term projects.The \"vitality\" of any economy, he said, is measured by the amount of private capital flowing to investments that will take years to complete.So far, those who have invested in public-private partnerships in Saudi Arabia are pleased. Schwarzman said his firm's $20 billion in 2018 from the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund has generated annual returns of 17.5%.\"We have a lot of happy friends,\" the billionaire said with a wry smile.Read the original article on Business Insider BlackRock CEO Larry Fink spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday.Brendan McDermid/ReutersBig-name US investors like BlackRock's Larry Fink and Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman spoke Tuesday in Riyadh.The managers talked up Saudi Arabia's local economy while acknowledging market volatility globally.The panel took place at the Saudi-US Investment Forum, held in conjunction with President Donald Trump's visit.On a panel of billionaires and high-powered CEOs in Riyadh, the competition was not about who has the most assets under management, the best returns, or the swankiest private jet.Instead, the friendly back-and-forth was focused on who had visited Saudi Arabia the most and the date of their first visit to the Middle East country.BlackRock's Larry Fink boasted of coming more than 65 times over several decades.

Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson admitted she was late to the party — her first visit was in 2020 — but said she has made up time by coming on 15 different occasions since.\"It's always a wonderful time to be back in the Kingdom,\" fellow panelist Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citi, said.The event was one of many at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh on Tuesday; the forum is being held in conjuction with President Donald Trump's state visit to the Kingdom, which said at the start of the president's second stint in the White House that it would invest hundreds of billions in the US.American investors, meanwhile, are looking to put capital to work in the Middle East.Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager and is increasingly focused on private market investments in areas like infrastructure, said Saudi Arabia has become a capital \"destination\" instead of just a capital provider for foreign investors.\"The emphasis on 2030 was really a statement to the world that we're going to do it ourselves,\" Fink said about the country's sovereign wealth fund's plan to diversify and grow different parts of the economy.Fraser said the next step for the country's capital markets would be to build a treasury function. Johnson boasted about her firm's new local private credit offering.\"We could see the Kingdom being a top 10 economy in the world,\" Fink said of a country that produced $1.1 trillion in GDP last year — less than half of what Canada, the world's tenth-largest economy, generated in 2024.The optimism for the country's future did not take away from the general uncertainty many finance leaders have expressed about the immediate future, thanks to the Trump administration's tariff policies, though the recent agreement with China has provided hope that the new global trade landscape will be clearer soon.The bigger fear expressed by Fink is not short-term volatility — \"I don't really care about the next 90 days,\" he said — but instead a continued reliance on public funding for long-term projects.The \"vitality\" of any economy, he said, is measured by the amount of private capital flowing to investments that will take years to complete.So far, those who have invested in public-private partnerships in Saudi Arabia are pleased. Schwarzman said his firm's $20 billion in 2018 from the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund has generated annual returns of 17.5%.\"We have a lot of happy friends,\" the billionaire said with a wry smile.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Two new executive orders refocus attention on English language requirements for truck drivers, reviving enforcement protocols that have existed since 1937. Industry voices say training, licensing and real-world risk management are essential priorities beyond language rules. The post Trump’s Executive Order For Trucking Revives a Rule Nearly 90 Years Old appeared first on FreightWaves. In 2025, the national conversation around English proficiency and trucking safety resurfaced with new intensity. Two executive orders, signed by President Donald Trump, renewed emphasis on English language requirements, both at a cultural level and at the level of commercial motor vehicle operations. On March 1, an executive order formally designated English as the official language of the United States. It revoked Executive Order 13166, which had promoted multilingual government services since the Clinton administration. On April 28, a second executive order targeted the commercial trucking sector. It directed the Department of Transportation to reinstate stronger enforcement of existing federal regulations requiring truck drivers to read, speak and communicate effectively in English. The order authorized federal and state roadside inspectors to once again place drivers out of service if they are unable to meet the English proficiency standards. Although the executive actions have generated considerable attention, the core requirement for English proficiency among truck drivers has been law for nearly 90 years. A Regulation with Deep Roots The requirement for English proficiency in commercial motor vehicle operations dates back to July 1937, when the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) were established. Under 49 CFR §391.11(b)(2), drivers must be able to “read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with the general public, understand highway traffic signs and signals, respond to official inquiries, and make entries on reports and records.” For decades, roadside inspectors have cited drivers for violating this rule, with the authority to place noncompliant drivers out of service. By 2014, English proficiency violations were a routine part of commercial enforcement activities across the United States. That year alone, inspectors issued more than 101,000 English proficiency violations. Over 4,000 drivers were placed out of service for failing to meet the standard. 2014 Memo: Regulation Remains, Enforcement Softens In 2014, during the Obama administration, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) partnered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to reclassify the enforcement of the English proficiency rule. While the regulation itself remained intact, inspectors were instructed not to place drivers out of service solely for English language deficiencies. Drivers could still be cited, but they were allowed to continue operating their vehicles. After the memo took effect, English proficiency violations dropped sharply, with enforcement data showing only 7,800 to 10,000 citations issued annually between 2017 and 2024. No drivers were automatically placed out of service during that period for English violations. This shift effectively weakened the practical enforcement of a rule that remained formally required under federal law. 2025 Executive Orders: Reviving Enforcement and National Policy The first of the two 2025 executive orders emphasized English as a cultural and governmental standard, encouraging unity, civic engagement and consistency across federal agencies. The second specifically returned focus to trucking safety and operational communication. It instructed the DOT to update roadside enforcement policies, allowing drivers to once again be placed out of service if they cannot communicate adequately in English. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been tasked with overseeing the update to inspection protocols and ensuring compliance with the revised enforcement approach. The White House framed both orders as efforts to promote road safety, operational efficiency and shared civic values. A Divided Industry Response Supporters of the executive orders argue that the ability to read and understand road signs, respond to safety officials and navigate emergencies in English is fundamental to public safety. Groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have voiced strong support, citing the need for clear communication among drivers, enforcement personnel and the motoring public. Advocates further note that language barriers can contribute to delays during inspections, misunderstandings in critical situations and difficulties in post-crash investigations. Critics, however, caution that while English proficiency is important, it does not address the more urgent safety challenges facing modern trucking. Some argue that the executive orders focus regulatory attention on a requirement that has long existed rather than addressing gaps that continue to impact crash rates and fleet safety outcomes. Among the critical issues cited by safety advocates: Continuous license monitoring is not universally mandated across fleets, leaving gaps in notification of suspended or revoked commercial licenses. Thirteen states, including Arkansas, still allow beginner teen drivers to obtain a driver’s license without completing behind-the-wheel training hours. A few years later, they’re getting a commercial drivers license. Distracted driving remains a growing threat, with federal regulations lagging behind advances in mobile technology. Drug and alcohol testing, while federally required, still faces compliance challenges and inconsistencies in enforcement. Hair follicle testing is a great example. Industry experts also raise concerns about the subjectivity of roadside enforcement. Determining sufficient English proficiency can be highly discretionary, potentially leading to inconsistent or inequitable outcomes across different jurisdictions. Training, Not Language Alone, is the Key Recent high-profile crashes highlight the complexity of highway safety challenges that extend beyond language proficiency. In Colorado, a crash involving commercial driver Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza resulted in multiple fatalities along U.S. Highway 285. Mendoza was alleged to have been operating without a valid commercial driver’s license and had prior offenses on record. In that case, language was not the primary contributing factor. Licensing compliance, training adequacy and operational fitness were the deeper issues. Similar incidents across the country emphasize that failures in training, oversight and risk management, not language alone, remain primary contributors to preventable tragedies on the highway. Moving Toward Substantive Solutions There is no question that the ability to communicate clearly in English is essential for truck drivers operating on American roads. Reading signage, responding to official inquiries and managing emergencies safely depend on basic language proficiency. The emphasis on again enforcing a rule that has existed since 1937 has raised questions about regulatory priorities. While it is essential to reestablish clear enforcement guidelines, many in the industry argue that broader challenges, such as improved driver training, real-time compliance monitoring and enhanced sobriety initiatives, deserve equal, if not greater, attention. The commercial vehicle safety landscape requires solutions grounded in comprehensive preparation, risk control and operational excellence, regardless of language. Truck drivers move America’s economy. The policies that govern them must be as practical, forward-thinking and evidence-based as the industry itself.

Wells Fargo said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated a consent order related to the company’s compliance risk management program. The order was issued in 2018 and is the 12th consent order closed by regulators since 2019 and the sixth since the start of the year, according to a Monday (April 28) press release. “Today’s termination, along with the recent closure of other consent orders, demonstrates that we have completed much of our common risk and control infrastructure work, including work that is required by other orders,” Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in the release. “I am proud of the work done by our teams and remain confident that we will complete the work needed to close our other open consent orders.” Wells Fargo has been struggling with regulatory issues for the better part of a decade following the “fake accounts” scandal at the bank in 2016. The Federal Reserve also placed an asset cap on the lender in 2018, limiting its balance sheet to $1.95 trillion. The CFPB did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Wells Fargo’s efforts to regain compliance have fostered hopes that the asset cap could soon be lifted, Reuters reported Monday. Wells Fargo announced in January the termination of a 2022 CFPB consent order related to automobile and mortgage lending and consumer deposit accounts. That order included a $3.7 billion fine and required Wells Fargo to halt the practice of surprise overdraft fees or fees for deposit accounts “when the consumer had available funds at the time of a purchase or other debit transaction, but then subsequently had a negative balance once the transaction settled,” the CFPB said in December 2022. The order settled a case in which the CFPB accused the bank of a series of illegal acts, such as illegally assessed fees and interest charges on loans, wrongful car repossessions and unlawful overdraft fees. The CFPB is scaling back its enforcement of financial institutions. The agency said it wants to focus more on crimes against consumers — particularly military families — and less on things like digital payments, medical debt and student loans.

        "description": "Officials in Panama say Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings’ contract to run two ports at the Panama Canal has cost the nation $1.3 billion. U.S. investment firm BlackRock is spearheading a possible purchase of the ports’ operations. The post Panama to file charges over alleged sweetheart port contract appeared first on FreightWaves. The comptroller of Panama said on Monday that the country will file criminal complaints against officials at CK Hutchison Holdings, the Hong Kong conglomerate that runs ports on each end of the Panama Canal, as well as Panamanian government officials, after determining that CK Hutchison’s contract heavily disadvantages Panama, the Financial Times reported. The announcement comes as CK Hutchison considers a $23 billion sale of operations at the two ports to a consortium including U.S.-based investment firm BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) and Geneva-based ocean carrier Mediterranean Shipping Co. A subsidiary of CK Hutchison in 1997 renegotiated a contract that has since cost the country $1.3 billion in revenue, Panama’s comptroller general, Anel Bolo Flores, claimed. Flores said the Panamanian people and prosecutors deserve an explanation for “such benevolence in a contract that has been abusive to say the least,” the Financial Times reported. Further complicating the potential BlackRock sale is an ongoing review of the purchase by officials in China. The sale would include terminal operations at the Balboa and Cristobal ports and was announced soon after statements by President Donald Trump that the U.S. should retake control of the canal for reasons of national security. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is in Panama and was slated to meet President José Raúl Mulino on Tuesday. Panamanian officials have dismissed Trump’s concerns that China has too much control of the canal. Larry Fink, chair of BlackRock, said at a meeting of the Economic Club of New York on Monday that the sale will likely move forward over China’s objections, the Financial Times reported. Fink said the port operations in Panama are only a small fraction of the value of a deal designed to ensure U.S. access to 43 ports in nearly two dozen countries, according to investor-oriented news outlet Benzinga. Benzinga reported that CK Hutchison is alleged to owe hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of unpaid fees and that the contract with the Panama Maritime Authority was extended without proper clearances.

Late last year, PYMNTS Intelligence reported that 28% of payments executives were seeing an increase in fraud and risk management uncertainties, and a commensurate percentage saw losses exceeding half a million dollars in the preceding 12 months. It’s no surprise to Eric Stratman, senior director of analytics and insights at ValidiFI, who told PYMNTS in an interview that many firms grapple with outdated risk assessment processes. Because of those legacy systems, they transact online and across ACH networks playing a futile game of catch-up with scammers. “Fraudsters are constantly evolving” as they shift to different attack vectors depending on the “use case” of the customer and the payment being made, Stratman told PYMNTS. When businesses “use standard validation methods to verify payments, they’re lagging,” he said. There’s no longer any way for a bank to simply look at variables or data points to make sure that bank accounts are valid — among the first lines of defense against criminals. Several Data Points Triangulating a range of data points to validate those accounts and detect fraud before it makes an impact can save those firms massive hits to their bottom lines and reputations. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key technological ingredients in collecting and analyzing a slew of data, spanning payment performance, identity elements and bank account level data to find the fraudulent patterns and the “needle in a haystack” that ValidiFI (through its banks solution) can point out to client firms to prevent adverse events, he said. Predictive bank account intelligence, then, becomes a multilayered line of defense, thwarting the criminals before they strike with malevolent intent — and identity-related fraud is a clear favorite of the criminals as those stolen identities pave a path to new account fraud, takeover fraud and fraudulent loan applications. “Pairing typical account validation with fraud checks provides us with a clearer picture and more confidence because we’re not only able to tell you that the account trying to process a transaction is valid — we can tell you if that consumer matches with that bank account, and how often they’re appearing and changing in our database as well,” Stratman said of his firm’s intelligence algorithms. That same data, provided to banking clients, can help improve their operational efficiencies. In a nod to those efficiencies, Stratman gave the example where a banking client came to ValidiFI with the pressing concern of a high rate of fraudulent transactions. The company’s data and analytics uncovered that a single individual was transacting across 10 different bank accounts in a bid to cover their tracks. The client was able to eliminate 25% of invalid payments and 13% of fraudulent transactions, while only cutting 4% of successful transactions. Cross-referencing has its benefits when seeking to ferret out fraud. In its own reporting, ValidiFI estimated that fraud risk increases nearly 60% when more than three Social Security numbers are tied to a single account used within a 90-day period. In addition, consumers with more than three emails linked to the same Social Security number in the last 30 days are representative of a two times higher fraud risk. Fraudsters are more than twice as likely to have mismatched phone numbers and ZIP codes when they seek to transact from an account. “We’re minimizing the impact on [legitimate] transactions while increasing the amount of fraudulent payments and accounts that we’re flagging,” he said. The solution is customizable to the banking client’s risk tolerance, Stratman said. “We’re creating the full picture of bank account and payments intelligence — because the fundamental piece within the puzzle is that we need to make sure that the account trying to process that transaction is valid,” he told PYMNTS.

The new Zip for Risk Orchestration enables global organizations to streamline supplier risk assessments, financial verification and regulatory compliance to mitigate risks related to fraud, security breaches and enforcement actions, the company said in a Tuesday (April 1) press release. “Just […] The post Zip Launches Supplier Risk Management Solution for Global Organizations appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Zip has added a solution for supplier risk management to its procurement orchestration platform. The new Zip for Risk Orchestration enables global organizations to streamline supplier risk assessments, financial verification and regulatory compliance to mitigate risks related to fraud, security breaches and enforcement actions, the company said in a Tuesday (April 1) press release. “Just as we transformed procurement orchestration, we’re now helping businesses proactively manage regulatory and operational risks worldwide,” Zip Co-founder and CEO Rujul Zaparde said in the release. Zip for Risk Orchestration features vendor due diligence with automated bank account verification and tax ID validation; a centralized risk depository that includes compliance data, contracts and risk scores; and automated approval workflows to unify risk management across procurement, finance, legal and IT, according to the release. The solution also provides risk scoring and tiering that prioritizes oversight based on industry, location and regulatory exposure; scheduled risk reviews that ensure compliance with evolving regulations; and vendor auditing and reporting for meeting regulatory requirements, per the release. Zip for Risk Orchestration is designed to help businesses meet the challenge of managing supplier relationships at a time when regulations worldwide are changing, the release said. “The challenge has never been more urgent; companies now have more suppliers than employees, and 98% of global organizations have a relationship with at least one third party that has been breached — creating a perfect storm of financial, security and compliance threats,” the release said. Supplier risk and know your business (KYB) are becoming increasingly critical issues, as businesses must know who they’re buying from, who their suppliers are buying from and whether anyone along that supply chain is a regulatory nightmare waiting to happen, PYMNTS reported in February. Newly imposed tariffs are also causing seismic shifts in global trade that require chief financial officers to take a proactive, strategic approach to risk management. When announcing in October that it secured $190 million in Series D funding, Zip said procurement is under the microscope because companies face increasing pressure to optimize spending and manage risk. “Zip has already proven that we can fix that, saving our customers billions of dollars and thousands of hours of time — and our new round of funding will allow us to continue to revolutionize business spending,” Zaparde said at the time in a press release.

        "description": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink reassures investors that this moment of economic anxiety will pass, in his annual letter out Monday morning.Why it matters: Fink runs the world's biggest asset manager and is hugely influential — his widely read letter typically reflects the business trends of the current moment. This year it comes at a time of high market uncertainty, as tariff disruptions rock the business world.Where it stands: Fink treads cautiously in the 27-page letter, never explicitly mentioning President Trump, and only touches on glancingly on politics at the very top.\"I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory. I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out,\" he says in a draft of the letter viewed by Axios. The intrigue: Fink's letter comes at a politically fraught moment for BlackRock.The firm's deal to buy two Panama Canal ports from Hong Kong's CK Hutchison has become a political football between the governments of the U.S., Panama and China. What looked like an off-ramp for U.S. complaints that China had too much influence at the canal now threatens to become a bargaining chip in a larger geopolitical reordering. Between the lines: In past years, Fink has used the letter to espouse views on topics that are now toxic flashpoints for the Trump administration — like climate change, flexibility for workers or corporate social responsibility.This year, as fierce backlash has grown, the firm joined many others in walking back its DEI policies.Zoom in: Instead of politics, Fink focuses on private markets, a more opaque area of investment that's ballooned in popularity in recent years — and where BlackRock has made a series of deals over the past year, trying to become a dominant player. Some letter highlights:With deficits ballooning, governments are going to need private-market money to build bridges, power plants and other critical public buildings and utilities, he writes. \"The markets are eager to step in where governments and corporations are stepping out.\"Instead of a traditional 60/40 split between stocks and bonds, Fink wants investors to diversify into these private market assets, a mix he calls 50/30/20 (stocks, bonds, private assets like infrastructure and real estate). \"Economic democracy\": Fink says capitalism has worked for \"too few people,\" and wants to give more investors access to those private markets. Not coincidentally, bringing more investors into the markets is good for the firm's bottom line.Fink endorses the idea of baby bonds, proposed by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.). \"Imagine a child born today whose personal wealth grows in step with America's.

Ben Geman contributed. Go Deeper: Read Larry Fink's letter to investors BlackRock CEO Larry Fink reassures investors that this moment of economic anxiety will pass, in his annual letter out Monday morning.Why it matters: Fink runs the world's biggest asset manager and is hugely influential — his widely read letter typically reflects the business trends of the current moment. This year it comes at a time of high market uncertainty, as tariff disruptions rock the business world.Where it stands: Fink treads cautiously in the 27-page letter, never explicitly mentioning President Trump, and only touches on glancingly on politics at the very top.\"I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory. I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out,\" he says in a draft of the letter viewed by Axios. The intrigue: Fink's letter comes at a politically fraught moment for BlackRock.The firm's deal to buy two Panama Canal ports from Hong Kong's CK Hutchison has become a political football between the governments of the U.S., Panama and China. What looked like an off-ramp for U.S. complaints that China had too much influence at the canal now threatens to become a bargaining chip in a larger geopolitical reordering. Between the lines: In past years, Fink has used the letter to espouse views on topics that are now toxic flashpoints for the Trump administration — like climate change, flexibility for workers or corporate social responsibility.This year, as fierce backlash has grown, the firm joined many others in walking back its DEI policies.Zoom in: Instead of politics, Fink focuses on private markets, a more opaque area of investment that's ballooned in popularity in recent years — and where BlackRock has made a series of deals over the past year, trying to become a dominant player. Some letter highlights:With deficits ballooning, governments are going to need private-market money to build bridges, power plants and other critical public buildings and utilities, he writes. \"The markets are eager to step in where governments and corporations are stepping out.\"Instead of a traditional 60/40 split between stocks and bonds, Fink wants investors to diversify into these private market assets, a mix he calls 50/30/20 (stocks, bonds, private assets like infrastructure and real estate). \"Economic democracy\": Fink says capitalism has worked for \"too few people,\" and wants to give more investors access to those private markets. Not coincidentally, bringing more investors into the markets is good for the firm's bottom line.Fink endorses the idea of baby bonds, proposed by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.). \"Imagine a child born today whose personal wealth grows in step with America's. That's what an economic democracy could look like: a country where everybody has a new avenue— investing—to pursue happiness and financial freedom.\"Dollar dominance under threat: \"The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world's reserve currency for decades. But that's not guaranteed to last forever,\" Fink warns.\"If the U.S. doesn't get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.\"BlackRock was the first to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF in 2024 — a move that helped legitimize cryptocurrency in the traditional investing world.Energy pragmatism: The world faces growing demand for energy that can't be filled with renewables alone, he said.

There is a growing concern for middle-market firms in the United States, and it surrounds fraud and risk management. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Fraud Risk Management Pushes Innovation Delays as Uncertainty Rises” highlighted how increasing fraud-related uncertainty is forcing companies to divert resources and postpone growth initiatives. Heads of payments at middle-market firms, those with annual revenues ranging from $100 million to $1 billion, reported that the need to manage escalating fraud risks is disrupting their businesses. This shift in focus underscores the operational influence that fraud concerns now exert, extending beyond direct fraud prevention measures. The report, based on a survey conducted from Sept. 5 to Sept. 17, 2024, with 60 heads of payment, indicated a divergence between general business uncertainty and specific anxieties about fraud. While 22% of respondents reported high overall uncertainty in September, a decrease from 30% in March, the percentage citing uncertainty in fraud and risk management impacting their operations surged to 28% in September, up from 17% in March. This heightened concern is not merely abstract; many of these companies are experiencing tangible consequences and are compelled to delay or cancel innovation projects and reallocate resources to combat the growing threat of fraud. This dynamic suggests that despite positive macroeconomic trends, the specter of fraud is becoming a dominant factor in shaping strategic decisions within the middle market. Here are three key data points from the report. Overall Uncertainty Decline: Only 22% of heads of payment reported high uncertainty in September, a decrease from 30% in March, but before the tariff- and trade-related uncertainty of the first quarter of 2025. Rising Fraud Uncertainty: The report found that 28% of heads of payment indicated that fraud and risk management uncertainties impacted their operations in September, an increase from 17% in March. Innovation Delays: Approximately 66% of heads of payment in high-uncertainty environments reported frequently delaying or canceling innovation and technology initiatives due to fraud risks. Beyond these core findings, the report also revealed a softening optimism regarding future uncertainty. While 57% of heads of payments anticipated an improvement in their operational uncertainty over the next year in September, the figure represented a decline from 67% in June. Those already experiencing high levels of uncertainty were less hopeful, with 15% expecting improvement in contrast to the 56% who felt this way in March. This lack of confidence among firms facing high uncertainty could lead to more cautious decision making, further hindering innovation and long-term planning. In response to these escalating fraud concerns, over half of the surveyed middle-market firms said they increased their reliance on technology in the prior 30 days, with artificial intelligence investments seeing a rise from 6.7% in June to 22% in September. A growing number of companies are incorporating new processes and workflows to bolster their long-term resilience against fraud. These strategic adjustments underscore the impact that fraud-related uncertainty is having on the operational priorities of middle-market firms.

        "description": "Corporate reforms in Japan and China's AI boom are reasons to be bullish on stocks in those markets, BlackRock says. Tyler Le/BIUS exceptionalism has stumbled in 2025 as markets struggle against trade war and economic uncertainty. BlackRock recommends investors look to Japan and China for alternatives. The firm remains overweight on the US, though tariffs and rising yields are a threat.As the market's US exceptionalism narrative wanes this year, there are two places investors may want to look to for returns.Amid trade uncertainty and dimming economic prospects, US markets have been rattled in 2025. The recent stock market correction has spurred talk that investors may be better off looking abroad than hoping for US equities to regain their footing. After years of underperformance, international stocks are suddenly in the spotlight as they surpass US peers.According to BlackRock, there are two markets in particular where investors should look to park some money. JapanThe world's largest asset manager thinks the earnings outlook has improved for Japanese companies. Corporate reforms and mild inflation will help, and have resulted in companies' returns on equity hitting a peak. Corporate profitability for Japanese firms recently reached a four-decade high, BlackRock said. Last week, Japan's Topix exchange rose 3.3%, shooting past the S&P 500's 0.5% weekly gain.However, the possibility of a stronger yen could diminish the earnings outlook, BlackRock added. While the currency's appreciation has slowed, traders will have to watch the economic data in the country and the actions of its central bank.ChinaBlackRock is also modestly overweight on the world's second-largest economy, encouraged by recent artificial intelligence and tech developments. A flurry of competitive AI projects out of China has ratcheted up the competition to US tech dominance, pushing the tech-heavy Hang Seng index up 20% year-to-date.\"That contrasts with the onshore benchmark CSI 300, roughly flat this year, showing how the AI theme in China has been centered in tech as it initially was in the US,\" the note said.Yet, this also means that the country remains susceptible to tariff risks and structural macro challenges, and BlackRock remains \"ready to pivot\" on its outlook. Analysts have told Business Insider that the nation's government is looking to correct course after a period of stringent regulation of the country's tech sector scared investors away in 2024. To be sure, US stocks are getting a respite from the downturn, and commentators say American exceptionalism could soon see a revival. Morgan Stanley wrote on Monday that a resurgence of US equities led by fresh gains for the Magnificent Seven could be a catalyst to restart the broader rally. Reports that the next wave of tariffs would be softer than expected sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher in Monday's session. For its part, BlackRock still holds an overweight on the US market, betting on upside from the AI theme and broadening earnings growth. Yet a surge in long-term bond yields or further escalations in a global trade war are looming risks.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "With stocks down to start 2025, the strong returns you can find in the fixed-income market may look attractive right about now. A trader at the CBOE.Scott Olson/Getty ImagesStocks are down in 2025, perhaps making fixed-income market returns appealing.BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities fund yields 6.4%.The fund has an average duration of three years.With stocks down to start 2025, the consistent and relatively strong returns you can find in the fixed-income market may look attractive right about now. Cash equivalents like 3-month Treasury bills still offer yields above 4% as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates elevated.But the best place to be sitting at the moment is a bit further up in duration, according to Russ Brownback, the global head of macro positioning for fixed income and a co-portfolio manager of the $41 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX).Brownback's fund currently yields 6.4% if held to maturity and is overweight short-to-medium-term securities. With a flat yield curve, this approach locks in income a bit longer than cash equivalents but saves investors from the volatility that the potential for rising inflation or a recession could bring to longer-duration assets, he said.\"The Agg has about 6.5 years duration, we have about three,\" Brownback told BI, referencing the Barclays Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index. \"We hold about 70% of our duration five years and shorter.\"But it's not just a matter of duration. To generate the 6.4% yield, Brownback tries to mix up the perfect cocktail of riskier assets with safer ones.Around 28% of the fund is in commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and non-agency mortgages, he said. By diversifying these riskier assets with higher-quality AAA securitized products, as well as with both higher- and lower-quality corporate credit, you get a robust return, Brownback said. AAA-rated credit is the highest class of investment-grade bonds, meaning the assets have the lowest risk levels.\"That is the real sweet spot,\" Brownback said of the mix. \"As long as we're owning that in a diversified way, that's about the highest Sharpe Ratio that exists in markets today,\" he added, referencing the risk-to-reward ratio.Despite the emphasis on diversification, Brownback said he's not worried about an impending economic downturn — a fear that has roiled markets lately as President Donald Trump implements sweeping tariff policies.\"There's a lot of hyperbole around 'Oh my gosh, we're going to have a recession,' but that's been the narrative for the last two years, whether it was the regional banking crisis in '23 or last year thinking the central banks were staying too tight,\" he said. \"It feels like conventional wisdom has been looking for a hard landing around every corner for three years. We just don't see that.\"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kept interest rates steady on at the central bank's March meeting, a signal that the economy may be stable enough not to need precautionary policy measures. But the decision to pause rate cuts was also a nod to the potential for inflation to flare up again amid tariffs, a reason Brownback is largely staying away from the long-end of the yield curve.\"The Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" Powell said at a March 19 press conference. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

But AI […] The post A Matter of Trust: How AI Is Reshaping Risk Assessment appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Financial services institutions have long relied on machine learning for risk management, but the threat landscape has grown exponentially in the age of generative artificial intelligence (AI), according to executives from Capital One, Visa and Alloy. Fraudsters now have access to AI tools, including synthetic identity generation and real-time phishing attacks, they said. But AI is also arming companies to supercharge their defensive capabilities, since trust and security are the foundation of financial transactions. “Trust is the very foundation of commerce,” said Rajat Taneja, president of technology at Visa. “When two unknown parties are transacting, they have to trust that the transaction will occur correctly, the money will be transferred properly, any dispute will be managed, and there’s someone handling fraud and scams.” Taneja said the first use case for AI in financial services was actually in risk management, and it remains a “critical tool to combat fraud, scams and enumeration attacks.” (Enumeration attacks are those that test different credentials such as passwords and usernames to gain unauthorized access.) The challenge is that criminals now also can use AI to attack. “We have ChatGPT, they have ‘FraudGPT,’” Taneja said. “It’s a constant battle.” FraudGPT is like the evil twin of ChatGPT: It is a malicious generative AI tool designed specifically for cybercriminal activities like creating phishing emails, undetectable malware and developing hacking tools. Subscription fees start at $200 per month and goes up to $1,700 per year. Visa, which processes more than $16 trillion annually, has used AI for fraud detection since 1992, according to Taneja. The latest advancements in GenAI let Visa develop models that detect fraud faster and more effectively. Shape-Shifting Adversary Prem Natarajan, chief scientist and head of enterprise AI at Capital One, likened AI-powered fraud to organisms with fast development cycles. Unlike traditional fraud techniques, modern AI-driven scams can adapt in real time. This ability to shift allows cybercriminals to continuously tweak their approaches based on what works. “It’s the first time we have a shape-shifter, in that, as it’s interacting with you, it can adapt itself,” he said during a panel discussion at the HumanX conference last week. Laura Spiekerman, co-founder of identity risk management company Alloy, emphasized that while deep fakes and identity fraud dominate headlines, a more worrisome trend is the speed at which AI allows fraudsters to operate. “We’ve seen synthetic fraud for six, seven, eight years now,” she said, explaining that this is when criminals build credible identities over time using half real credentials and half fake — and then cash out in large sums fraudulently. “What we’re seeing AI do is actually speed that up,” Spiekerman said. A key question in the discussion was when AI will be trusted enough to operate without human oversight. Natarajan said humans will always be involved, not just as reviewers but as end customers. “So the real question is how can we get signals from the end customer that we’re building trust with them with the AI we’re serving them?” Natarajan cited Capital One’s Chat Concierge, a multiagent conversational AI system designed for both car buyers and dealers. It not only provides information but also takes action on customer requests. Chat Concierge has been trained on Capital One data. “There is a human in the loop to make sure it doesn’t go awry,” Natarajan said. “We always use that as a guardrail.” Another use case is in call centers. Capital One is using AI to help its customer service representatives. “The moment when the agent picks up the call and starts talking with you is actually a high moment of impatience for the customer and a high-stress moment for the agent,” Natarajan said. With AI, Capital One can “simplify the agent’s experience in that moment and make it that much less stressful, transfer the burden from them to the system,” Natarajan added. AI and Compliance Taneja said Visa, which operates in 200 countries and processes 300 billion transactions annually, is investing in AI-driven compliance frameworks. “Compliance is a huge foundation for us,” Taneja said. “Compliance, both in the letter and spirit [of the law], is fundamental to the DNA of a platform like ours. And you have to do it in the spirit of making sure that your data complies with privacy, security [regulations] and ensuring every rule of every country you operate in is fully adhered to.” Spiekerman noted that financial institutions across the board, whether big or small, tend to react to fraud by shutting down operations rather than adapting their AI-driven fraud detection models. “When these financial institutions get hit with fraud, their answer is ‘shut it down,’” Spiekerman said. Instead, they should use AI to modify their response and selectively let some customers through. Looking ahead, Natarajan said AI will move from enabling “interactions to actions.” The future of AI in finance is one in which it can predict what actions to take, do those actions and complete them, he explained. At Visa, Taneja was excited about the idea of “agentic commerce,” where an AI agent does some aspects of the shopping process such as doing research, price matching, checking out warranties and finding goods the human user might like to buy. “The agentic commerce piece is very exciting,” Taneja said. “You get goosebumps thinking about what is coming next.” The post A Matter of Trust: How AI Is Reshaping Risk Assessment appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

        "description": "The agreement will give a BlackRock consortium a majority stake in two terminal ports. Trump has said he wants the trade route under US control. Monrovia NSU CHALLENGER bulk carrier transits the expanded canal through Cocoli Locks at the Panama Canal, on the outskirts of Panama City, Panama April 19, 2023.Reuters/ARIS MARTINEZBlackRock stock edged higher a day after it announced a deal to help acquire two ports in Panama.President Trump has touted the deal as he seeks to more US control of the crucial waterway. It marks the largest infrastructure deal in BlackRock's history.The move: BlackRock rose 1% at the start of trading on Wednesday, reaching $961 per share. The stock has struggled this year, and is still down about 7% year-to-date. Why: The world's largest asset manager is leading a consortium to buy a majority stake in the two ports from CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate. The deal is valued at $22.8 billion.In his address to Congress on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump acknowledged the deal, which involves BlackRock's acquisition of two Panama Canal ports.\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,\" Trump said during his address. CK Hutchison expects to receive over $19 billion in cash proceeds for the sale — worth as much as its valuation, according to Bloomberg. Its stock rose as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday.The consortium, made up of BlackRock's Global Infrastructures Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, will acquire 90% of the Panama Ports company. The firm operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals.What it means: The deal hands a political win to Trump, who has said Chinese interests have taken control of the pivotal trade route. The White House has gone as far as suggesting that the canal be returned return to US hands.\"The Panama Canal was built by Americans, for Americans, not for others, but others could use it,\" Trump said. If the ports change hands, this might relieve US pressure on Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino. However, he pushed back on Trump's Tuesday notion that Washington was \"reclaiming\" the canal.For BlackRock, it marks the largest infrastructure deal in its history. The ports have made up a large part of CK Hutchinson's port division, which was the firm's third-biggest business in the first half of last year, Bloomberg reports.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "A consortium led by U.S. private equity firm BlackRock has agreed to purchase the Panama port terminals owned by CK Hutchison of Hong Kong. The post After Trump pressure, China sells Panama port terminals to US private equity firm, MSC appeared first on FreightWaves. In a blockbuster deal that could shift the balance of power in global port operations, a consortium of U.S. private equity firm BlackRock and MSC of Geneva has agreed to purchase the non-Chinese assets of Hong Kong-based subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, including terminals at the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama. The news follows disputed claims by President Donald Trump that the Chinese military was controlling the Panama Canal, and that American vessels were being cheated on transit tolls. Trump also threatened U.S. action to wrest control of the waterway, a key route for military and merchant vessels between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which was handed over to Panama in 1999. In a release, Hutchison (0001.HK) denied that the sale was a result of political pressure. The U.S. on Tuesday doubled to 20% tariffs on Chinese goods in an effort to force Beijing to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. The deal announced Tuesday will see the consortium BlackRock-TiL acquire 90% of Hutchison’s stake in the Panama facilities as well as the China company’s 80% controlling interest in 199 berths at 43 ports in 23 countries. BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit partnered on the $22.8 billion deal with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), backed by MSC, the world’s largest ocean container line. It does not include HPH port properties in Hong Kong or China. It was not immediately clear how the sale to MSC would affect operations of competing liner operators at former Hutchison ports. The sale is subject to approval by the government of Panama. Find more articles by Stuart Chirls here.
