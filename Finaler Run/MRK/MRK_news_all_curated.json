        "description": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics shares surged 31% after the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources, that the company had rejected an initial acquisition offer by Merck & Co. for more than $3 billion. The post StockWatch: Report of $3B+ Merck Buyout Offer Propels MoonLake Stock Surge appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. Speaking on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Merck & Co. [NYSE: MRK] chairman and CEO Robert M. Davis sought to reassure analysts that the company was very much interested in growing through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) despite an uncertain economic climate that has dampened dealmaking among biopharmas. “I am confident that you are going to see us get some stuff done as we move forward because we’ve got things in the queue that we’re looking for,” Davis said, according to Merck’s transcript of the call. One of those things appears to be Swiss-based MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: MLTX). This past week, MoonLake shares surged 31% after the Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that the company had rejected an initial acquisition offer by Merck for more than $3 billion. Both companies declined to comment. “The price tag would have to be much higher than the ~$3.2B mkt cap [market capitalization] that MoonLake is currently trading at,” opined Edward Nash, Canaccord Genuity’s biotechnology senior analyst specializing in metabolic disease and immunology and inflammation (I&I), in a June 3 research note. Nash based his thinking on how MoonLake’s market cap—the product of the share price and the number of outstanding shares—has grown from $2.6 billion since Merck’s offer was announced. MoonLake shares climbed 5.5% from $39.01 to $41.16 on June 2, the day news of Merck’s interest in MoonLake surfaced, then jumped another 24% over two days to $51.05 Wednesday before fading 4% to $48.83 Thursday and dropping another 4% Friday to $46.88. Merck shares dipped 0.8% on June 2 from $76.84 to $76.25, then rose nearly 3% over two days to $78.27 on Wednesday before dipping another 0.8% to $77.67 on Thursday, followed by a 1.6% increase Friday to $78.93. MoonLake’s pipeline consists of nine programs focused on developing a single drug— sonelokimab, a humanized Nanobody® designed to selectively bind with high affinity to IL-17A and IL-17F, thereby inhibiting the IL-17A/A, IL-17A/F, and IL-17F/F dimers that drive inflammation. Sonelomimab, previously known as M1095 or ALX-0761, is just ~40 kDa small and consists of three VHH domains covalently linked by flexible glycine-serine spacers. Sonelokimab is under study in five Phase III trials—two in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), one in adolescent HS, and two in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Sonelokimab is also Phase III ready for psoriasis and is in Phase II trials for three additional I&I indications: Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and a combination indication of PsA + axSpa. September inflection point Brian Abrahams, MD, a managing director and co-head of biotechnology research with RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note that if Merck or another company were to acquire MoonLake, it would not likely occur until at least September, when MoonLake expects to report primary endpoint data for its three Phase III HS trials: VELA-1 (NCT06411899), VELA-2 (NCT06411379), and VELA-TEEN (NCT06768671). VELA-1 and -2 are parallel identical trials designed to compare a single 120 mg dose of sonelokimab to placebo with the primary endpoint being a 16-week readout of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) 75, a ≥75% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count, with no increase in abscess or draining tunnel count relative to baseline. From week 16, all patients will receive the 120 mg dose of sonelokimab through to 52 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for up to two years. VELA-TEEN is an open-label, single-arm trial with the primary endpoint to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the 120 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of sonelokimab over 24 weeks in 30 to 40 adolescents ages 12–17, with moderate-to-severe HS, from U.S. sites with experience in pediatric dermatology. “We continue to believe SLK [sonelokimab]’s data will be robust enough (22–24% [placebo]-adjusted HiSCR75) to reaffirm potential competitive advantages and a key role in the multi-$B market—driving substantial share appreciation and crystallizing a compelling profile for both investors and potential acquirers,” Abrahams wrote. Those advantages, he elaborated, include potential best in class efficacy based on MoonLake’s data from the Phase II MIRA trial (NCT05322473), which showed 29% placeb-adjusted efficacy on HiSCR75 at the go-forward 120 mg dose level, and 38% at the standard of HiSCR50 (≥50% reduction), outperforming historical results from two currently marketed blockbuster drugs, AbbVie’s Humira® (adalimumab) and Novartis’ Cosentyx® (secukinumab). Similar affinity Among IL-17A/F inhibitors, Abrahams wrote, sonelokimab could differentiate itself from UCB’s marketed drug Bimzelx® (bimekizumab), whose label was expanded to HS last year, standing out based on a similar affinity for IL-17A and F, a smaller molecular size enabling it to penetrate deep avascular HS lesions, and a targeting of distinct epitopes on IL-17A and F, rather than the largely overlapping epitope targeted by Bimzelx. “We believe SLK is highly likely to demonstrate a 22–24% [placebo]-adjusted HiSCR75 delta. We believe this result would differentiate SLK vs. Bimzelx and could see [MoonLake’s] stock move 70%+ to the upside,” Abrahams said. That would translate, he said, into a share price of more than $110 a share, with 30% to 40% of that price added on because of interest from potential buyers like Merck. MoonLake launched in May 2021 by acquiring sonelokimab in 2021, licensing the drug from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for $29.9 million, with MoonLake issuing equity to German Merck, representing a 9.9% ownership stake in a MoonLake subsidiary. Three months later, founder Jorge Santos da Silva, a former senior partner with McKinsey & Co., was named CEO. According to its Form 10-K annual report for 2024 filed February 26, MoonLake agreed to pay German Merck milestone cash payments of up to €307.1 million (about $350 million), of which €7.5 million ($8 million) had been recognized as R&D expense as of the end of 2024. MoonLake also agreed to pay additional future payments tied to achieving regulatory filing acceptances in the United States, the European Union, and Japan; the first commercial sales in all three regions; and meeting specified annual thresholds in global net sales. The deal also requires MoonLake to pay royalties in the low to mid-teen percent of net sales to German Merck. As for Merck, the potential buyer, one factor believed to be fueling its interest in MoonLake is its estimate that the total market for HS biologic treatments will grow from $2 billion-plus to between $10 billion and $15 billion by 2035. While MoonLake has not estimated how much of that total it expects to generate from sonelokimab, TD Cowen has offered its own peak-sales forecast for sonelokimab, with analyst Phil Nadeau projecting $4 billion-plus in peak sales. Losing exclusivity Such a forecast would likely prove appealing to Merck at a time when its two biggest blockbuster franchises face loss of patent exclusivity in coming years: Gardasil/Gardasil 9 (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) will all see their U.S. patents start to expire in 2028, though Keytruda is protected by two additional patents in the compound family that have an additional year of exclusivity—patents that Merck cautioned in its Form 10-K annual filing for 2024 that it “expects that they will be the subject of litigation in the future.” Keytruda was last year’s top-selling drug with sales of $29.482 billion, while Gardasil/Gardasil 9 racked up $8.583 billion. Investors are looking for Merck to recoup the lost revenues through more and bigger acquisitions. Since last year, Merck has acquired three companies in relatively small “bolt-on” deals: EyeBio (for $1.3 billion upfront and potentially up to $3 billion overall), Abceutics (for up to $208 million), and Harpoon Therapeutics (for about $680 million). One factor slowing down potential additional buyouts, Merck CEO Davis told analysts on the Q1 earnings call, is coming to terms with sellers on the value of companies to be acquired. “We continue to see, at least in the conversations we’ve had, a little bit of a disconnect between what is the reality of the market that the sellers face and what is the expectation for value that they have. I don’t think they are fully yet aligned to the realities of where we are today.” Despite that tug-of-war, Davis added, “it’s not stopping us from being aggressive and wanting to move forward and do deals.” “I think you’ll see us continue to do a range of opportunities which cover the full spectrum. Because as we look at it, it’s about how do we position ourselves for growth. And in some cases, in some of these therapeutic areas, we think there’s still unmet need.” Leaders and laggards Liminatus Pharma (NASDAQ: LIMN) shares more than quadrupled, zooming 364% over two days after the company said Wednesday it regained compliance with Nasdaq’s rule requiring timely filing of reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, based on a letter received Tuesday from the exchange stating that the matter was now closed. Shares more than doubled, leaping 140% Wednesday from $5.30 to $12.71, then nearly doubled again, soaring another 94% to $24.60. Lyra Therapeutics (NASDAQ: LYRA) shares more than quadrupled, catapulting 311% from $4.93 to $20.25 on June 2 after the company reported positive r",

        "description": "The collaboration positions Merck to challenge two other pharma giants that aim to treat cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting Lp(a), a form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that plays a key role in the transport of cholesterol in the bloodstream. The post Merck, Hengrui Launch Up-to-$2B+ Cardiometabolic Collaboration appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. Merck & Co. has agreed to license the oral small molecule Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] inhibitor HRS-5346 from Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, through a licensing agreement that could generate up to $2 billion plus for the Chinese drug developer. Hengrui Pharma has granted Merck exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize HRS-5346 worldwide, except in Greater China where Hengrui will retain rights. At China’s Peking University Third Hospital, HRS-5346 is under study in a Phase II trial (NCT06816264) designed to assess the drug’s efficacy and safety in adults with elevated Lp(a) at high risk for cardiovascular events. Dean Y. Li, MD, PhD, president, Merck Research Laboratories, hailed HRS-5346 in a statement as “an important addition that expands and complements our cardiometabolic pipeline.” “Elevated blood concentrations of Lp(a) provide a well-documented risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, affecting as many as 1 in 5 adults globally,” Li stated. Merck agreed to pay Hengrui $200 million upfront and up to $1.77 billion in payments tied to achieving development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, plus royalties on net sales of HRS-5346, if approved. The collaboration agreement positions Merck to challenge two other pharma giants that aim to treat cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting Lp(a), a form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that plays a key role in the transport of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Last November, Eli Lilly announced positive Phase II data showing three dosages of its oral, once daily muvalaplin (10 mg, 60 mg, and 240 mg) to have met the primary endpoint of a Phase II trial (NCT05565742) by showing significant reductions in Lp(a) levels vs placebo. Reductions were 47.6% (10 mg), 81.7% (60 mg), and 85.8% (240 mg) with an intact Lp(a) assay, and 40.4% (10 mg), 70.0% (60 mg), and 68.9% (240 mg) with an apolipoprotein A [apo(a)] assay. $2B+ dyslipidemia partnership And last October, AstraZeneca inked a potentially $2 billion-plus collaboration deal of its own to advance the development of YS2302018, a small molecule Lp(a) inhibitor designed to treat dyslipidemia. The pharma giant exclusively licensed rights to the preclinical candidate from Chinese-based CSPC Pharmaceutical Group. Under the companies’ agreement, AstraZeneca agreed to pay CSPC $100 million upfront, up to $1.92 billion tied to achieving development and commercialization milestones, plus tiered royalties. Other pharmas targeting Lp(a) within their pipelines include Amgen and Novartis. As for Merck and Hengrui, their collaboration deal is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Merck said it expected to record a pre-tax charge of $200 million, or approximately $0.06 per share, to be included in GAAP and non-GAAP results in the quarter during which the transaction will close. Investors reacted to news of the deal by sending Hengrui shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange up 1.17%, to CNY 44.87 ($6.18) at the close of trading today. Merck shares on the New York Stock Exchange nearly 5% from yesterday’s close of $92.31, to $88.03 as of 1:11 p.m. ET. “We are pleased to partner with Merck, a global leader in cardiovascular care. We believe Merck’s clinical expertise and global scale will help accelerate the development of HRS-5346 and potentially provide more patients with an additional option to reduce their risk of atherosclerosis,” added Frank Jiang, MD, PhD, Hengrui’s executive vice president and chief strategy officer.

        "description": "Courtesy of Merck; Karan Singh for BIPharmaceutical giants such as J&J, Merck, and Eli Lilly are embracing AI and prioritizing upskilling.They hope that training thousands of employees on generative AI will boost productivity in drug development.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.Johnson & Johnson is embracing the concept of a bilingual employee — but not in the classic sense.For the pharmaceutical company, literacy is needed in specialized and core job skills, including research, supply chain, and finance. Then there's fluency in AI technology.\"There are so many ways we've been using AI,\" said Jim Swanson, the chief information officer of J&J. \"But to do that effectively, we had to really create a curriculum and a mindset around upskilling.\"More than 56,000 of J&J's 138,000 workers have taken a generative AI training course, which is required before any employee is authorized to use the technology. After training, J&J's employees can utilize generative AI tools for summarization and prompt engineering, the latter a skill to ask the right question to get the best output from a large language model. A separate, more in-depth digital boot camp that covers topics including AI, augmented reality, and automation has recorded more than 37,000 cumulative hours of training from more than 14,000 employees.Generative AI offers the promise of more quickly identifying compounds for new treatments and vaccines, accelerating drug development, streamlining regulatory compliance, optimizing which patients are best suited for clinical trials, and improving how new drugs are marketed.Deborah Golden, Deloitte's US chief innovation officer, said these advancements were poised to change which skills the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes in recruitment. Biology and chemistry knowledge will still be needed, but it isn't as essential for newer roles like AI engineers, and other new roles might require a mix of traditional expertise and AI know-how if AI-driven drug discovery proliferates.\"When you think about how AI is shifting the balance and the talent requirements, you really need to be able to speak both the language of biology and AI models,\" Golden said.How AI is changing drug developmentGenerative AI could save the pharmaceutical industry tens of billions of dollars each year through improved productivity within drug development.J&J, the maker of treatments like the immunosuppressive drug Stelara and Darzalex, a medication for treating the cancer multiple myeloma, has used more traditional forms of AI for almost a decade. Use cases include AI-enabled software tools that can guide a surgeon through a procedure, speed up drug discovery, and help drug makers manage inventory more effectively.In 2023, J&J piloted a six-week digital immersion program that focused on AI, data science, and other emerging technologies. More than 2,500 employees participated last year, taking 90-minute classes each week, and J&J is planning further expansion this year.Swanson told Business Insider it was critical for company leaders to create a culture that promotes technological literacy. \"We've been around 135 years. We've had to reinvent ourselves multiple times to stay relevant and current,\" he said.The pharmaceutical giant Merck's early generative AI investments included the development of a proprietary platform called GPTeal. Merck — which is responsible for the HPV vaccine Gardasil and the immunotherapy drug Keytruda — said that GPTeal gives employees access to large language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Anthropic's Claude while keeping company data secure from external exposures.Employees are also using generative AI to draft emails and memos and for other productivity-focused tasks, but Merck's aspirations are also getting bolder.\"Now, the journey is clearly to identify, implement, track, and measure use cases that have a dramatic impact on our business,\" said Ron Kim, a senior vice president and the chief technology officer of Merck.Generative AI allows Merck's employees more time to focus on higher-impact tasks. In drug discovery, for example, generative AI can help draft (human-reviewed) regulatory documents that are submitted to health authorities. \"We felt like some of our scientists were taking time being copyeditors,\" Kim said. \"That's not what they trained for.\"Kim said more than 50,000 Merck employees were using GPTeal regularly. The company supported upskilling through a mix of self-serve digital training courses, monthly webcasts focused on generative AI, and boot camps for software developers that could last anywhere from half a day to 10 days.AI can appeal to pharmaceutical companies of various sizesDr. Daniel Stevens, the chief medical officer at Blue Earth Therapeutics, said AI was alluring to the clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company because, as a small startup founded in 2021, it has to be judicious with how it spends capital.\"The application of artificial intelligence is of interest, because it may help us with some of our efficiency goals,\" Stevens said.A $76.5 million Series A in October, which included funding from the healthcare investment firm Soleus Capital and the diagnostic imaging company Bracco Diagnostics, was mostly intended to support clinical trials that will assess the safety and effectiveness of new prostate cancer treatments.Stevens said that with just 20 full-time employees, Blue Earth has not yet needed to offer AI upskill training. He added that when Blue Earth grows its employee base and is ready to offer instruction about the technology, it plans to use online courses and AI certifications from external vendors.Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant behind treatments including the antidepressant Prozac and the type 2 diabetes and weight loss medicine Mounjaro, has used generative AI to support the research of both small and large molecules. The company also used AI to generate documentation for clinical trials and create materials for regulatory submissions.After ChatGPT launched, major employers such as Apple and Amazon restricted employee use of the popular chatbot, with many citing concerns about data privacy. \"We went in the exact opposite direction,\" said Diogo Rau, the chief information and digital officer at Eli Lilly.Rau encouraged Eli Lilly's workforce to embrace the tool without exposing sensitive company information, similar to how an employee might use Google Search.\"We told everybody you need to use it, you need to start bringing ChatGPT into your work,\" said Rau. But, he added, \"Don't put anything in there that you don't want to get out.\"The company also internally sought to bolster interest with an \"AI Games\" competition timed to the Summer Olympics in Paris. Contests involved using a chatbot to write a message to a colleague or relying on generative AI to make a quiz about Eli Lilly's history.In 2024, Eli Lilly also encouraged all employees and managers to use generative AI for their year-end reviews. This year, the company is set to require all senior leaders and managers to obtain an AI certification.\"We've got a workforce that is embracing AI,\" Rau said, adding that employees often stopped him in the office or emailed him to share the ways they were applying AI to their daily work tasks.Read the original article on Business Insider Courtesy of Merck; Karan Singh for BIPharmaceutical giants such as J&J, Merck, and Eli Lilly are embracing AI and prioritizing upskilling.They hope that training thousands of employees on generative AI will boost productivity in drug development.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.Johnson & Johnson is embracing the concept of a bilingual employee — but not in the classic sense.For the pharmaceutical company, literacy is needed in specialized and core job skills, including research, supply chain, and finance.
