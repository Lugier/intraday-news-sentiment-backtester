Title: Women’s Soccer Set To Be Fifth Most Popular Sport In The World By 2030
Date: 2025-06-17 09:45:34
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While PepsiCo is mentioned in the description alongside Nielsen Sports, the news itself regarding women's soccer growth has no direct, immediate impact on PEP's core financials or operations in the next 60 minutes. The projected growth by 2030 is a long-term trend and lacks the quantifiable surprise needed for an immediate, significant price movement, especially considering the generic nature of the sponsorship mention.

Title: Frito-Lay shutting down production at Southern California plant
Date: 2025-06-12 20:50:46
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Shutting down a production plant, even a single one, signals potential supply chain disruptions or decreased production efficiency.

Title: Addison Rae’s New Hit Single Brings Several Other Recent Wins With It
Date: 2025-06-12 15:45:57
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news mentions "Diet Pepsi" returning in an Addison Rae song, but this is unlikely to have a significant, direct impact on PEP's revenue or market share within the next 60 minutes. The news is more about Addison Rae's music career than any quantifiable boost to Diet Pepsi sales or brand perception in the short term. There's no significant surprise factor or quantifiable data to suggest a price movement in the immediate future.

Title: 10 dividend stocks to watch ahead of this week's inflation reports | $DVY $IBM $CSCO $PEP $TXN
Date: 2025-06-10 19:54:29
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news mentions PEP as one of several dividend stocks to watch. This inclusion is unlikely to have a significant, immediate impact on PEP's price because it's not a direct, surprising catalyst and doesn't contain specific, actionable information about PEP itself beyond being listed amongst other similar stocks.

Date: 2025-06-04 16:51:05

```

Title: Doritos, M&Ms Could Be Forced to Include Warning Labels in Texas
Date: 2025-06-03 01:04:51
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news about potential warning labels in Texas is likely to cause a negative knee-jerk reaction from traders. The direct impact on PEP stems from the potential decrease in sales of affected products like Mountain Dew within Texas (a key market). While the long-term effects are uncertain, the negative sentiment trigger associated with warning labels should outweigh any rational analysis in the short term, leading to immediate selling pressure.

Sentiment: neutral

Title: Tariff Rulings, Fannie-Freddie, FTC v. Pepsi: Votes and Verdicts
Date: 2025-05-30 11:00:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses tariff rulings and Fannie/Freddie, and mentions an FTC matter involving Pepsi. While the tariff rulings could indirectly impact PEP's supply chain and costs in the long run, the description does not specify a direct, immediate impact on PEP's profitability. Furthermore, the title suggests this is a summary of ongoing legal and policy matters, which may be already priced in, thus unlikely to trigger a significant price movement in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-05-30 07:58:19

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold PepsiCo Stock At $130?
Date: 2025-05-29 12:30:32
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title "Buy, Sell, Or Hold PepsiCo Stock At $130?" paired with the description mentioning "poor consumer sentiment and spending" and "mixed Q1 results" suggests immediate negative sentiment. This will likely trigger selling pressure within the next 60 minutes as traders react to the potential for downward revision of near-term expectations.
```

Title: How Olipop CEO Ben Goodwin built a brand new kind of soda brand
Date: 2025-05-29 12:00:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the article mentions PepsiCo indirectly through its former CEO being an investor and the purchase of Poppi, the news focuses primarily on Olipop and the broader healthy soda trend.

Date: 2025-05-29 06:01:00

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: FTC Nixes Antitrust Lawsuit Against PepsiCo Over Pricing
Date: 2025-05-22 23:13:23
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The dismissal of an antitrust lawsuit is a direct positive for PEP, removing a potential legal and financial burden (Direct Impact). The unanimous vote by the FTC likely surprised some investors (Magnitude & Surprise) and should reduce uncertainty, creating positive sentiment amongst short-term traders and leading to immediate buying pressure (Sentiment Trigger).

Title: PepsiCo officially adds Poppi to its brand portfolio as it looks to M&A for growth
Date: 2025-05-19 16:16:28
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The acquisition of Poppi signals PepsiCo's intent for growth through M&A, which is generally viewed positively by traders in the short term.

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: PepsiCo signs multi-year contract with AWS
Date: 2025-05-13 13:08:52
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While a multi-year contract with AWS is generally positive, its immediate impact on PEP's revenue or costs within the next 60 minutes is likely negligible. The news lacks quantifiable data or surprise, and short-term traders are unlikely to react strongly to a cloud infrastructure deal. Therefore, the news itself won't likely cause a significant price deviation.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: If you happen to have a tattoo of the Mountain Dew logo, we have some great news for you
Date: 2025-05-13 11:30:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news is a minor marketing promotion. While creative, the limited scope and relatively small financial impact of the contest suggest no direct, significant effect on PEP's overall revenue or brand perception within the next 60 minutes. The surprise factor is low, and short-term traders are unlikely to react strongly to this promotional activity.

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news is a roundup including PEP, but lacks specific, surprising, or quantifiable information directly affecting PEP's immediate financial prospects. While dividend announcements are generally positive, the inclusion of PEP in a broader roundup without specific dividend details means the impact within 60 minutes is likely minimal and already priced in. No strong sentiment trigger is apparent.

Date: 2025-05-09 13:06:17
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses a "civil war" in private credit related to a Tropicana debt deal. While PepsiCo owns Tropicana, this news focuses on creditor dynamics and doesn't provide quantifiable data or directly impact PEP's revenue, costs, or market share in an immediately actionable way for short-term traders. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant price deviation in PEP within the next 60 minutes.
```

Date: 2025-05-08 20:52:14
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the article mentions Coke and Pepsi as examples of competitive pairings, the primary focus is on Amazon and Walmart's advancements in robotics and retail technology.

Date: 2025-05-08 19:19:33

Date: 2025-05-06 13:00:00
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news indicates an increased investment in sports marketing, particularly related to the World Cup. This suggests a proactive effort to boost brand visibility and potentially increase sales, which short-term traders may interpret favorably as a growth catalyst in the immediate term. The image of Nick Sirianni being showered with Gatorade, although from a hypothetical future event, reinforces this positive brand association.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: How Ambani's Campa Cola is Hurting Coke, Pepsi in India
Date: 2025-05-06 07:33:26
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news suggests increased competition for PepsiCo in a major market (India) from a well-funded rival (Reliance).

Date: 2025-04-29 13:24:51
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Coca-Cola reporting higher organic sales growth than PepsiCo will likely trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders. The news directly relates to PEP's competitive position and may be interpreted as a sign of underperformance relative to a key competitor, potentially leading to immediate selling pressure. Although it is a competitor comparison, its relative performance against PEP within the same organic sales area creates negative pressure on PEP.

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the news highlights the growing popularity of healthier soda alternatives, there's no immediate, quantifiable impact on PEP's financials within the 60-minute window. The article simply notes that these alternatives are drawing attention from PepsiCo, suggesting potential competition but without any concrete actions or market share shifts reported. The impact is more likely to be long-term and doesn't constitute a significant surprise that would trigger immediate trading activity.

Date: 2025-04-25 11:30:15
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title and description explicitly state a 3% decrease in PEP stock following an announcement and attribute this drop to a less favorable outlook.

Date: 2025-04-24 19:14:22

Date: 2025-04-24 13:42:50
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title explicitly states a seasonal Q/Q decline across all business segments in Q1.

Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Cutting the full-year profit outlook indicates a direct negative impact on PEP's financial performance, specifically revenues and earnings. The news description highlights "wobbling" demand and "worsening consumer sentiment," signaling immediate short-term concerns for traders. This meets a catalyst check for negative earnings revisions, increasing the likelihood of a price decrease within the next 60 minutes due to negative sentiment.

Date: 2025-04-24 12:01:21
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The EPS miss, albeit slight at $0.01, carries a significant negative sentiment trigger, especially in the immediate aftermath of the release.

While Porcini's move to Samsung might be viewed as a neutral or even slightly positive event in the long run for the design industry, the immediate effect on PEP in the next 60 minutes will likely be slightly negative due to the potential for short-term uncertainty about the future of PepsiCo's design strategy.

The high price tag, especially for a brand originating on "Shark Tank," may be perceived as an overpayment by short-term traders, triggering a negative sentiment and slight selling pressure within the 60-minute window. The cost is significant and might raise questions about capital allocation, thus increasing the likelihood of a temporary dip.
