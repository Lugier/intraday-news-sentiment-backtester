        "explanation": "The news suggests a potential shift away from using US dollars for international trade, which could negatively impact US Bancorp's currency sales and international transaction revenues.

        "explanation": "The news describes a re-launch of a crypto custody offering, which doesn't present a clear, immediate positive or negative impact.
