Amazon says its annual Prime Day sale is doubling in size this summer. [contact-form-7] The retail giant announced Tuesday (June 17) that the event will stretch over four days instead of the usual two, running from July 8 through July 11. Also new this year is something called “Today’s Big Deals.” According to Amazon’s announcement, these are “themed daily deal drops” exclusive to Prime members. “Members can enjoy deep discounts across top brands like Samsung, Kiehl’s, and Levi’s,” the announcement said. “These special offers launch daily at midnight PDT and remain available for a limited time, while supplies last. Members can also check back frequently to discover incredible savings with deals dropping as often as every five minutes during select periods throughout the event.” The expanded version of Prime Days comes as Amazon is seeing more of its members also hold subscriptions to Walmart+, as recent PYMNTS Intelligence research has shown. “Far from being an either-or decision, a significant segment of the U.S. population, particularly millennials, is choosing to ‘win both carts’ by leveraging the distinct advantages offered by these retail giants,” PYMNTS wrote in May. This shift reflects consumers’ changing priorities and spending patterns that payments executives need to grasp to understand to the future of retail and commerce. The jump in dual subscriptions has been notable, that report added, nearly doubling since 2021 and suggesting a move toward multi-platform loyalty over exclusivity, fueled by a desire to maximize perks and value to combat ongoing inflation. “Consumers are increasingly choosing the best offerings from each retailer to meet their specific needs, rather than committing themselves to just one,” PYMNTS wrote. “This strategic approach allows them to compare prices and find the best deals, underscoring the perceived value of combined benefits, even among households facing tight budgets.” Among the insights from the research is the clear division in how dual subscribers use each platform. Walmart dominates grocery buying, with nearly a third of American consumers making their most recent grocery purchase at Walmart, compared to just 1.3% at Amazon. By contrast, Amazon maintains a hold on online discretionary retail, with both dual subscribers, and Prime-only members, using the platform for nonessential, higher-ticket items. “Perhaps the most compelling finding for payments executives is that subscribers to both Amazon Prime and Walmart+ consistently outspend other consumer segments on retail purchases at Amazon,” the report added. “Dual subscribers averaged $110 per transaction on Amazon, significantly higher than Prime-only members ($78), Walmart+-only members ($75), and those with neither subscription ($58).” The post Amazon Spins Prime Day Into 4-Day Event appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Amazon’s air logistics unit has started flying internationally for the first time from the U.S. to help fulfill e-commerce orders in Colombia and is leaning on a U.S. cargo airline to fly the aircraft and a Colombian airline for revenue on the return leg to Miami. The post Amazon uses 21 Air for new dedicated cargo service to Colombia appeared first on FreightWaves. Amazon’s private cargo airline, created to expedite online deliveries, has launched its first dedicated South American route with the help of two other carriers: 21 Air, a small U.S. freight operator, and Avianca, a major Latin American airline with a strong cargo arm. Amazon announced earlier this month the signing of Avianca Cargo as a customer for its new service that offers unused freighter space to third-party shippers. Avianca is booking shipments on Amazon Air backhaul flights from Bogotá, Colombia, to Miami that otherwise would be empty. The news release was issued by Amazon Air Cargo, the business unit that sells wholesale air cargo service to freight forwarders and other logistics operators, to highlight it is open for business to shippers in Colombia and the region. The announcement didn’t focus on the fact that in-house airline Amazon Air, which has an extensive transport network in the United States and more limited footprints in Europe and India, is now operating internationally, bringing to Colombia inbound parcels filled with goods ordered on its marketplace. The daily flights, which began on April 8 utilizing a Boeing 767-300 converted freighter, mark the first time Amazon Air has conducted cross-border flights, excluding activity in close-knit Europe. Amazon Air relies on partner airlines because it isn’t certified to fly commercial aircraft and doesn’t have its own pilots. It has a fleet of nearly 100 converted freighters, including 10 Airbus A330-300s and Boeing 737-800 narrowbody aircraft. FreightWaves identified 21 Air as the carrier operating the Miami-Bogota route on Amazon Air’s behalf, based on flight data from AirNav Radar. 21 Air, which began flying for Amazon in November, is based at Miami International Airport. It has a fleet of 16 Boeing 767s, six of which were supplied by Amazon. Amazon spokeswoman Gabriela Castillo confirmed that 21 Air is the underlying carrier for the Bogota service. 21 Air also operates in Amazon’s traditional parcel network between San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami and Amazon’s superhub at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport in Ohio. Avianca Cargo, which operates six Airbus A330-200 freighter aircraft in addition to managing shipments carried by the airline’s passenger fleet, said the northbound Amazon flights will be used to transport flowers and other products to the U.S. market. Miami is the largest U.S. gateway for fresh flowers. Amazon has been offering international shipping to Colombia since 2019. Prior to the new dedicated air cargo service it relied on ocean freight or other commercial airlines to move products to fulfillment warehouses in the country. In late May, it introduced the Amazon Prime paid subscription service for shoppers in Colombia. Membership includes free delivery from the U.S. to Colombia on eligible orders for tens of millions of items Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America, including Colombia. Amazon also competes in the country with China’s AliExpress and local online platforms. Amazon has focused this year on finding areas of opportunity in Latin America where there is both demand to move Amazon sales and third-party export shipments to defray operating costs, General Manager Tom Bradley said on a recent episode of The Loadstar podcast. “And we’ve done that in Colombia” where there is a “booming” e-commerce market and strong flows of perishable shipments to the United States, he said. “It’s a key route for us [because] we can combine synergies for Amazon customers with Amazon Air Cargo customers in the form of Avianca.” Amazon Air Cargo entered the for-hire airfreight market in September. Other customers listed on its website include Apex Logistics, a subsidiary of Kuehne+Nagel; DHL Express; and Miami-based ALK Global Logistic. Bradley reiterated that non-Amazon shippers benefit from Amazon’s rigorous delivery standards, dense network, spare aircraft and technology, which allow the company to quickly adjust capacity to unexpected circumstances or demand fluctuations. During the run-up to Mother’s Day in May, for example, Amazon Air implemented contingency plans to get a freighter assigned to the Miami-Bogotoa route back in service within 16 hours after it experienced a mechanical issue. Flower volumes were heavy during that period, but Amazon was able to quickly catch up on the temporary backlog, he said. Shippers can tender loads on an ad hoc basis, reserve guaranteed blocks of space or charter entire aircraft through Amazon Air Cargo. The majority of business in Europe is charter volume, particularly to European islands like Malta, Cyprus and Guernsey, Bradley told The Loadstar podcast. In Europe, Amazon uses several Boeing 737-800s. “Building out our scheduled service and giving customers access to the network that exists for Amazon customers are really the key focus right now,” Bradley said in the interview.

        "description": "The most inaccurately named sale of the year will soon be held again—so get your wallets ready. Amazon has announced that its annual Amazon Prime Day sales event will take place next month from July 8-11. Yes, Amazon Prime “Day” is now four days long—twice as long as in previous years. Here’s everything you need to know about the summer’s biggest shopping event. Amazon Prime “Day” is now closer to a week long Back on July 15, 2015, Amazon held its first Amazon Prime Day. The now-annual event sees millions of items on Amazon go on sale for Prime members. It’s a way to reward them for subscribing to Amazon’s subscription delivery service, and the event also acts as a promotion for the service and an incentive to get other Amazon shoppers to subscribe. The inaugural 2015 Amazon Prime Day was true to its name—the event lasted just one day. It also lasted just one day when it was held the following year in 2016. But from 2017 until last year, Amazon extended Amazon Prime Day into a two-day sales event. So I know what you’re thinking: This year Amazon has stretched Amazon Prime “Day” to three days, right? Wrong. Amazon has now announced that Amazon Prime “Day” is now a four-day event. Yep, in Amazon’s world, one day now equals 96 hours. From a math perspective, at this point it would just make more sense for Amazon to round up the “Amazon Prime Day” moniker to “Amazon Prime Week” instead of keeping the name rounded down. What are the new dates? Amazon Prime Day 2025 will kick off in the second week of July. The four-day event begins at 12:01 a.m. PDT on Tuesday, July 8, and runs until Friday, July 11. “With the summer shopping event returning, for the first time for 4 days, Prime members have double the time to shop millions of deals with savings on pantry staples and snacks for summer gatherings to home-improvement must-haves, back-to-school supplies, health and personal care finds, family-favorite toys, best-selling books, pet essentials, and even premium and luxury splurges,” Amazon said in its announcement. Does every country have Prime Day? Amazon will be holding Prime Day in most of the countries in which it operates. However, while some countries will see Prime Day 2025 fall on July 8-11 this year, other countries will need to wait until later in the year to experience Prime Day. Amazon says the countries that will have Prime Day on July 8-11 include: Australia Austria Belgium Canada Colombia France Germany Italy Ireland Japan Luxembourg The Netherlands Poland Portugal Singapore Spain Sweden Türkiye United States United Kingdom Prime Day 2025 will happen later in the year for additional countries. However, Amazon has not revealed an exact date. The company says Prime members in the following countries “can shop Prime Day deals later this summer”: Brazil Egypt India Mexico Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates What are the best Amazon Prime Day deals? Every Amazon Prime Day event sees millions of items go on sale for Prime members—from apparel to pet supplies to tech. But for this year’s Amazon Prime Day, the company is also doing things a little differently. In addition to the regular swath of sale items, Amazon will also be holding time-limited deal sales during the event. These sales will be on select items and will be announced at midnight PDT on each day of the sales event. Amazon is calling these time-limited sales “Today’s Big Deals,” and says the items will only remain on sale while supplies last. In other words, this is Amazon’s way of ensuring that people come back to its website repeatedly during the event—hoping they spend more each time. Amazon says its inaugural “Today’s Big Deals” items will include products from brands including Samsung, Kiehl’s, and Levi’s. How does Prime Day help Amazon’s bottom line? While Amazon bills Prime Day as a sales event designed to celebrate and reward its Prime subscribers, the event naturally benefits its own already-deep pockets. Last year, Amazon announced that its 2024 Prime Day was its biggest ever, with the company selling more than 200 million items during the 48-hour event. As Prime Day has become more popular, Amazon’s brick-and-mortar competitors have started to hold their own annual summer sales to coincide with Prime Day. However, many of these retailers, including Target and Walmart, hold their sales for a longer period than Amazon Prime Day’s historic 48 hours. Sky Canaves, principal analyst at Emarketer, said in a research note, “Amazon’s competitors had piggybacked off its success by launching their own July sales events, often up to a week long, and their revenues during Prime Day had been growing at a faster rate than Amazon’s.” Canaves went on to say that this year’s doubling of the length of Amazon Prime Day “will mark a major reversal in that trend.” “With this year’s expansion to four days, Amazon is shaking up what had become a fairly predictable Prime Day playbook,” Canaves said. “We expect Amazon to capture 75% of US ecommerce sales during this period—compared with less than 60% in last year’s two-day format.” According to Emarketer’s data, Amazon two-day Prime Day sales totaled $8.47 billion last year. The research firm predicts that Amazon’s four-day sales this year will generate $12.93 billion in sales over the 96-hour event. How much does Amazon Prime Day cost? To participate in Amazon Prime Day 2025, you’ll need to be a current Amazon Prime subscriber during the period from July 8 to July 11. Amazon Prime subscriptions in the United States cost $14.99 per month or $139 per year. Amazon also offers a free 30-day trial for eligible customers. Even if you are a subscriber to Amazon Prime on a free trial offer, you’ll still be able to take advantage of all the sales Amazon Prime Day offers.",

        "description": "An Amazon data center on the edge of Loudoun Meadows — one of many neighborhoods in northern Virginia witnessing data center development.Greg Kahn for BIMustafa Kaya thought he had found his perfect home in a Northern Virginia neighborhood called Amberleigh Station, drawn to the serenity of the evergreen woods that border his backyard. As a data scientist and first-time homeowner, Kaya wanted a quiet place where he could raise his family. Then came the noise: Google was building a data center on the other side of those trees.Equipment testing can be so loud that Kaya once resorted to sleeping in the basement for two nights. The neighborhood air carries wafts of diesel fumes.Kaya's neighbor Donna Gallant said she had awakened to jackhammering before 6 a.m. — and was considering restarting the antianxiety medications she's been free of for years. A homeowner in another neighborhood in the county said blasting for a data center project there cracked their drywall. The droning of the cooling fans from the now-operating facility has disturbed one family's young son, who they say has had nightmares about aliens landing a spaceship outside their home.These are just some of the impacts on Virginia residents grappling with an unprecedented construction boom for data centers, the large warehouses filled with computer servers powering artificial intelligence and cloud computing.The influx has brought new jobs and more tax revenue to pay for community improvements. It also has fueled discord in Prince William County, where Kaya and his neighbors live, roiling local politics over the impact on housing, the environment, and a national park at the site of the first major Civil War battle. The changes are pitting homeowners devoted to their quality of life against other residents looking to sell to the next data center project, and have swept up elected officials trying to find some middle ground.The region is the epicenter of an AI-driven construction wave rippling across America. A Business Insider analysis of US data centers found that many are located in population centers, where they bring disruption as well as opportunity. Indeed, of the 1,240 data centers that have been built or approved in the country, Business Insider found that roughly half are within a mile of at least 5,000 people. (See here for more on Business Insider's methodology.) The data center industry first took root next door in Virginia's Loudoun County, which has approved permits for 176 facilities or clusters of data centers called \"campuses.\" Loudoun, nicknamed Data Center Alley, became a tech magnet almost by accident. The early internet service provider UUNet Communications helped establish one of the world's largest exchange points beneath Loudoun, strategically near Washington, DC, and roughly halfway down the Atlantic seaboard. State officials seeking new investment and jobs offered one of the earliest industry tax breaks, and county authorities rolled out the red carpet, offering an advantageous regulatory regime.A massive data center campus under construction in the middle of \"Data Center Alley\" in Northern Virginia, the nation's largest cluster of data centers.Greg Kahn for BIThe facilities were smaller then, often clustered in corporate office parks. As the buildings got bigger and more numerous, companies started scanning for sites slightly farther afield. Prince William now has 77 campuses built or underway, including 40 owned by Amazon.In December, Virginia's legislature took a step back to assess. \"The industrial scale of data centers makes them largely incompatible with residential uses,\" auditors with the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found in their 156-page report. And yet, the report says, local ordinances allowed data centers to be built cheek by jowl with residential neighborhoods, or local officials signed off on zoning exceptions or rezonings that accomplished the same thing.Now, almost a third of the operating data centers in the state are sited within 200 feet of residential areas.Google declined to comment on the complaints of Kaya and his neighbors, but it and other data center companies say their investments benefit the local economy and community. Some residents also welcome the data center boom, which they see as providing needed tax revenue without overburdening public infrastructure like roads or schools. Loudon counts itself among the fastest-growing counties in America with a population over 100,000. Homeowners have watched the median sales price rise more than 70% over the past decade.Residents are drawn to a quality of life enabled, in part, by tax revenue from data centers, Buddy Rizer, the county's executive director of economic development, said in an interview. Loudoun County collected $875 million in tax revenue from data centers in its 2024 fiscal year, which Rizer said had helped fund schools, transportation, and other services — and a tax cut that he said was saving homeowners about $3,500 a year on average.That surging population is heightening competition for open space and making it more likely that data centers are close to population centers. Prince William County's bucolic environs are vanishing. Kaya's scenic backyard view is now marred by a line of orange surveyor's tape snaking through the trees, marking the boundaries for future development.The Amazon data center by Loudoun Meadows looms over a small park.Greg Kahn for BISome are racing to get out. One resident of Amberleigh Station quickly put their house up for sale after receiving a certified letter, with an enclosed map, alerting residents to a forthcoming project that would clear the trees surrounding the community on three sides to build 11 data centers.\"I took one look at it and said we are not going to do that,\" said the former resident. \"That's not a good quality of life.\" The couple ended up selling what they once thought was their \"forever home\" for more than the listing price and moving to another county in Virginia.Others are trying to exit strategically, seeking to organize their neighbors to sell their homes together to the highest data center bidder. Gallant said she had been in talks to do that within Amberleigh Station. Efforts are underway elsewhere in the county.A group of property owners along Pageland Lane, in a northern part of the county, became the first large group to begin selling to the data centers in 2021. For nearly $1 million an acre for some, they agreed to sell some 2,100 acres to Compass Datacenters and QTS, a data center company owned by the Wall Street investing giant Blackstone.The resulting project, known as the Prince William Digital Gateway, is expected to transform part of the county's protected rural area and nestle up against Manassas National Battlefield Park, which commemorates the first and second battles of Bull Run.The proposed sale ignited a backlash that resulted in the departure of at least two county supervisors. One, Pete Candland, reversed his opposition to the Digital Gateway project around the time his property was included in its final footprint. In December 2022, Candland resigned after the Office of the Commonwealth's Attorney said it could be a conflict of interest for him to vote on future data center projects, he told Business Insider in an interview. Another supervisor, Ann Wheeler, lost a primary in 2023 to a challenger who campaigned on criticism of data centers.Wheeler told Business Insider that the issue wasn't the only reason she lost, but that \"many of the opponents of the data center issue jumped on not because they were affected by a data center but because NIMBYism has advanced to BANANAism. Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone.\"For many residents, the data centers' sound rankles the most, a relentless whir of fans and cooling equipment that drowns out nature, invades conversation, and impedes sleep.Amazon and other companies say they invest significantly in noise control efforts. Even when they do, the issue can fuel tensions with residents.Carlos Yanes' home sits higher than many of his neighbors' in the Great Oak neighborhood in Prince William. Where that once provided a welcoming perch to hear the surrounding wildlife, it now puts him within range of the noise coming from Amazon's data centers. He has felt the sound inside his house for most of the three years the facility has been operating and said he had to move his family's sleeping quarters to the basement to get any rest.Yanes, who works in the heating and cooling industry, spent almost $20,000 to replace his windows but it didn't fix the problem, he said, standing in his backyard and raising his voice to be heard over a low drone from the Amazon facility. He says his son has been having nightmares in which the noise is actually a spaceship that has landed in the yard. \"It's not a good thing to be experiencing as a kid,\" he said.The challenge for public officials is that noise ordinances are typically crafted to capture intermittent noises, like firecrackers or house parties or jackhammers, not the constant drone given off by a data center. Yanes has been collecting sound measurements from his deck and sharing them with Dale Browne, his homeowner association's former president. Their readings show that the lower-frequency data center noise driving Yanes' family to sleep in the basement doesn't often violate existing ordinances, which are written to measure standard midrange sounds.According to the American Public Health Association, chronic noise exposure can lead to serious health problems, including cardiovascular disease, sleep disruption, and increased stress that can cause psychological disorders or early death. Children are among the most vulnerable.Browne has shared Yanes' noise findings with county officials and executives at Amazon, which beginning in 2022 made changes such as adding sound-dampening material to the fans and changing the shutters that allow air in and out of th",

        "description": "When you search for a product online, the order in which it appears might be quietly costing you money. A new study from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University has found that online shopping platforms, like Amazon or Expedia, can unknowingly help pricing algorithms push prices higher, simply by how they rank products for you. The key issue lies in how these websites decide the order of products you see. Instead of showing the same product order to everyone, many websites use your past behavior to tailor the ranking, putting what they think you’ll like best at the top. That sounds helpful. But it turns out, this personalization can make it easier for sellers using AI-powered pricing tools to charge more. The researchers created a simulated online marketplace to test how two types of product rankings affect pricing: Personalized ranking, which customizes the product order for each shopper. Unpersonalized ranking, which shows the same order to all shoppers, based on general product data like quality and price. They also used smart pricing algorithms, specifically reinforcement learning models, that learn over time to set prices for products in a competitive environment. These algorithms don’t need any coordination between sellers, they learn from trial and error what prices make the most money. The result? Personalized rankings gave those algorithms more room to push prices up. Here’s why: when rankings are tailored to each shopper, people tend to look at fewer products. If the one they want is already on top, they don’t scroll further. This behavior gives sellers less reason to cut prices to compete for attention. Under unpersonalized rankings, on the other hand, shoppers are more likely to browse around. This pushes sellers to compete harder on price, which keeps things more affordable. In their tests, the algorithms charged 29% higher prices on average when using personalized rankings compared to unpersonalized ones. Profits jumped by 74%, but consumer satisfaction, measured as the balance of value and effort in searching, fell by 13%. This shows that personalization, even without charging different people different prices, can still hurt consumers, Their findings stayed consistent across various tweaks to the model, whether search costs went up or down, or whether there were more sellers. This study doesn’t accuse any specific platform of wrongdoing. Instead, it reveals a subtle design issue: features meant to help consumers can backfire when combined with smart algorithms built to maximize profit. What does this mean for everyday shoppers? It means the convenience of personalized rankings might come with hidden costs. And it means policymakers and tech companies may need to rethink how personalization works, especially when paired with AI pricing tools. The researchers say one simple fix could be rethinking how products are ordered in search results. By favoring more neutral or transparent ranking methods, platforms might keep prices fairer without hurting product discovery. For now, if you’re shopping online, it may pay to scroll a little further down the page.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: New Study Reveals Silent Data Theft from Offline PCs via Smartwatches",

        "description": "Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have invited celebrity friends like fellow space traveler Katy Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Mick Jagger, and Ivanka Trump for their Venice nuptials later this month, but the couple hopes to put a spotlight on Venice’s traditions during the celebrations.They are sourcing some 80% of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors, according to people close to the couple, as a way to share their appreciation for the romantic lagoon city. The wedding will take place over three days in late June, with events for the some 200 invited guests kept private.Two historic Venetian companies will add artisanal touches to the celebration: Rosa Salva, the city’s oldest pastry maker that has been crafting donut-shaped fishermen’s biscuits since 1876, and Laguna B, a design studio known for its distinctive handblown Murano glass prized by fashion and design clients. Treats good for fishermen and VIPs alike Antonio Rosa Salva, the 6th generation in his family to run the business, said the wedding order of a selection of surprises for goody bags was important recognition of his family’s long tradition of baking Venetian specialties dating back nearly 150 years.They include the bussola buttery biscuit that was long a fisherman’s staple, and small zaletti cookies, made from the Veneto region’s corn meal, flavored with raisins and lemon zest.“We try to maintain the old recipes,” said Rosa Salva, whose family business includes a catering service and four locations in Venice’s historic center and one on the mainland. “We do everything with love. It’s a pleasure and a privilege.”Rosa Salva, whose business regularly caters large events for 1,000 or more people in Venice, is perplexed by posters that have gone up around the historic center protesting the use of the city as a venue for the Bezos-Sanchez wedding.“Events like this bring quality tourism to Venice,” he said. “I don’t see how an event with 200 people can create disruptions. It’s responsible tourism. It’s prestigious that a couple like this, who can go anywhere in the world, are getting married in the city.” Collectible glassware with social responsibility Laguna B was founded by Marie Brandolini, who became known as the glass countess, in 1994, and the company is now being guided by her son, Marcantonio Brandolini, from the family’s palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal.The younger Brandolini said his vision is to restore the Venetian tradition of running creative enterprises out of Venice’s grand palazzi, which historically dedicated the ground floor to work spaces for the merchant nobility. His is a good example. The company employs 14 people under 30 out of offices in the courtyard and a boutique in an adjacent alleyway, in a sector, he underlined, “not related to tourism.”His upstairs neighbors are Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller—close friends of Bezos and Sanchez, but he doesn’t think that is why the wedding planner picked his company, which is well known among a small network of collectors.Laguna B won’t disclose what its master glassblowers on Murano have created for the wedding, but the company is known for distinctive glassware that at times feature an undulating lip—no two alike.“I hope they like what we did for them,” Brandolini said. “For us, it’s a great opportunity, it gives extra support for our growth.”While the business thrives on such important orders, Brandolini said he is equally gratified by young, discerning customers who seek out the shop because they admire Laguna B’s commitment to community building, reviving Venice’s artisanal heritage and projects to help protect the fragile lagoon. They might buy just a single drinking glass.His is a message of inclusivity, which he also applies to the Bezos-Sanchez choice of wedding venue. “The world is for everybody. Whoever wants to do something, should be able to do it, following the law,” he said. Venice protests Unsurprisingly in a city whose future is fiercely debated at every turn, the wedding has attracted the attention of protesters, who on Thursday hung a banner on St. Mark’s bell tower with Bezos’ name crossed out. They cite the risk of disruptions in a city so overrun with mass tourism that officials are for a second year requiring day-trippers to pay a tax to enter on key summer days.City officials have pledged that services will function normally during the wedding, and issued a denial in late March to reports that the wedding organizers had booked half the city’s water taxis and blocked out rooms at luxury hotels.“We are very proud,” Mayor Luigi Brugnaro told the Associated Press this week in St. Mark’s Square, saying he hoped he would get the chance to meet Bezos. “I don’t know if I will have time, or if he will, to meet and shake hands, but it’s an honor that they chose Venice. Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage.” —Colleen Barry, Associated Press",

But they're doing that by duplicating last Thursday's and Friday's orders.That scares me to death because there will be a number of items we really don't want duplicated from last week. For example, we had a special order for a customer who needed six cases of potato salad. It's perishable. If we get six more cases, we'll have to do a fire sale just to get rid of them.What we've thought about — and hope doesn't happen — is a panic. Up here in the desert, there are a couple of Hispanic grocery chains that are also supplied by UNFI. Then, there's the independents like ourselves.

But it's been very difficult for them. They don't know what to expect.Stores like mine have few wholesaler optionsI buy a majority of the groceries in the store from UNFI.A few decades ago, there were more wholesaler options. If you were unhappy with one company, you could go to another distributor here in Southern California. We used to work with a co-op that distributed groceries, and we were spoiled. They knew the market because they were part of it.Now, with UNFI, more choices are made in Minnesota, where the company has an office. How can you tell in Minnesota what works in Southern California?UNFI used to be smaller than it is today. Then it bought SuperValu, a larger grocery distributor. It was a little fish eating an alligator.Today, what are our alternatives? There aren't any. We have to buy from UNFI.

They don't know what to expect.Stores like mine have few wholesaler optionsI buy a majority of the groceries in the store from UNFI.A few decades ago, there were more wholesaler options. If you were unhappy with one company, you could go to another distributor here in Southern California. We used to work with a co-op that distributed groceries, and we were spoiled. They knew the market because they were part of it.Now, with UNFI, more choices are made in Minnesota, where the company has an office. How can you tell in Minnesota what works in Southern California?UNFI used to be smaller than it is today. Then it bought SuperValu, a larger grocery distributor. It was a little fish eating an alligator.Today, what are our alternatives? There aren't any. We have to buy from UNFI. Around here, they're the only ones supplying independent grocery stores like us.Do you have a story to share about the UNFI outage?

Amazon reportedly aims to boost its efforts in the healthcare field by simplifying the structure of its health business. [contact-form-7] The company is reorganizing Amazon Health Services into six units, CNBC reported Friday (June 13), citing its interview with Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services. “Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,” Lindsay told CNBC. “One of the problems we’re trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that’s common in healthcare.” Some of the new units will be headed by longtime Amazon leaders, while others will be led by executives from Amazon’s primary care chain, One Medical, according to the report. The changes do not include broad layoffs, the report said. The restructuring follows the departure of some health leaders in 2025, including the chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, the CEO of One Medical and the chief medical officer of Amazon, per the report. Lindsay said that the departures were part of the natural evolution of the business and that the organization has “no shortage of depth of talent,” according to the report. The six new divisions of Amazon Health Services include One Medical Clinical Care Delivery; One Medical Clinical Operations and Performance; AHS Strategic Growth and Network Development; AHS Store, Tech and Marketing; AHS Compliance; and AHS Pharmacy Services, per the report. Both Amazon and its rival Walmart are competing for not only retail dollars but also other infrastructure of daily living, including healthcare, media and cloud services, PYMNTS reported in May. The company has been expanding its healthcare offerings such as virtual care and chronic condition management by forming strategic partnerships with companies like Teladoc and mental health providers, PYMNTS reported in January. By integrating these services into its larger ecosystem, Amazon seeks to redefine healthcare access and challenge Walmart’s established position in the industry. In November, Amazon added new health and beauty-related services to its healthcare offering by extending the Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit telehealth service, which offers care on a range of different conditions and the option of on-demand messaging visits with clinicians.

Here’s what food and drug regulation might look like under the Trump administration Earlier this week, two new leaders of the US Food and Drug Administration published a list of priorities for the agency. Both Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad are controversial figures in the science community. They were generally highly respected academics until the covid pandemic, when their contrarian opinions on masking, vaccines, and lockdowns turned many of their colleagues off them. Given all this, along with recent mass firings of FDA employees, lots of people were pretty anxious to see what this list might include—and what we might expect the future of food and drug regulation in the US to look like. So let’s dive into the pair’s plans for new investigations, speedy approvals, and the “unleashing” of AI. —Jessica Hamzelou This article first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review’s weekly biotech newsletter.

One more thing The surprising barrier that keeps us from building the housing we needIt’s a tough time to try and buy a home in America. From the beginning of the pandemic to early 2024, US home prices rose by 47%. In large swaths of the country, buying a home is no longer a possibility even for those with middle-class incomes. For many, that marks the end of an American dream built around owning a house. Over the same time, rents have gone up 26%.The reason for the current rise in the cost of housing is clear to most economists: a lack of supply. Simply put, we don’t build enough houses and apartments, and we haven’t for years. But the reality is that even if we ease the endless permitting delays and begin cutting red tape, we will still be faced with a distressing fact: The construction industry is not very efficient when it comes to building stuff.

Walmart and Amazon are actively exploring the issuance of their own stablecoins, a move that could upend the traditional payments ecosystem and potentially save these retail giants billions in transaction fees, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that other large multinationals, including Expedia Group and major airlines, are also considering similar initiatives, signaling a potential shift in how high-volume merchants handle payments in the U.S. [contact-form-7] Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — have gained traction as a means of storing value and facilitating crypto transactions. For merchants, the appeal is clear: bypassing legacy card networks could reduce interchange fees and accelerate settlement times, especially for cross-border transactions. The timing of these deliberations is closely tied to the legislative progress of the GENIUS Act, which is poised to become the nation’s first comprehensive stablecoin law. The bill, which recently cleared a key Senate procedural vote by a 68-30 margin, aims to establish clear rules for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring them to be fully reserved and subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. Proponents, including bill sponsor Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), argue that the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, spur innovation, and strengthen the U.S. dollar’s global standing. However, the bill has become a flashpoint for broader debates over financial regulation. More than 120 amendments have been proposed, including provisions unrelated to stablecoins, such as credit card fee caps and presidential trade powers. Those additions could turn the legislation into a battleground for the future of payments. Notably, Walmart has lobbied for an amendment to introduce more competition in the credit card sector, reflecting merchants’ longstanding frustration with card network fees. PYMNTS coverage highlights that the GENIUS Act would require stablecoin issuers to maintain robust capital and liquidity buffers, comply with anti-money laundering standards, and submit regular reserve attestations. The GENIUS Act’s fate remains uncertain, with a final Senate vote expected soon and House consideration to follow. Meanwhile, the digital asset sector is closely watching whether regulatory clarity will unleash a new wave of merchant-led innovation — or introduce fresh systemic risks. As the regulatory landscape evolves, the prospect of Walmart, Amazon, and other major retailers launching stablecoins underscores the urgency for banks, FinTechs and payment providers to adapt to a rapidly changing digital economy.

After all, Apple had promised a gen-AI-powered Siri ages ago, only to backtrack and put off a release indefinitely —… When Amazon announced in February a generative-AI-infused update to Alexa, dubbed Alexa+, it seemed as if the company had metaphorically jammed its flag into the moon’s surface, proclaiming itself the winner of the gen-AI voice-assistant race. After all, Apple had promised a gen-AI-powered Siri ages ago, only to backtrack and put off a release indefinitely — and then it barely mentioned Siri at the WWDC 2025 gathering in June. Google announced that its Gemini would replace Google Assistant, but the rollout has been slow and uneven, and commentary among Google device owners is that Google Home has become less reliable in the process. This week, however, Amazon announced that Alexa+ is already being used by more than a million people (I know of just one other, personally), and with the full release of Alexa+ being teased for summer 2025, the company has taken an early lead.With gen AI, there are two equally loud and disparate voices in my head, pulling my opinion to and fro. One Katy declares, “This is the way of the future, look at all of the good that can come of this, everything will be fine!” The other Katy sneers, “Why does this thing need to know my favorite color, anyway?”As Amazon promised, early access to Alexa+ is a bit of a lottery: You have to sign up to request access, which Amazon seems to grant randomly, and it is restricted to owners of specific Echo smart speaker models — and then you have to wait to be invited. I requested access and heard nothing until a couple of weeks ago, when a pop-up on my Echo Show 8 asked if I wanted to try early access. Without thinking twice, I accepted, unsure of what to expect. I was curious: Amazon may have planted its flag on the moon, but would that flag be AI slop, complete with uneven stripes and oddly shaped stars?Amazon’s main Alexa+ page highlights five key features of its upgraded assistant (which will be free for Prime members, otherwise $20 a month). The first is a more conversational Alexa, capable of longer chats, customized answers, and the ability to speak naturally or change the subject. The company also promises more fluid and useful third-party integrations that will allow you to use voice commands to book an Uber or a dinner reservation, or even plan a vacation. Amazon also says that Alexa+ is designed to fix one especially nagging limitation of the original version — the inability to be personalized to the user. The company has also promised improvements to smart-home control, as well as more ways to access Alexa+ on the go. Not all of those features are available yet, and most of them are very much a work in progress. But within moments of upgrading to Alexa+, I realized that the first feature was the star of the show and informed all the others.",

The everything consumer requires an everything retailer, and that’s the pole position that retail giants Amazon and Walmart have been battling for over the past two decades. [contact-form-7] The rivalry between Amazon and Walmart is no longer just about who sells more. It’s about who builds the more intelligent, responsive and interconnected ecosystem. Once purely retail competitors, the two giants are now diverging into multifaceted tech conglomerates, embedding artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, FinTech and robotics into their operational cores. The latest strategic maneuvers from both companies, over just the past week alone, reflect not just tactical business decisions but signal a structural transformation of what it means to be a modern retailer in the 21st century. Read more: Walmart and Amazon Chase Agentic AI, Robotic Warehouses and Customer Loyalty Inside the Next-Gen War Between Amazon and Walmart On Monday (June 9), Amazon unveiled a $20 billion investment to build two massive AI and cloud data‑center campuses in Pennsylvania — marking the largest private‑sector investment in the state’s history. Designed to supercharge the capabilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the initiative is part of a broader trend that sees cloud providers like Amazon shifting toward regional data hubs that integrate artificial intelligence at their core. The Pennsylvania campus is expected to serve dual roles: enhancing Amazon’s own AI-driven product development and offering enterprises advanced AI infrastructure solutions. The move aligns with Amazon’s broader commitment to AI innovation across its operational value chain. Amazon’s delivery forecasting systems, for example, are being reengineered using machine learning models that analyze real-time logistics data, customer behavior, and weather patterns. Amazon is also monetizing its AI assets in other verticals. Prime Video subscribers, for instance, are now experiencing ad-supported viewing tiers with up to six minutes of commercials per hour, a massive increase that has viewers conflicted. Amazon’s strategic play isn’t limited to technological infrastructure. The company is now integrating Whole Foods into its corporate structure more fully, shifting the grocery chain from a semi-autonomous subsidiary into a more direct part of Amazon’s operational ecosystem. This structural change signals deeper logistical and data synergies between Whole Foods and Amazon’s broader retail and supply chain apparatus. It also potentially paves the way for increased adoption of AI and automation technologies in grocery logistics — a sector still largely untouched by advanced robotics. The Whole Foods integration is emblematic of Amazon’s long-term vision: a fully unified ecosystem where physical and digital retail, logistics, cloud computing and entertainment services reinforce each other. Walmart’s FinTech Foray: OnePay and the New Retail Bank Meanwhile, in Bentonville, Walmart is scripting its own narrative. With the rapid expansion of its OnePay financial ecosystem, Walmart is positioning itself as not just a retailer but a de facto digital bank. The launch of a new credit program in partnership with Synchrony, combined with an expanded suite of OnePay digital services, places Walmart squarely in competition with traditional banking institutions. By embedding payment and credit options directly into its retail experience, Walmart is cultivating a stickier relationship with consumers — especially those who are underbanked or looking for low-friction financial alternatives. Walmart has also introduced “Sparky,” an AI shopping assistant designed to guide users through their purchasing journey. Sparky provides personalized product recommendations, navigates store layouts digitally, and even manages budget suggestions based on past behavior. This AI assistant is not only a tool for customer engagement but also a data-harvesting mechanism, feeding Walmart’s broader AI ecosystem. Walmart’s ambitions don’t end with FinTech. Facing rising operational costs due to global tariffs, Walmart is pivoting toward younger demographics in a bid to future-proof its consumer base. Through digital-first marketing, mobile commerce initiatives, and AI-enhanced customer service, Walmart is trying to reframe its brand identity for a new generation of shoppers. Gen Z, with its mobile-native behaviors and preference for personalized, ethical and digital experiences, presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Walmart’s multi-pronged strategy — FinTech services, AI shopping tools and socially conscious messaging — aims to build loyalty with this increasingly influential cohort. The Drone Frontier: A Glimpse Into Tomorrow’s Logistics While both Amazon and Walmart have been exploring drone delivery for years, 2025 marks a turning point. Amazon’s Prime Air and similar initiatives are moving from pilot programs to operational rollouts in select urban and suburban markets. These aerial logistics solutions are not just gimmicks; they are designed to solve last-mile delivery bottlenecks that ground transport struggles with. Whether delivering poolside prosecco or prescription medicine, drones represent a tangible convergence of AI, robotics, and logistics — a frontier both companies are racing to dominate.

        "description": "No one ever believes me when I tell them how much this Amazon outdoor sofa costs. It looks way more expensive than it really is. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreThe highlight of my \"outdoor living room\" is this cozy sofa, which just so happens to be one of my best budget finds ever. Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderMy spouse and I bought our first home in 2021 during the pandemic, trading in our tiny Brooklyn apartment with a deck for a cape-style house with a backyard and porch. To be honest, the porch looked a little rough when we first moved in — red-stained wood walls, old IKEA furniture, spiders from hell — but I had a vision!After a few years of prioritizing indoor renovations, we finally got around to doing a porch makeover in 2024, and I remember kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Having this huge new living space with freshly painted walls, a comfy sectional sofa, an outdoor TV, and a dining area had turned our crappy-looking porch into an indoor-outdoor oasis. And the best part was that we did it all on a major budget.The highlight of our \"outdoor living room\" is the cozy sofa, and it just so happens that this was also one of our best budget finds ever. When I began shopping for the sofa, I started my research with our buying guide to the best places to buy outdoor furniture online and found myself browsing Amazon (one of our team's go-tos for affordable finds) until I landed on a super cute, well-priced sectional from a brand called Lausaint with a ton of positive reviews and customer photos.The option we went with was a 6-piece, modular sectional for under $550.On the right is the Amazon listing photo, and on the left is what it looks like on our porch. I almost didn't order it because it felt hugely possible I was getting duped by fake reviews, but I'm so glad I did.Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderWe worried that the price was too good to be true, but we crossed our fingers and bought it anyway. A year later, I'm so glad we took the risk! This couch has been the backdrop for so many fun evenings with friends and breezy morning coffee dates with my spouse. Sure, it's not the kind of thing that will last a lifetime, but it has held up incredibly well so far, and I'm really pleased with the quality for what we paid.The couch also comes in an 8-piece configuration, so there are other options to consider. Plus, it's modular, so you can always reorganize or split it up into multiple seating areas. Our current configuration is about 111 inches wide and 55 inches deep on the ends with the ottomans. The product listing on Amazon has specs for each piece of the couch, so you can more accurately measure for the needs of your configurationAssembly was so easy and I love that the pieces are all modular so I can rearrange them whenever I want.I didn't take photos of the assembly process because I had no idea I'd be writing this review a year later — but here is the couch fully assembled.Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderThe couch is really easy to assemble and comes with all the tools you need. You're basically just connecting a base and a back, then attaching four legs to each piece. The legs even have little levelers on them in case your floor is uneven. The instructions are clear, and the visuals will guide you through each step.Whenever we have parties, it's also easy to move the ottoman pieces to the other side of the room so people can face each other. It's also nice knowing that there are a ton of configurations in case we ever totally rearrange the porch again.The couch is pretty comfy, but you might want to add some pillows and remember to rotate the seat cushions every once in a while.The seat cushions are comfy but not super thick. The ottoman cushions especially tend to slide around a bit (you can see on the left where the cushion has moved by an inch or two), but we ended up rectifying this issue with a little Velcro tape.Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderThe seat cushions aren't super dense or thick (they're about 4 inches tall), but they're also not too flimsy. The back and arm cushions are squishier than the seats, but I still recommend adding a few outdoor pillows to the couch to make it feel extra cushy.I've sat on the couch for hours at a time because it's my favorite work-from-home spot when the weather is nice, and I find that after a couple hours, the seat cushion has sunk in enough that I need to stand up and let it fluff back up. I rotate the seat cushions every couple weeks just to make sure I'm not wearing out the one in the spot I usually prefer.It's held up really well over the past year with just a little bit of care, but I would only buy this if your outdoor area is covered.For context, our porch is entirely covered. I probably wouldn't opt for this couch if our space were completely open to the elements.Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderOur porch screens let in a lot of pollen, rain, and dust, so the cushions get dirty easily. But I vacuum them every couple of weeks, and the material doesn't hold onto the dust or pollen particles at all. Even a year later, with just a little bit of care, the cushions still look brand new.We did buy a $50 cover for big storms where the wind blows a lot of extra water into our porch, but I've found that I barely need to use it. We also opted to buy some Velcro tape to keep the cushions more secure on the base, which has helped the couch feel a little more sturdy.It's worth considering that while the polyethylene rattan is fully waterproof, the legs are metal, so there's a significant chance they'll rust over time if left out in the rain. Plus, the cushions aren't designed to be soaked. That said, if you're really, really good about remembering to put a cover on the couch, you can probably get away with putting this on an open deck.The bottom line? This budget outdoor sofa from Amazon is a great value for screened-in or well-covered porches.Our cat loves hanging out on this couch. We like to keep a lot of blankets out there, especially in the colder months, so she has a cozy place to snuggle.Sally Kaplan/Business InsiderIf you've got the space for it, I highly recommend this couch. It's not the fanciest or most luxurious option, but it's an excellent pick if you're a budget-conscious shopper looking for flexible seating in a covered outdoor space.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "AdWeek report claims gradual uptick in ad load, which ad buyers confirm is growing. Amazon forced all Prime Video subscribers onto a new ad-based subscription tier in January 2024 unless users paid more for their subscription type. Now, the tech giant is reportedly showing twice as many ads to subscribers as it did when it started selling ad-based streaming subscriptions. Currently, anyone who signs up for Amazon Prime (which is $15 per month or $139 per year) gets Prime Video with ads. If they don’t want to see commercials, they have to pay an extra $3 per month. One can also subscribe to Prime Video alone for $9 per month with ads or $12 per month without ads. When Amazon originally announced the ad tier, it said it would deliver “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\" Based on “six ad buyers and documents” ad trade publication AdWeek reported viewing, Amazon has determined the average is four to six minutes of advertisements per hour.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "A possible cyberattack on a major food distributor is beginning to disrupt grocery supply chains. The post Whole Foods distributor remains hobbled following possible cyberattack appeared first on FreightWaves. As United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) works to address ongoing IT network issues, emails have surfaced on social media indicating the disruption could last until next week. UNFI announced it suspended its systems on Monday after the wholesale distributor of natural and organic food products identified unauthorized activity in its IT systems. The systems impacted are currently unspecified, and UNFI has yet to confirm whether or not the incident was caused by a cyberattack. No individuals or groups have claimed responsibility for the disruption to UNFI’s IT network. Kristen Jimenez, UNFI’s communications vice president, told FreightWaves the company is “working steadily” to safely restore its systems and resume services for its customers and suppliers. “As of today, we’re gradually bringing our ordering and receiving capabilities back online, with the goal of further increasing our capacity over the coming days,” Jimenez said in an email to FreightWaves. “The investigation is ongoing with the support of leading forensics experts. Our customers, suppliers, and associates are our highest priority. We continue to work closely with them to minimize disruptions as much as possible.” A post on X on Wednesday reportedly showed email correspondence between UNFI’s software management team and an unnamed vendor. “Between now and next Sunday, we plan to bring certain systems back online in a phased way, including basic order and fulfillment capabilities by Tuesday or Wednesday,” the email said.

        "description": "Whole Foods CEO and Amazon's Worldwide Grocery VP Jason BuechelMIKE BLAKE/REUTERSWhole Foods's corporate staff will transition to Amazon in meaningful ways.Amazon also restructured its grocery leadership team.This is one of the biggest changes to Amazon's grocery business since it acquired Whole Foods in 2017.Amazon is integrating Whole Foods more deeply into its core business, in a major reorganization that it hopes will reinvigorate its grocery business under new leadership.In an internal memo last week, Whole Foods CEO and Amazon VP of Worldwide Grocery Jason Buechel explained how the restructuring will bring the two companies closer together.The plan includes a new leadership team and a change that will bring Whole Foods corporate staff under Amazon's employee programs, including performance reviews and pay structure. The changes will happen over the next 12 months, but won't affect Whole Foods frontline warehouse and in-store workers, according to the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider.The previous structure failed to leverage \"the breadth of talent, resources, and knowledge\" across Amazon's grocery ecosystem and Whole Foods, Buechel wrote. The new approach, he added, is meant to streamline operations.\"Too frequently we are duplicating efforts and missing easy opportunities for efficiency,\" Buechel explained in the memo. \"We have a big opportunity to work smarter across teams and simplify how we approach shared needs.\"This is Amazon's latest effort to recalibrate its grocery strategy and revive momentum at Whole Foods, which it largely kept independent since buying the company for $13.7 billion in 2017. Amazon and Whole Foods have struggled to align on a unified growth strategy, leading to repeated reorganizations and strategic shifts over the years, BI previously reported.Under CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon has taken similar steps to more closely align other subsidiaries, such as One Medical and Audible, with its broader corporate culture.In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Lauren Snyder confirmed the changes, adding that the company has a \"successful and growing grocery business.\" Since the 2017 acquisition, Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and, with Amazon Fresh, generated \"tens of billions\" of dollars in sales last year, Snyder added.\"These changes reflect our long-term commitment to making grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable for customers,\" Snyder said.'Think and work differently'This is also Buechel's first major shake-up since stepping into his role as Amazon's grocery chief earlier this year. Buechel was named Whole Foods CEO in 2022 and was promoted to oversee all of Amazon's grocery business in January following the sudden departure of predecessor, Tony Hoggett.The new leader has work to do because Amazon remains a relatively minor player in the US grocery market. As of March, Amazon and Whole Foods had 1.4% and 1.6% of the market, respectively, well behind Walmart's 21.2% and Kroger's 8.6%, according to research firm Numerator. Amazon's share has even slipped from 1.6% in 2022.Amazon doesn't break out grocery sales. Instead, it reports sales from its \"physical stores\" segment, which has experienced single-digit growth in recent years. In the first quarter, Amazon posted $5.5 billion in revenue from physical store sales. Emarketer estimates Amazon's online grocery sales, excluding in-store sales, grew 10.1% last year, down from 20.6% the year before.\"One Grocery\"In the memo, Buechel said the changes are based on feedback he received during his first 100 days as Amazon's grocery leader. A \"unified employee experience,\" he said, can help drive faster growth as the previous team structure created friction, ranging from inconsistent tools and policies to incompatible technologies.As part of the transition, Amazon will review Whole Foods's employee compensation, benefits, levels, and titles. While employees will now adopt Amazon's compensation model, combining base salary with stock awards, their overall pay is expected to remain largely the same. Some roles and reporting structures may change, too, according to the memo.Amazon's grocery division recently implemented similar changes with its tech staff and was encouraged by the results, the memo added. Whole Foods employees are now urged to use their Amazon work emails to receive important announcements, though their Whole Foods accounts will remain active.Buechel described the broader initiative to streamline operations and enhance connectivity across teams at Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go as \"One Grocery.\"\"This next chapter in our journey will challenge us to think and work differently before we truly see the long-term benefits, and I know we will rise to the occasion,\" Buechel wrote.A mix of Amazon and Whole Foods leadersBuechel also introduced a new leadership team that brings together seasoned executives from Whole Foods and Amazon, including:Anand Varadarajan, VP of product and technology, who will lead Worldwide Grocery Technology and Supply ChainBill Jordan, EVP of Operations, who will lead Worldwide Grocery Store OperationsChristina Minardi, EVP of Growth and Development, who will lead Worldwide Grocery Real Estate Growth and DevelopmentGanesh Rao, VP of Amazon Fresh International, who will lead Amazon Fresh International and Grocery PartnershipsKaren Christensen, SVP of merchandising, who will lead North America Amazon Fresh and Amazon GoSonya Gafsi Oblisk, Whole Foods's chief merchandising and marketing officer, who will lead Worldwide Grocery Marketing & Private Brands and Whole Foods Market BusinessVishy Subramanian, VP of Amazon Grocery Logistics, who will lead Amazon Grocery LogisticsAstu Patel will be the Business Operations ManagerKim Wells will lead strategic retail initiativesTwo former Tesco executives who joined Amazon under Haggott — Claire Peters, VP of Amazon Fresh, and Peter Bowrey, VP of Fresh Operations — are absent from this new leadership list in the memo.Buechel added in the memo that new teams run by these leaders will \"define and refine\" the company's new structure over the next few months.Major changes in the pastAmazon's grocery business has undergone major changes in recent years. Last year, the company scaled back its Just Walk Out cashierless technology while rolling out a new mini-store format for Whole Foods. It also temporarily paused expansion of its Amazon Fresh stores in 2022 to reassess their financial viability, and wrote off $720 million tied to its Fresh and Go locations that year.Despite these changes, Jassy remains firmly committed to Amazon's grocery ambitions. During a recent Amazon shareholder meeting, he expressed optimism, saying he's \"very bullish\" on the sector. Whole Foods is \"growing meaningfully faster\" than the broader industry with a \"really good profitability trajectory,\" he added.Still, Whole Foods is looking to cut costs where possible. The internal memo, noted that the company has not committed to maintaining employee discounts.\"Nothing changes today,\" the memo said. \"If there are any modifications to the discount program as we work through this transition, we will communicate that along with details on other benefits.\"Have a tip?

The chief security officer for Amazon and AWS, Steve Schmidt, told Bloomberg News Tuesday (June 10) that government involvement in artificial intelligence (AI) could limit the scope of the company’s work in that field. [contact-form-7] “The tension with regulation of any kind is that it tends to retard progress,” Schmidt said, per the report. “So the way we tend to focus on standards is to let the industry figure out what the right standards are, and that will be driven by our customers.” Schmidt’s comments came at a time when the parliamentarian of the U.S. Senate is set to consider whether a provision forbidding states from enforcing new AI rules can remain in President Donald Trump’s tax package, according to the report. Senate rules allow tax packages to include only language that is budgetary in nature, so the Senate has proposed language that would deny federal funding for broadband internet projects to states that enforce AI regulations, the report said. Earlier, Trump rescinded the Biden administration’s executive order on AI, per the report. Trump repealed Biden’s AI regulations on his first day in office, marking a policy shift that is lighter on regulations and guardrails and more pro-growth and pro-innovation, PYMNTS reported Jan. 22. Biden’s executive order would have required the federal government to vet the advanced AI models of major developers such as Amazon, OpenAI, Google and other tech giants. It also established chief AI officers in major federal agencies and set out frameworks that addressed ethical and security risks. The proposed 10-year freeze on state-level regulation of AI that is included in the tax and spending bill includes carveouts for state measures that “remove legal impediments” or “facilitate the deployment or operation” of AI systems, as well as laws that “streamline licensing, permitting, routing, zoning, procurement or reporting procedures,” PYMNTS reported May 21. It would also allow state laws that do not impose any substantive “design, performance, data-handling, documentation, civil liability, taxation, fee or other requirement” on AI systems. Tech industry leaders argue that a national framework is needed to avoid a patchwork of conflicting rules, while critics of preemption say Congress has failed to pass meaningful legislation on AI, leaving states to fill the gap.

        "description": "Myra Deshmukh is the founder of Leadership Lab.Courtesy of Myra DeshmukhMyra Deshmukh quit her job at Amazon in March to start her own business after 10 ½ years there.She tried to take advantage of her benefits before leaving so she didn't leave any money behind.Her key tips include maximizing your 401(k), using personal days, and managing your stock options.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Myra Deshmukh, the 38-year-old founder of Leadership Lab in Montclair, New Jersey. It has been edited for length and clarity.Before opening Leadership Lab, a leadership training and career coaching firm, this year, I worked for Amazon for 10 1/2 years.I started as the buying and merchandising manager of the apparel category at Diapers.com, an Amazon subsidiary, and by the time I left, I was the senior manager of learning and development programs for Amazon's grocery business.When you quit your job, you might consider the financial implications but not necessarily how you can maximize your benefits. It's easy to overlook them.Here are five things you should take advantage of before you leave your job, including some I did and some I wish I did.1. Your 401(k)If you're leaving to start your own business and you're not sure if you'll be with another employer within the same calendar year — and you have a 401(k) option with your current employer — max out that contribution for the year.To maximize the benefit, you might need to change your 401(k) contribution percentage depending on the time of year you're leaving and how much you're making.When I left in March, I bumped my contribution from 15% to 60%. I only bumped mine up so high because I had two months, January and February, to try to max it out.2. Paid vacation days and personal daysWhile it depends on how your company allocates your time off, at Amazon, we had vacation days and separate personal time off. In New Jersey, if you leave your company or your job, you can only get paid for your remaining vacation days — not your personal days.I had accrued several personal days but hadn't used them, so if I left without using them, I would've forfeited all of that money. I made a plan to use all of my personal days before giving notice.Make sure your state will allow you to get paid out. If not, consider that when you give your notice and use those days so you get paid for the time off you've accrued.3. Stock-based compensationIf you have any stock-based compensation from your employer, like me, those stocks typically vest in a holding account at a bank. In that holding account, the stock is technically yours once it vests, but you can't diversify, sell it, or invest it in anything else.To manage the stock, you'll need to move it into a brokerage account. You can transfer it within the same financial institution that holds your holding account, or use your own personal banking institution to move it into a brokerage account. Once it's in the brokerage account, you can manage it based on your financial strategy.Companies don't oppose moving it to a brokerage account, but you have to figure out what to do with it yourself. They don't always tell you that when you quit.There are also some financial benefits to moving it out of the holding account. I got a lower interest rate on my home mortgage by moving my stock to a brokerage account at a specific bank.4. Medical benefitsIt's important to use your medical benefits before you leave. You likely already contributed to your plan via your paycheck for the portion of the year you were employed. Before quitting, I made a plan to get on my husband's insurance plan through his employer, but I still wish I had maxed out my own medical benefits before quitting.With my vision insurance, I could've received a free pair of glasses, but I didn't get them. After I quit, I thought to myself, I should've bought my glasses before I left.For others, this might also include attending all of your doctor and dentist appointments or really anything covered by your existing insurance.Although I knew about these things, I didn't prioritize them, so I definitely left some money on the table.5. Transit benefitsAt my old job, we had transit benefits, where pre-tax dollars could be used for commuting. I took the bus or train daily and paid for those with my commuter benefits. If I ever had to pay to park, I could use them for that as well.I wish I had maxed those out and paid for a large MetroCard or transit pass in advance, but I'm not commuting regularly anymore, so I didn't think of it. If I had, I could still be using it now when I go into the city.Do you have a story to share about quitting a job?

As the multiple antitrust cases this year attest, Google’s place at the top of the digital advertising market is clear (if under threat). The same can be said of its demand-side platform, DV360, although it’s up to the government to determine how that fares. However, arguably, it is the battle for the number 2 spot in the DSP sector where market forces are moving at a more intense (and interesting) pace as Amazon and The Trade Desk duke it out.This is a member-exclusive article from Digiday.

Each week, PYMNTS Intelligence details the competition between Walmart and Amazon, two behemoths of commerce, jockeying for share of wallet and hundreds of millions of consumers. [contact-form-7] In recent reports, we’ve chronicled the growth in subscriptions used by consumers across both these firms, with more than 30% of consumers having a Walmart+ account. As detailed in Walmart’s SEC filings, the company has 1.6 million employees in the United States, pointing to an installed base of consumers and workers that represent a strong foundation with which to forge a financial services ecosystem. Walmart’s FinTech efforts are now a bit more than four years old. In partnership with the Walmart-backed OnePay, the retailer has been busy with a string of announcements that take aim at banks and neobanks alike, in a nod to traditional financial products delivered digitally. Walmart consumers already have some familiarity with money movement as part of the range of services tied to Walmart. Walmart Money Centers have been staples of check cashing and remittances. The retailer’s co-branded card with Capital One had $8.5 billion in loans at the time that Walmart exited that card pact last year. In the latest announcement, on Monday (June 9), OnePay said it is teaming with Synchrony to launch a credit card program. The OnePay app serves as a digital front door through which general propose and private-label cards (for Walmart purchases) will roll out beginning this fall. Synchrony, meanwhile, has long made a mark in private label cards. Single Point of Access OnePay’s own site details the offerings thus far accessible through the company’s digital wallet, both online and in store, as consumers add debit and credit cards, and redeem rewards. As for the digital wallets, PYMNTS Intelligence’s “How the World Does Digital” series has documented that mobile wallets are tied to 35% of online and 21% of in-store transactions; a majority of consumers also use digital banking apps. The synergies here come as the digital wallets serve as that gateway to a continuum of financial interactions. OnePay/Walmart said earlier this year that a partnership had been struck with buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm Klarna to offer installment loans at Walmart. The moves come at a time when BNPL has been among the most widely embraced payment modalities. PYMNTS has estimated that BNPL transactions have hit the $175 billion mark, garnering enthusiasm across all income levels. Walmart, too, has seen an influx of higher income shoppers, with this demographic growing its footprint at big box stores. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that the retailer continues to gain share among households earning over $100,000, which now account for 75% of Walmart’s share gains in the U.S. toward the end of the year. Coming into 2025, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster detailed that the FinTechs and other digital only players would have to gird for turbulence. “[OnePay], with Walmart, can use the connectivity they have with brands to disrupt the economics of how pure-play FinTechs make their money,” Webster wrote in January. “That can become the basis for a disruptive business model that doesn’t rely on investor checks to cover up shortfalls in positive unit economics. The sheer scale of their customer base and supplier relationships, and the ability to connect purchases with offers and financing, is unmatched by any except for one other retailer — Amazon … [OnePay] looks like it could be a winner, and highly disruptive.” The post Walmart Takes Aim at Banks With OnePay Expansion appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Amazon is investing at least $20 billion in Pennsylvania to expand its data center infrastructure. [contact-form-7] The new investment, announced Monday (June 9), is aimed at bolstering the tech giant’s artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing technologies. The so-called “innovation campuses” are slated for Salem Township, just west of Pittsburgh, and Falls Township, a Philadelphia suburb, with Amazon considering multiple other communities in the state. Amazon said the project will create at least 1,250 new jobs, while supporting thousands more along the Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center supply chain. These jobs include data center engineers and network specialists, engineering operations managers, security specialists and additional technical roles. “Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar investment in Pennsylvania reinforces our dedication to advancing AI innovation while creating lasting economic opportunities in the state,” David Zapolsky, Amazon’s chief global affairs and legal officer, said in the announcement. “By expanding our cloud computing infrastructure, we’re investing in Pennsylvania’s future through new jobs, workforce development programs, and community initiatives. We look forward to helping drive the next generation of technology innovation, while delivering meaningful benefits for Pennsylvania residents.” The announcement comes less than a week after Amazon revealed it was making a similar investment in North Carolina, with the company planning to spend $10 billion to bolster its AI and cloud technology, while creating 500 jobs. Efforts like these, PYMNTS wrote, underscore Amazon’s ambitions on the AI infrastructure front, as the company and its rival Walmart are leveraging AI to redefine shopping experiences, logistics and customer engagement. Walmart is embracing “agentic AI,” autonomous digital agents perform tasks on behalf of users, while Amazon has begun enhancing its warehouse and logistics network using robots which can understand and respond to natural language commands. “This is a bold step toward more adaptive automation and human-robot collaboration, promising increased efficiency and decreased operational friction,” PYMNTS wrote. In a separate report last month, PYMNT wrote that after years of competing, Amazon and Walmart now face the same challenge: changing consumer behavior. “Recent earnings reports have delivered a warning shot for both industry heavyweights,” that report said. “After years of riding the tailwinds of a pandemic-induced shift to digital shopping, both companies now face a slower-growth environment as consumer spending patterns evolve and tariffs threaten price increases on everything from furniture to clothing.” The post Amazon Announces $20 Billion Cloud/AI Project in Pennsylvania appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

I ride a Lyft bike to the office every day; it takes 21 minutes from my homeDavid Risher.Courtesy of LyftAs I bike to work, I count the number of times I see a Waymo or a Zoox in San Francisco to see how they're growing. On my way to the office, I pick up a second coffee.I go into the office four days a week. Three days in the office is the official policy, but I like going to work and bumping into people.The first meeting of my day is a stand-up meeting, which typically lasts about half an hour, with my chief of staff and my administrative assistant. We map out the day and plan ahead.I then meet with all of my direct reports for about three hours to discuss any issues facing the company or opportunities.Some days are more operational, and there are some days when most meetings are product review meetings, where we're discussing the next version of things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, or the driver earnings guarantee.My happy place is at the whiteboard with a team trying to figure out cool new innovations or customer-obsessed ideas. A lot of my job is getting people to say yes to things that might be slightly bolder than they're thinking.I typically have lunch in the officeI take a 20-minute lunch. Half the time, I eat alone and work on something, and the other half, I work or meet with staff and other employees. I think it may be terrifying when I sit down at the table and say to our team as the CEO, \"Can I join you?\"Every day, I go for a half-hour walk and get an iced matcha. Sometimes, I'll do a one-on-one with a team member as we walk because getting out of the office makes for a different conversation.Risher getting his afternoon matcha.Courtesy of LyftPart two of our stand-up meeting is held with my chief of staff around 5:30 p.m. I leave the office around 6:30 p.m. and walk. I'll take a call or listen to a podcast and bike home the rest of the way.I have a goal of living to 100, so I walk, bike, get good sleep, have good relationships, and do daily activities. I go to the gym or a dojo twice a week in the evenings and bicycle on the weekends to keep my body active.About every six weeks, I drive for LyftRisher driving for Lyft.Courtesy of LyftI drive to learn about what our riders are going through when they get in the car and why our customers choose us over the other guys. I always love it when they say, \"You guys are better; you have a better level of service.\" That's what we aim for, so that's amazing.I don't tell the rider who I am until the end. There was a time I picked up a Lyft employee on her way to work, and she recognized me, but most riders don't know until I tell them, and they'll go bananas.I have two daughters, but they're both older, and they live in ManhattanMy wife, Jennifer, and I live on the West Coast. Jennifer is an author and a speaker. She travels often, but we have dinner together when we're both home.She almost always cooks; I like cooking, but she's much better than I am. My job is to clean up the kitchen and leave it spotless.After dinner, we both get on email for another 45 minutes.

I ride a Lyft bike to the office every day; it takes 21 minutes from my homeDavid Risher.Courtesy of LyftAs I bike to work, I count the number of times I see a Waymo or a Zoox in San Francisco to see how they're growing. On my way to the office, I pick up a second coffee.I go into the office four days a week. Three days in the office is the official policy, but I like going to work and bumping into people.The first meeting of my day is a stand-up meeting, which typically lasts about half an hour, with my chief of staff and my administrative assistant. We map out the day and plan ahead.I then meet with all of my direct reports for about three hours to discuss any issues facing the company or opportunities.Some days are more operational, and there are some days when most meetings are product review meetings, where we're discussing the next version of things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, or the driver earnings guarantee.My happy place is at the whiteboard with a team trying to figure out cool new innovations or customer-obsessed ideas. A lot of my job is getting people to say yes to things that might be slightly bolder than they're thinking.I typically have lunch in the officeI take a 20-minute lunch. Half the time, I eat alone and work on something, and the other half, I work or meet with staff and other employees. I think it may be terrifying when I sit down at the table and say to our team as the CEO, \"Can I join you?\"Every day, I go for a half-hour walk and get an iced matcha. Sometimes, I'll do a one-on-one with a team member as we walk because getting out of the office makes for a different conversation.Risher getting his afternoon matcha.Courtesy of LyftPart two of our stand-up meeting is held with my chief of staff around 5:30 p.m. I leave the office around 6:30 p.m. and walk. I'll take a call or listen to a podcast and bike home the rest of the way.I have a goal of living to 100,",

[…] The post Drones Take Flight — From Prime Air to Poolside Prosecco appeared first on PYMNTS.com. If you thought the future of eCommerce delivery was all about electric vans and AI-powered routing, think again. The sky — quite literally — is the new frontier for last-mile logistics. Drones, once the stuff of sci-fi and military operations, are now delivering everything from chicken sandwiches to prescription drugs, and the global market is soaring. For senior executives across banking and FinTech, this isn’t just a tech curiosity; it’s a glimpse into the next wave of commerce, logistics and customer experience. [contact-form-7] A Market Ready for Takeoff The numbers are staggering. The global drone package delivery market, valued at $5 billion in 2024, is projected to reach $33.4 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate of 37.3%, according to ResearchandMarkets.com. What’s fueling this ascent? A potent mix of technological innovation, regulatory clarity and consumer demand for instant gratification. Drones bypass road traffic, cut delivery times, and offer a sustainable alternative to gas-guzzling vans, making them especially attractive for urban and remote deliveries. Amazon and the Drone Delivery Vanguard No conversation about drone delivery is complete without mentioning Amazon. After a brief pause to upgrade its drone fleet’s software — a move prompted by an altitude sensor issue in dusty environments — Amazon’s Prime Air resumed operations in Texas and Arizona this spring, CNBC reported. The company’s ambitions are sky-high: it aims to deliver 500 million packages annually by drone by decade’s end, a target that would have seemed fanciful just a few years ago. Amazon’s latest MK30 drone model is quieter, weather-resistant, and designed to address community concerns about noise. The company is also eyeing international expansion, with regulatory milestones paving the way for broader adoption. Not to be outdone, Alphabet’s Wing, Zipline, A2Z Drone Delivery, and Serve Robotics are pushing the envelope with hybrid drones, robot-drone integrations, and beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations. Why Now? Tech Advancements: AI, autonomous navigation, and advanced sensors enable drones to fly safely and efficiently, even in complex urban environments. Regulatory Progress: Aviation authorities are establishing clear guidelines, making it easier for companies to scale commercial drone operations. Sustainability: Electric drones reduce carbon footprints, aligning with corporate ESG goals. On-Demand Economy: Consumers expect faster, more flexible delivery options — and drones deliver, quite literally, on that promise. From Chicken Sandwiches to Poolside Champagne: The Bizarre Side of Drone Delivery Of course, no Weekender would be complete without a look at the weird and wonderful ways drones are being used to deliver not just packages, but pure delight (and sometimes bewilderment). Here are seven real-life examples: Poolside Bottle Service: At the Cosmopolitan Marquee Dayclub in Las Vegas, drones deliver bottles of champagne and spirits directly to VIP cabanas. Chicken Sandwiches: Chick-fil-A in Brandon, Florida, now offers drone delivery of its famous chicken sandwiches — no delivery fee required. Laundry Service: A Philadelphia dry cleaner has used drones to drop off freshly pressed shirts and suits, though wind remains a wrinkle. Burritos from the Sky: The “Burrito Bomber” project in California aimed to be the world’s first airborne Mexican food delivery service, parachuting burritos to hungry customers. Valentine’s Day Flowers: FlowerDeliveryExpress.com attempted to deliver bouquets by drone for Valentine’s Day, though the FAA swiftly grounded the idea. Prescription Drugs: San Francisco’s QuiQui startup promised prescription drug delivery by drone in under 15 seconds. Taxidermy Cat Drone: In the Netherlands, an artist turned his late pet cat into a drone, flying “Orvillecopter” over art festivals and fields to the delight (and horror) of onlookers. Bizarre Destinations? Drones Have Landed There, Too A drone proposal: A man delivered an engagement ring via drone to his fiancée — she said yes, but the drone nearly crashed the party. Rooftop deliveries in urban jungles: Some startups have tested drone drop-offs to high-rise balconies and office towers, bypassing ground-level chaos. Remote islands and disaster zones: Drones have delivered medical supplies to places unreachable by road or boat, proving their value in emergencies. The Sky’s the Limit For eCommerce, logistics, and financial services leaders, drone delivery is more than a novelty — it’s a disruptive force reshaping customer expectations, operational models, and the competitive landscape. As the technology matures and regulations catch up, expect the skies above your city to get a little busier — and your next online order to arrive with a gentle whir. Enjoy your weekend, and keep an eye on the sky. You never know what might be landing on your doorstep next.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreI use the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ machine to make coffee and espresso drinks, and it's on sale now.Jennifer Gonick/Business InsiderAs a lifelong coffee lover, there are few things I appreciate more than the perfect cup of coffee or shot of espresso. But I know better than anyone that at-home barista dreams and city living aren't exactly compatible, as my lack of kitchen space has forced me to suffer with some less-than-ideal coffee makers over the years. Thankfully, a family member put me out of my misery and gifted me the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+, which makes all of the café-quality coffee and espresso drinks I love without monopolizing my precious counter space. If you, too, are on the hunt for a cute and compact brewing setup, you can get the machine 23% off now on Amazon.Follow our WhatsApp channel for more deals and buying guidesThe Pop+ machine, which our kitchen editors found to be the Nespresso machine with the best value in our best Nespresso machine guide, brews five sizes of Nespresso pods, from single espresso shots to 12-ounce cups of coffee. With the help of Nespresso's Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, I've used the machine to make both hot and iced specialty drinks like cappuccinos, americanos, and lattes that I would normally be willing to pay for in a coffee shop. With only a 30-second preheat time, getting the perfect brew has never been easier.Despite being Nespresso's smallest machine, the Pop+ has plenty of fun and convenient features. I love that it can be paired with the Nespresso app to give me recipe ideas and remind me when to descale the machine. The height of the cup stand can be adjusted, which helps minimize splatters while I'm brewing into a smaller cup. The machine also has a convenient compartment that collects used pods as you go, so you can recycle a bunch at once. Plus, it's super cute and comes in eight fun colors, so you can match it to your kitchen.AmazonI've used lots of single-serve, drip, percolator, and French press machines in the past, and the Nespresso consistently makes the best coffee, is the most versatile, and is the easiest to use.

It's a pleasure to get up and make my morning latte,\" said one reviewer. \"Delicious coffee and I found myself not needing to add sweetener with the addition of the frothed milk. Very happy with my purchase.\"Unlike other machines that can be an eyesore, shoppers love having this one on their counter. \"We are moving soon, and I have themed my entire kitchen around this machine because I love the color,\" said another reviewer who purchased the machine in mint.

Headcount operating expense refers to employee salaries plus their stock-based compensation, the email noted.The update was shared earlier this year by a finance leader in Amazon's retail unit. This executive explained that any increase in the hiring budget will be \"scrutinized\" and require \"strong supporting reasons.\" Business Insider obtained copy of the email.The retail business is also shifting from managing \"opex targets versus headcount targets,\" according to the email. That likely means managers now have a strict predefined budget allocated to their teams, instead of specific headcount targets when hiring.These changes only apply to corporate employees in Amazon's retail business. They do not apply to staff working in Amazon warehouses and in the company's cloud division, Amazon Web Services.The retail organization includes everything from Amazon's online marketplace to its logistics arm and Fresh grocery business.In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Zoe Hoffman said this is the \"responsible way\" to grow a company of its size, and stressed that not growing the hiring budget in a given year is not the same as not hiring. Amazon continues to hire across the company, she added.\"Each of Amazon's many businesses has its own approach to hiring based on its individual needs,\" Hoffman added in a statement. \"However, across the company, we've historically considered both the number of people we need to hire and the associated costs — that is, Operating Expenses or OpEx — of those hiring decisions.\"The move underscores CEO Andy Jassy's relentless push for increased efficiency and higher profit margins.Since taking over in 2021, he's slashed jobs, revamped pay, trimmed management layers, and even reconsidered Amazon's product listing approach, all in the name of saving money and driving efficiency. Amazon reported record profit of $59 billion in 2024, nearly double its 2023 result.Holding the hiring budget steady could encourage Amazon retail managers to get smarter and more flexible with compensation expenses. HR professionals say budget-based planning offers tighter financial control than headcount targets. That can be useful in uncertain business environments.Staying within limitsThe email said Amazon retail CEO Doug Herrington inspected operating expenses \"very closely throughout the last two years.\" The retail organization also recently launched new financial reporting and analysis tools for tracking headcount and operating expenses.

The company doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022.Managing headcount instead of a hiring budget lets managers bring on high-cost talent without worrying much about salary, David Kryscynski, a human resources professor at Rutgers, told BI. But with a fixed labor budget, he said, managers are more likely to stay within financial limits, either by hiring less or opting for lower-cost candidates.This model also gives managers more staffing flexibility, said Shaun Pichler, a management professor at California State University, Fullerton. Without headcount targets, they can bring on cheaper contractors or temporary workers. And they're not pressured to spend the full budget, often resulting in leaner teams.\"Tech firms have more widely adopted OpEx targets post-pandemic for largely the same reasons — high labor costs, reduced revenues, and to give managers more flexibility,\" Pichler said.Amazon's retail arm remains laser-focused on cutting costs.

        "description": "Amazon is making an AI coding tool from startup Anysphere available to its employees.Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web ServicesThis post originally appeared in the BI Tech Memo newsletter.Sign up for the weekly BI Tech Memo newsletter here.It's getting clearer who the winners will be in key parts of the generative AI race, according to Elad Gil, a top startup investor.\"In coding, it seems like it's consolidated into 2 or 3 players,\" he said recently on my favorite AI podcast, \"No Priors.\"He highlighted Cursor, Codium (now called Qodo), Cognition AI (the startup behind Devin), and Microsoft's GitHub Copilot.A clear sign of progress in the tech industry is when a giant platform decides to use an outside service rather than its own product. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have thousands of engineers who can whip up new tech pretty well. So it's a major signal when these companies decide that, no, their home-grown stuff may not be enough.This is happening with Cursor, an AI coding tool from startup Anysphere. Amazon is working on making this available to its employees, according to a scoop this week from Business Insider's Eugene Kim.Amazon already has its own AI coding assistant, Q, and is developing a more advanced tool codenamed \"Kiro.\" So this is a notable move for a company that had warned employees about using third-party AI tools.Google has its own internal AI coding tools, too. And yet, CEO Sundar Pichai said this week he's been messing around with Cursor and a similar service called Replit, building a custom webpage for himself.Software engineering is evolving from a specialized skill into something that non-technical folks can try. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang likes to say that everyone is a programmer now.

Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have thousands of engineers who can whip up new tech pretty well. So it's a major signal when these companies decide that, no, their home-grown stuff may not be enough.This is happening with Cursor, an AI coding tool from startup Anysphere. Amazon is working on making this available to its employees, according to a scoop this week from Business Insider's Eugene Kim.Amazon already has its own AI coding assistant, Q, and is developing a more advanced tool codenamed \"Kiro.\" So this is a notable move for a company that had warned employees about using third-party AI tools.Google has its own internal AI coding tools, too. And yet, CEO Sundar Pichai said this week he's been messing around with Cursor and a similar service called Replit, building a custom webpage for himself.Software engineering is evolving from a specialized skill into something that non-technical folks can try.

        "description": "Amazon famously started as an online bookstore. In the three decades since, it has disrupted how people buy, read, and review books through steps like undercutting local bookstore prices, launching the Kindle, and buying the book-review platform Goodreads. Now, Amazon has announced new job cuts, including at its Kindle and Goodreads teams, Reuters reports. In total, the company is reportedly cutting fewer than 100 jobs across its book division. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off about 27,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy, according to CNBC. The online retailer claims its decision should streamline the impacted departments. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our business roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization,” an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters. Criticism over Goodreads stewardship Amazon bought Goodreads in 2013 and has since been accused by the publishing industry of neglecting the book tracker and having only bought it to prevent competition. Goodreads “hasn’t been all that well maintained, or updated, or kept up with,” Jane Friedman, a publishing industry consultant, told The Washington Post in 2023. “It does feel like Amazon bought it and then abandoned it.” The online retailer also has a review system and launched a “Your Books” feature in 2023 for customers to track all their digital and print titles and get reading suggestions (another option available on Goodreads). Fast Company has reached out to Amazon for comment on how many jobs were cut at Goodreads and whether the online retailer is reducing its investment in the book review platform. Some individuals also don’t use Goodreads because of its connection to Amazon, as noted by CBC last year. There are entire Reddit threads devoted to alternatives with comments like, “I am doing everything to avoid Jeff Bezos.” That’s a bit easier to do these days as far as trackers go. A number of alternatives to Goodreads have emerged over the years, such as The StoryGraph, Bookly, and BookWyrm.",

Retailers like Amazon and Walmart don’t just battle for consumer spend in brick-and-mortar or online. They battle everywhere, all the time. [contact-form-7] As shoppers shift habits faster than you can say “same-day delivery” and tech upends every aisle, the winners aren’t just reacting but are increasingly predicting what customers want before they even know it themselves. Both giants are doing just that. Amazon is doubling down on cashierless stores, innovative deliveries and voice-enabled shopping through Alexa. Walmart, not to be outdone, is rolling out artificial intelligence (AI)-powered inventory systems, revamping stores into fulfillment hubs and partnering with startups to keep its tech game tight. But the real wild card? Consumer behavior. Shoppers in 2025 have come to expect everything: speed, convenience, value and personalization. Miss on any one of those, and your rival scoops the sale, especially as macro pressures squeeze the margins. That’s why both Amazon and Walmart are pouring billions into infrastructure and innovation, reshaping supply chains and reimagining the very concept of “store.” Their most recent efforts fall into three overarching themes: AI-driven innovation and infrastructure expansion, evolving consumer engagement strategies and bold strategic market expansions. Read more: How Amazon and Walmart Are Rewiring Retail’s Future With Robotics AI-Driven Innovation and Infrastructure Expansion Amazon and Walmart are charting ambitious courses into the future, leveraging AI to redefine shopping experiences, logistics and customer engagement. Walmart is embracing “agentic AI,” a paradigm where autonomous digital agents perform tasks on behalf of users. According to Walmart U.S. Chief Technology Officer Hari Vasudev, the company is developing personal shopping agents capable of autonomously navigating shopping journeys, from product discovery to purchase completion. These agents, powered by Walmart’s proprietary large language models, aim to deliver hyper-personalized experiences, integrating with the retailer’s existing digital infrastructure. Amazon, for its part, is enhancing its warehouse and logistics network with robots that understand and respond to natural language commands. This is a bold step toward more adaptive automation and human-robot collaboration, promising increased efficiency and decreased operational friction. And Amazon’s recent announcement of a $10 billion investment in North Carolina underscores the scale of ambition. The development, designed to bolster Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) AI and cloud infrastructure, is expected to generate at least 500 high-skilled jobs and solidify the region as a burgeoning AI hub. Evolving Consumer Engagement Strategies While AI investments are transforming operations behind the scenes, the consumer-facing innovations are equally significant. Both Amazon and Walmart are responding to a noticeable shift in consumer behavior, marked by a slowdown in discretionary spending and a reallocation of household budgets toward essentials like housing, healthcare and services. To address these dynamics, Walmart is enhancing its digital tools to support customers utilizing Medicare Advantage benefits. New features in the Walmart app and website allow users to identify eligible over-the-counter, food and wellness products, track benefit balances, and streamline the shopping process. Meanwhile, Amazon is doubling down on consumer loyalty by enhancing its Prime offering while acknowledging the competitive relevance of Walmart+. Interestingly, a growing number of consumers now maintain memberships with both services. Walmart continues to lead in grocery and in-person convenience, while Amazon dominates in online discretionary retail and entertainment. Read more: Amazon and Walmart Turn Groceries, Health and Data Into Distinct Empires Strategic Market Expansion and Business Diversification Beyond consumer experiences and operational efficiencies, both companies are pushing aggressively into new markets and verticals. Amazon recently unveiled its ZeroOne initiative, a team dedicated to inventing entirely new product categories. This team isn’t merely iterating on existing offerings; it’s exploring white-space opportunities with the potential to redefine consumer behavior altogether. The initiative exemplifies Amazon’s long-standing ethos of market creation rather than competition. On the other side of the globe, Walmart’s Flipkart subsidiary secured approval from India’s central bank to operate as a non-bank finance company (NBFC). This license enables Flipkart to lend directly to consumers and sellers, offering installment plans, credit lines and other financial services. It’s a bold move that positions Walmart not just as a retailer in India, but as a FinTech powerhouse. Amazon also recently inked a licensing agreement with The New York Times to access its editorial content for training large language models and enhancing AI tools across customer-facing platforms. These moves illustrate a shift from AI as an internal enabler to AI as a strategic asset — central to value creation, market expansion and even competitive insulation.

        "description": "DOT is looking to expand the pool of potential advisers for a new panel to help upgrade U.S. transportation infrastructure. The post Trucking, rail, Amazon vie for seats on DOT advisory board appeared first on FreightWaves. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has received over 50 nominations for a 10-person advisory panel being set up at the U.S. Department of Transportation to help overhaul freight and passenger infrastructure, but apparently it wants more. DOT is extending the deadline for nominations, which were initially due on Monday. The new deadline is June 13. Included in the first wave of nominees are representatives from the country’s largest freight lobbies and biggest users of its transportation networks, including the American Trucking Associations (Dan Horvath Sr., VP of regulatory affairs and safety policy), the Association of American Railroads (Ian Jefferies, president and CEO), and the Transportation Intermediaries Association (Anne Reinke, president and CEO). To help shape policies and regulations to improve U.S. infrastructure from a D rating to a B – as estimated by the American Society of Civil Engineers – DOT said it wants to create a board with “balanced membership that appropriately represents the varied interests of transportation stakeholders,” including experts from aviation, logistics, infrastructure, construction, finance and legal affairs. Steve Armato, VP of Amazon Transportation Technology and Services, could help with that balance if selected, according to his nomination letter. It states, “With over two decades experience at Amazon, Steve has a passion for innovating on behalf of customers, particularly at the intersection of technology, science, and operations.” “Steve’s leadership has contributed to Amazon’s agility to re-optimize and re-route our network in the face of disruptions, and has fostered the environment that embraces deploying new technologies at scale to advance safety and efficiency.” While the department did not specifically mention labor, the Teamsters Union sees such representation as an important part of the panel’s mission. “We believe that it is essential that the committee’s roster of industry leaders and experts include labor voices with deep expertise in the transportation industry to best inform its work,” the union wrote in a letter supporting the nomination of Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien. “As the Committee considers its taskings, particularly relating to infrastructure modernization, new investments, and regulatory improvements, O’Brien will provide necessary perspectives from the workers who keep our transportation systems running across all modes of transportation in every corner of the nation.” DOT received nominees from several companies and organizations that specialize in building infrastructure, including Ryan Lindsey, VP of government relations for building supplier CRH Americas; J. Bruce Bugg, chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission; and Husein Cumber, senior adviser of Brightline Holdings. Cumber has managed several capital projects, including reconnecting a rail freight line at PortMiami and building an intermodal container transfer facility at Port Everglades, Florida. “My experience in both the freight and passenger rail industries, and working with federal, state, and local rail transportation stakeholders, will provide a unique perspective,” he told DOT. Others seeking a spot on the panel include: Jason Ambrosi, president, Air Line Pilots Association. Faye Malarkey Black, CEO, Regional Airline Association. Laura Chace, president and CEO, Intelligent Transportation Society of America. Catherine Chase, president, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. Tyler Duvall, co-founder and CEO, Cavnue LLC. Garrett Eucalitto, president, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Fred Ferguson, president and CEO, American Bus Association. Maria Lehman, former president, American Society of Civil Engineers. Brigham McCown, chair and founder, Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure. Patrick McKenna, president and CEO, Eno Center for Transportation. Jim Monkmeyer, president of transportation, DHL Supply Chain. John Samuelsen, international president, Transport Workers Union of America. David Seymour, chief operating officer, American Airlines. Mike Sinnett, senior vice president of product strategy, Boeing.

Wilson may have rocked Hollywood, but the news hasn't changed director Danny Boyle's opinions about a potential return to the franchise.\"That ship has sailed,\" Boyle told Business Insider, when asked if the recent news would make him reconsider directing a future Bond film.Boyle famously dropped out of the 25th James Bond movie in 2018 over creative differences with the franchise's then-shepherds Broccoli and Wilson.

Wilson may have rocked Hollywood, but the news hasn't changed director Danny Boyle's opinions about a potential return to the franchise.\"That ship has sailed,\" Boyle told Business Insider, when asked if the recent news would make him reconsider directing a future Bond film.Boyle famously dropped out of the 25th James Bond movie in 2018 over creative differences with the franchise's then-shepherds Broccoli and Wilson.

        "description": "Amazon’s revamped Alexa at center of Reddit’s legal fight with Anthropic. On the heels of an OpenAI controversy over deleted posts, Reddit sued Anthropic on Wednesday, accusing the AI company of \"intentionally\" training AI models on the \"personal data of Reddit users\"—including their deleted posts—\"without ever requesting their consent.\" Calling Anthropic two-faced for depicting itself as a \"white knight of the AI industry\" while allegedly lying about AI scraping, Reddit painted Anthropic as the worst among major AI players. While Anthropic rivals like OpenAI and Google paid Reddit to license data—and, crucially, agreed to \"Reddit’s licensing terms that protect Reddit and its users’ interests and privacy\" and require AI companies to respect Redditors' deletions—Anthropic wouldn't participate in licensing talks, Reddit alleged. \"Unlike its competitors, Anthropic has refused to agree to respect Reddit users’ basic privacy rights, including removing deleted posts from its systems,\" Reddit's complaint said.Read full article Comments",

Amazon said Wednesday (June 4) that its latest artificial intelligence (AI) projects are related to robots, last-mile delivery and supply chain optimization. [contact-form-7] The company highlighted these efforts in a Wednesday post on LinkedIn. In the case of robots, Amazon said its agentic AI team is developing an AI foundation model framework that will allow robots like the company’s Proteus to “understand natural language commands, reason about them, and act autonomously.” For last-mile delivery, Amazon announced an initiative called Wellspring that aims to “dramatically improve precision of deliveries and the driver experience through the use of generative AI.” The company also unveiled the latest AI foundation model powering its Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT), according to the post. “This model processes over 400 million items across 270 different time spans, fundamentally changing how the company forecasts and positions inventory in ways that benefit price, selection and convenience for customers,” the post said. CNBC reported Wednesday that the agentic AI team working on the AI foundation model framework for robots is a new group within Amazon’s Lab126 hardware research-and-development unit, which created the Kindle, Echo and other devices. Reuters reported Wednesday that Amazon is using generative AI to create more advanced maps that help its drivers make deliveries in challenging locations like large office complexes, apartment complexes and housing developments. The firm also plans to use AI to predict customer demand for products based on price, convenience, weather and sales, thereby helping Amazon more efficiently cater to its customers, according to the Reuters report. These reports follow some other recent announcements of AI-powered solutions from Amazon. On March 31, the company launched an AI agent that can use a web browser to do things like shop for products and services on behalf of users. Call Nova Act, the AI agent can navigate, interact with and act on web content without constant human oversight. In November, Amazon Web Services announced the Generative AI Partner Alliance, which is designed to give customers access to a network of systems experts and consulting firms to help them deploy generative AI solutions. Amazon Ads debuted two AI tools in October, saying they are designed to help advertisers expand their reach by creating “engaging content across media types.” The post Amazon Aims to Use AI to Help Robots Understand Natural Language Commands appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Amazon plans to invest $10 billion toward building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure, bringing a massive shot in the arm to a region where many textile and apparel jobs dried up a generation ago. Amazon said Wednesday that its investment in rural Richmond County should create at least 500 jobs and support thousands more through construction and data center supply chain providers, according to statements from the company and Gov. Josh Stein’s office. Stein called the investment one of the largest in state history. Data centers are already familiar to North Carolina’s landscape, including those operated by Apple. This project could transform Richmond County, which is on the South Carolina border and has a population of about 42,000. The Richmond County site is expected to employ engineers, network and security specialists and other technical roles, the company said. Amazon said it would provide support for universities, community colleges and other workforce training programs to help people enter data center and broadband expansion fields. “This investment will position North Carolina as a hub for cutting-edge technology, create hundreds of high-skilled jobs, and drive significant economic growth,” Amazon chief global affairs and legal officer David Zapolsky said. “We look forward to partnering with state and local leaders, local suppliers, and educational institutions to nurture the next generation of talent.” Richmond County commissioners approved an incentives package for Amazon on Tuesday. The company could receive annual cash grants for 20 years equal to portions of the real estate property tax and the property tax for vehicles and equipment at each data center contingent on job creation and monetary investment thresholds, The Richmond Observer reported. “This project will truly transform our community in ways that we cannot imagine,” Richmond County Manager Bryan Land said at Tuesday’s commissioners meeting. “With the announcement comes large-scale upgrades to our water system, Rockingham’s wastewater system and our fiber optic infrastructure throughout our county — all of which will come at a cost to our Richmond County taxpayers of zero.” Stein’s office, which called the project an “innovation campus,” said the data centers will contain servers, storage drives, networking equipment and other technology. “Artificial intelligence is changing the way we work and innovate, and I am pleased that North Carolina will stay at the forefront of all that’s ahead as we continue to attract top technology companies like Amazon,” Stein said. The governor attended a public announcement about the investment on Wednesday at an investment in Hamlet. The company said it has invested $12 billon in North Carolina since 2010 and supports 24,000 full- and part-time jobs.",

        "description": "Inside the historic Book Depository at Michigan Central, now home to Newlab’s innovation campus, Brittanie Dabney is quietly building a different kind of startup. Her company, EcoSphere Organics, doesn’t make apps or mobility tech. It makes biodegradable coasters out of banana peels. Dabney and her team collect food scraps from local restaurants like Alchemy and Johnny’s Speakeasy—coffee grounds, citrus rinds, and eggshells—and process them into small-batch products like compostable packaging and plant-based leather alternatives. Using dehydration and fermentation, Dabney aims to create materials that are both functional and regenerative. “I want the vision of our process and manufacturing to be sustainable,” Dabney says. “No harsh chemicals, not water-intensive.” A coaster made from grapefruit peels at Ecosphere Organics in their NewLab workspace. [Photo: Nick Hagen/Planet Detroit/courtesy Next City] EcoSphere is still in early development, operating with grant funding and limited access to production space. “Once we’re able to get warehouse space, then we’ll be able to take on more,” she says. The company is part of a growing movement in Michigan to look beyond composting. With 745,000 tons of food waste landfilled in Michigan every year, they’re exploring alternatives: upcycling, food rescue, apps, and decentralized infrastructure that can transform waste into something more useful. EPA data identifies more than 10,000 food service establishments across Michigan generating significant amounts of food waste, with an estimated total of over 167,000 tons per day. These range from school cafeterias and restaurants to correctional facilities and healthcare institutions, each with unique waste patterns and constraints. The most frequently listed facility type is full-service restaurants, which account for more than 5,000 sites in the data set. Other common sources include cafeterias, limited-service restaurants, and food service contractors. Wayne County alone accounts for the most food waste, with more than 177,0000 pounds of average daily waste across facilities, followed by Genesee, Kent, Macomb, and Oakland counties. This diversity underscores the need for flexible, localized strategies—technologies and programs that can intervene at grocery stores, restaurants, institutions, and beyond. The innovations emerging in Michigan represent promising steps, but broader adoption and investment will be necessary to meaningfully reduce food waste statewide. Flashfood app: Where retail tech meets waste reduction While startups like EcoSphere are experimenting with banana peels and coffee grounds, larger players are tackling food waste at the point of sale. In Michigan, one of the most visible interventions comes from Flashfood, a mobile app that lets shoppers buy groceries nearing their sell-by date at a discount—and from Meijer, the first U.S. retailer to partner with the platform. “Meijer was actually our first U.S. customer,” says Esther Cohn, a spokesperson for Canada-based Flashfood. “Michigan was a natural next step because we already had a strong user base and Meijer’s scale gave us a way to grow quickly.” The model is straightforward: store staff scan soon-to-expire items—meat, dairy, produce—into the app, offering them at steep discounts. Customers place orders on their phones and pick them up from coolers near the store entrance. The goal is to keep food out of landfills and into shopping carts. “From a grocer’s perspective, you’re making money back on items you used to throw away,” Cohn says. “You’re reducing shrink and avoiding disposal costs.” Shrink refers to inventory loss from damage and spoilage. As of late 2023, Meijer customers had diverted more than 10 million pounds of food waste from landfills using the app, according to the company’s corporate impact report​. The program began in 2021. Meijer also became the first U.S. retailer to accept SNAP/EBT payments through Flashfood, expanding access to lower-cost groceries. Flashfood users purchase items through the app and pick them up in the store.

Even at Meijer, implementation takes planning. “We’re looking at multiple tools to address food waste,” says Erik Petrovskis, Meijer’s director of environmental compliance and sustainability. “That includes reducing waste at the source, diverting what we can, and making sure as little as possible ends up in a landfill.” Volunteer-powered logistics: Food Rescue US in Michigan In a parking lot outside a Whole Foods store in Midtown Detroit, Janet Damian loads trays of bread, cut-up sweet potatoes, some pies, and pineapple into the back of her Ford Flex. This isn’t a city-run program. It’s one of more than 500 monthly rescues coordinated by Food Rescue US-Detroit, a tech-enabled nonprofit that redirects surplus food from stores and restaurants to food pantries, shelters, and fridges across Southeast Michigan. Elli Chivari, 22, and Jessica Awan, 19, bring carts with donated food from Food Rescue US to the WSU Food Pantry. [Photo: Nick Hagen/Planet Detroit/courtesy Next City] “We rescue any type of food—fresh, frozen, prepared, nonperishable,” says Darraugh Collins, who runs the organization’s Michigan operations. “Sometimes it’s a whole carload. Sometimes it’s just a few bags.” The model relies on a lightweight infrastructure: a mobile app, a flexible network of 80 to 100 active volunteers, and over 144 food donor partners, including Target, Whole Foods, Plum Market, and LinkedIn. In 2024, the Detroit program alone rescued about 700,000 pounds of food, delivering it to more than 147 recipient agencies—many of them in the city, even though most food comes from outside its limits. One of those volunteers is Janet Damian, a retired medical administrator who lives in Dearborn and picks up food weekly from Whole Foods and other locations. “We’re reducing food waste by distributing it to people who need it,” she says. “It’s satisfying because the need is real—and the appreciation is real.” Her favorite moment? Delivering 30 birthday cakes from Whole Foods to the Wayne State student pantry. “Their eyes lit up,” she says. “It was like a party. It doesn’t matter what you bring, they’re just happy someone’s thinking about them.” That joy is familiar to Kenya Maxey, who oversees the Wayne State pantry, which also includes a thrift shop. “We’ve seen over 6,700 students in the last 12 weeks,” she says. “The numbers started climbing in January.” Maxey said the donations from Food Rescue US make their limited budget stretch further, and offer students a moment of normalcy. “They get to shop like they’re in a grocery store,” she says. “And that helps them feel like themselves.” Despite its reach, the model has limits. “We’re at capacity with the volunteers we have,” Collins says. “We need more funding, more drivers and ideally some paid positions to help us coordinate. The need is only growing.” This story was originally published by nonprofit news organizations Planet Detroit and Next City through the MIT Environmental Solutions Journalism Fellowship, as part of a series investigating how Michigan’s food waste system contributes to climate change through landfill methane emissions.",

Echo surveyed 5,000 carriers and shippers on the freight market On Tuesday, Echo and FreightWaves co-hosted a webinar that featured Sean Burke, Echo chief commercial officer, and Jay Gustafson, Echo executive vice president of brokerage operations. The presentation discussed the results of a survey conducted at the end of last year, with more than 5,000 carriers and shippers participating, split about equally, on their expectations for 2025. While much has changed the past five months, the survey results are still very relevant, especially with the context provided by the webinar participants. Going into the year, shippers expected flattish pricing despite anticipated volume growth. Most shippers were not budgeting for major freight rate increases, and those that did expected rate increases to be modest. Only 9% of shippers surveyed expected rates to rise more than 5% while 30% of shippers expected rates to rise in the 1%-5% range. Meanwhile, 36% of shippers expected rates to remain the same and 25% expected a rate decrease. But, when asked about volume, shippers expected to move more than they did the prior year. Thirty percent of shippers surveyed expected their volumes to increase more than 5% while another 37% expected their volumes to increase in the 1%-5% range. At first blush, those volume expectations seem to be at odds with shippers’ pricing expectations since pricing and volume typically move in the same direction. The Echo executives interpreted that to mean that shippers were confident enough that there was sufficient capacity that even a meaningful increase in volume would not be enough to make freight rates very inflationary. Carriers expected rates to rise, while also expecting pricing to primarily be a function of demand. Eighty percent of carriers surveyed expect either economic conditions and/or demand fluctuations to be the most influential factor impacting truckload pricing this year. Only 20% expect a supply-side issue, such as driver availability, to be the biggest factor driving pricing this year. Forty-five percent of carriers expected contract rates to increase by more than 5% while 51% expected spot rates to rise by more than 5%. Carriers said access to well-paying freight is their biggest challenge. Since the survey was taken, freight volume surprised to the downside – the SONAR tender volume index is down 12% year over year. Tender volume for 2023, 2024 and 2025 are shown in pink, green and white, respectively. (Chart: SONAR) Carriers and shippers came into the year at odds on pricing. Surveys often contain wishful thinking, which may be true in this case as well. Only 9% of shippers expected freight rates to rise more than 5% this year. That compares to 45% of carriers who expected contract rates to increase by more than 5% and 51% of carriers who expected spot rates to rise by more than 5%. No distinction was made in the shippers’ survey between spot and contract rates. The latest SONAR data points, on the 1-year year-over-year change chart above, show dry van contract and spot rates down 2% (VCRPM1.USA) and up 2% (NTIL.USA), respectively, showing the year has unfolded closer to shippers’ expectations. Of course, the market conditions could improve for carriers in the second half. (Chart: SONAR) Carriers seemed relatively unconcerned with driver availability issues. If the survey were rerun today, carriers might express more concern over driver availability in light of the Trump administration’s new guidance to enforce stricter labor, CDL and English language requirements. In the survey, only 9% of carriers believed that driver availability would be the biggest factor impacting truckload pricing this year. On a separate question, only 7% of carriers rank “ability to hire drivers” as their biggest challenge while “driver pay” was listed as the biggest issue for only 6% of carriers. Reflecting lackluster freight demand, 51% of carriers surveyed by Echo say “access to well-paying freight” is the biggest challenge impacting their business. Supply chain volatility supports freight rates. According to the Echo executives, the lumpiness in demand we have seen as a result of tariffs and the likelihood of supply chain disruptions should lead to freight rate inflation. That makes sense to me because, more often, capacity/equipment will not be in the location where shippers need it. Logistics Managers’ Index data shows rising inventory levels and inventory costs from last year, which reflects tariff avoidance and the anticipation of supply chain disruption. (Chart: SONAR) Are carriers and shippers taking freight fraud seriously? The response to the question regarding digital tools surprised me. Just over half – 50.6% – of shippers who responded said they were not interested and not planning to implement carrier verification tools. The Echo executives attributed that to shippers’ reliance on 3PLs rather than a lack of awareness. The Stockout show (Image: FWTV) On Monday’s The Stockout show, I discussed a recent article on cybersecurity before spending most of the time discussing the freight market. In short, the freight market is showing signs in the direction of tightening, potentially setting up a bullish second half for carriers. The show is available via The Stockout YouTube channel.

        "description": "I got an up-close look at Amazon's autonomous robot, Proteus.Madeline StoneAmazon has invested heavily in robotics and automation for its fulfillment centers.Its robots include mobile units, robotic arms, and sortation systems.Business Insider got an inside look at how the robots are made in facilities outside Boston.Amazon is making big bets on robotics and automation.What started with its $775 million acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012 has grown to include a fleet of more than 750,000 robots and an operation that employs more than 16,000 people.\"We have really pioneered new work and allowed Amazon to be more productive and take care of our frontline employees by improving the safety bar,\" Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, said.I recently got to see the facilities in North Reading and Westborough, Massachusetts, where Amazon builds and tests its warehouse robots. It was a sprawling look at what modern manufacturing looks like in the US.Take a look inside:I started the day at the North Reading office. A lineup of Amazon's robots past and present greets visitors at the entrance.Madeline StoneThe green one at the front is Amazon's latest mobile drive unit, Proteus, which can sense objects and humans in its path and move around them. The robots get older the further along the line you go.The facility is huge, stretching 209,000 square feet. From my view on the mezzanine, I could see mobile drive units that had just been built on the assembly line.Madeline Stone / BIThe blue robots, called Hercules, move pods of items around a fenced area of a fulfillment center. Each Hercules robot can lift a pod that weighs up to 1,250 pounds. The green robots, called Proteus, do similar tasks but move autonomously.The North Reading facility was previously home to Kiva Robotics before Amazon acquired the company in 2012.Julie Mitchell, director of robotic sortation technology at Amazon Robotics, told me how the company approaches robot design.Madeline StoneShe said that Amazon works with teams in its fulfillment centers to understand which areas could be made more efficient with automation. Robots go through early alpha testing and then beta testing before they are ready for mass production.\"We work backwards from our customer needs and think about which systems will help enable better delivery and faster speeds to our customers,\" she said. \"We look to try to develop systems that will add value within one to two years in our fulfillment network.\"Looking to the left, I could also see other robots being tested.Madeline StoneOn the middle floor are Pegasus robots, which transport packages around sortation centers.The yellow robotic arm below is Robin, which uses suction to pick up packages.I got a closer look at the Pegasus robots as we made our way down to the manufacturing floor.Madeline StoneThey zoomed around the floor, testing out new software updates.The Pegasus robot is an evolution of the Hercules robot, using the same base but with a conveyor belt on top. The orange robots are older, from before Amazon rebranded its Prime services to blue.I also got my first up-close look at Proteus. The eyes indicate he's spotted me.I got an up-close look at Amazon's autonomous robot, Proteus.Madeline StoneProteus is designed to work alongside employees on a shipping dock. Those workers don't get specific training to work with robots.\"It was really important to us to make Proteus intuitive to understand so the human-robot interaction is seamless,\" Mitchell said. \"We used the eyes as a way to communicate.\"When we got down to the manufacturing floor, I saw this poster that had been signed by Jeff Bezos.Madeline StoneAmazon has now built more than 750,000 mobile robots, in addition to its robotic arms and sortation systems.Erica McClosky, director of manufacturing and technical operations at Amazon Robotics, leads teams that build and test robots before they are sent to fulfillment centers.Madeline StoneAbout 300 people work on the physical side of building and maintaining Amazon's robotic fleet. The majority of those employees are on the assembly line, while others receive and ship materials and test and repair robots.\"We're in a very controlled, stable environment here, so we're able to, for all of our new products, continuously look at how we optimize the entire flow,\" McClosky said.Here, workers put together subassemblies that will be incorporated into Proteus' design.Madeline StoneAmazon's manufacturing stations have built-in automation, too, including torque tools.\"If you're supposed to install, let's say, four fasteners, it'll make sure that you only store four fasteners and that it has the right rotation,\" McClosky said.Employees receive parts to be installed on the robots. The parts are scanned so that they can be traced as they travel through Amazon's ecosystem.Madeline Stone\"If there were ever to be a problem, we could trace back and understand what's happening,\" McClosky said.Amazon sources its robotic parts globally as well as from some local suppliers.I saw one assembly line building Hercules robots and another building Proteus. Lights above each station signal green when everything is in place and red when something is wrong.Madeline StoneThe North Reading facility has four assembly lines with 10 stations each. Employees at each station complete their assembly tasks in about seven and a half minutes, using a lift assist for heavy items.The last step of the assembly process for Hercules is putting the blue cover on top.Madeline StoneAmazon asked that I not take close-up photos of the robots without their covers on due to the sensitivity of the technology.The assembly process for Hercules takes about an hour from start to finish. When the robots are complete, they're picked up from the assembly line by this lift and placed onto the floor.Madeline StoneLift assists are in place in various parts of the manufacturing process so that workers don't strain to pick up heavy objects.After the robots come off the line, they take a few minutes to get their batteries charged.Madeline StoneThe robots' batteries get charged to about 80% capacity before they are sent out to fulfillment centers.They then line up to be tested in these blue-fenced structures. McClosky said Amazon's testing technology is one of the biggest and most helpful innovations it's rolled out in recent years.Madeline StoneShe said that Amazon used to test its robots by filling big pods with bricks and having them drive around the factory floor for hours.\"What used to take us hours for testing here on the production floor is now done in minutes,\" McClosky said. \"It's looking at environments that it would see in the fulfillment center, so under different loads, making sure that it is fully, fully functional.\"Proteus has its own diagnostic center where it calibrates its cameras and sensors to maintain \"clear vision,\" Mitchell said.Madeline StoneProteus uses AI to \"see\" the space it's navigating and decide whether it can safely navigate around an object or needs to stop moving forward.Hercules is the robot Amazon has made the most units of over the years.Madeline Stone\"It's kind of our workhorse in the fulfillment centers,\" McClosky said.After the robots have been charged and tested, they line up for \"robot graduation.\"Madeline StoneNo caps and gowns here — \"graduating\" just means they're ready to be put to use.The robots actually drive themselves to the loading dock and put themselves on an individual pallet.Madeline StoneSince Hercules can't detect humans the same way that Proteus can, this is a restricted area.They're now ready to be shipped out to fulfillment centers and be put to work.Madeline StoneThey'll be shipped using the loading docks seen in the background.Next up, I watched a robotic arm called Robin pick up packages from a conveyor belt. Robin works in conjunction with Pegasus, the mobile robot with a conveyor belt we saw earlier.Madeline StoneThe packages I saw Robin pick up were all Amazon-branded, but the robot also frequently encounters packaging from third-party brands using Amazon's fulfillment centers.\"We're constantly using AI to train Robin to see different package types, different surfaces, different types of materials that it has to grasp,\" Mitchell said. \"We can change the way we grasp it by changing which actuator we send down to pick up the package. That helps cover the gamut of different shapes.\"I also saw Proteus in action, practicing transporting carts around the floor.Madeline StoneUnlike Amazon's other robots, Proteus doesn't need to be kept in a fenced-off space away from people.This robotic arm, Cardinal, scans packages' labels, determines which cart to place them into, and tightly packs them in like Tetris.Madeline StoneCardinal works in conjunction with Proteus.\"When Cardinal finishes the stacking and creates a complete container, it will signal to Proteus to come and take that container and replenish that container,\" Mitchell said. \"The two robotic systems working together has created an end-to-end automated path from sorting to loading that container onto our trailers and our ship dock.\"It's a powerful machine.Madeline StoneI could feel the ground shake as Cardinal worked.After the tour wrapped up, we traveled to the other Amazon Robotics facility in the Boston area.Madeline StoneIt's located about 50 miles away, in Westborough, Massachusetts.Both this facility and the one in North Reading also have corporate offices and research and development labs located directly off the manufacturing floor.Madeline StoneAmazon views this as a competitive advantage in that it allows for a more direct feedback loop. McClosky said that engineers and manufacturing staff work \"shoulder to shoulder.\"This facility is even bigger than the one in North Reading. Looking out from the mezzanine, it felt like the factory floor stretched on forever.Madeline StoneIt covers about 350,000 square feet of space.Tye Brady, the chief technologist fo",

Amazon Fire Sticks are enabling “billions of dollars” worth of streaming piracy, according to a report today from Enders Analysis, a media, entertainment, and telecommunications research firm. Technologies from other media conglomerates, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, are also enabling what the report’s authors deem an “industrial scale of theft.\" The report, \"Video piracy: Big tech is clearly unwilling to address the problem,\" focuses on the European market but highlights the global growth of piracy of streaming services as they increasingly acquire rights to live programs, like sporting events. Per the BBC, the report points to the availability of multiple, simultaneous illegal streams for big events that draw tens of thousands of pirate viewers.Read full article Comments",

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reportedly continuing to add data centers after opening a cluster of them in Mexico earlier this year. The company is building new facilities in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, AWS CEO Matt Garman said, per a Friday (May 30) Bloomberg News report. As it works to increase its capacity to power artificial intelligence, AWS also aims to expand its stock of Nvidia’s latest semiconductor, the GB200, according to the report. “Demand is strong,” Garman said. PYMNTS reported in April that Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, said in a LinkedIn post that the company continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads.” At the time of that report, AWS had 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS in April that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. In January, AWS said it plans to invest at least $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” Roger Wehner, vice president of economic development at AWS, said at the time in a press release. The server market is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2028, according to a January report by IDC. The biggest builders of data centers include Amazon, Microsoft and Google Cloud as well as data center companies Digital Realty and Equinix. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI. It was reported May 21 that one of OpenAI’s future data centers secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments. The center, which is being constructed in the Texas community of Abilene, is slated for completion next year and is set to become the ChatGPT maker’s largest. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX.

        "description": "\"There's not yet a commercial reason only to go to the Moon with humans.\" Eighteen months after leaving his job as a vice president at Amazon to take over as Blue Origin's chief executive, Dave Limp has some thoughts on how commercial companies and government agencies like NASA should explore the Solar System together. Limp had no background in the space industry before taking the helm of Jeff Bezos' space company in December 2023. He started his career as a computer scientist at Apple, took a stint at a venture capital firm, and joined Amazon in 2010, where he managed development of consumer devices like Alexa, Kindle, and the Fire TV. \"I had no thoughts of ever running a space company,\" Limp said Thursday at a space conference in Washington, DC. \"I've done consumer electronics my whole life. Started at Apple and did a bunch of other things, and so when I decided to retire from Amazon, I was looking for something that I could give back a little bit, be a little bit more philanthropic in the sort of second half of my career. I didn't want to stop working, just wanted to do something different. And about that same time, Jeff was looking for a CEO.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIAmazon's \"Bend the Curve\" program removes \"unproductive\" listings from its online marketplace.The initiative aims to clean up inactive or poor-selling items, while still growing product selection.These moves help control cloud costs for Amazon's retail business.Call it an \"Everything Store,\" just without the clutter.Amazon has been getting rid of billions of product listings deemed \"unproductive\" through a confidential project called \"Bend the Curve,\" according to an internal planning document obtained by Business Insider.The document reveals that Amazon planned to remove at least 24 billion ASINs, or unique product listings, from its marketplace. These underperforming items range from poor-selling items to those with misleading descriptions or inactive pages.\"Reduce active ASINs in the Amazon Catalog to be less than 50B (projected to be 74B by EOY 2024) by cleaning up unproductive selection,\" the document stated, giving a deadline of December 2024.Bend the Curve is part of a broader cost-cutting strategy led by CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm in 2021. Eliminating billions of product listings helps Amazon's retail business control cloud costs as it doesn't have to host as many product pages online.Amazon CEO Andy JassyREUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe initiative is notable for Amazon, which has spent 3 decades relentlessly expanding its product catalog in pursuit of a limitless online marketplace — a strategy that earned it the nickname \"The Everything Store.\"Amazon is still growing its vast selection, but the company is putting more focus on removing low-performing or inaccurate listings in favor of a more streamlined and effective catalog.Striking a tricky balanceHaving almost infinite selection means shoppers are more likely to find what they're looking for on Amazon, increasing the chances they buy something, and return again. That's been a powerful advantage over physical retail stores, which can only stock so much.Amazon is highly unlikely to give up the benefits of this massive product selection. However, some of the company's digital aisles have become cluttered and outdated in recent years, which could confuse or frustrate shoppers.Striking a balance between these two goals could be tricky, and Bend the Curve has been hotly debated internally, according to a person familiar with the project.Some Amazon shoppers may already be noticing. According to Evercore ISI's annual online retail survey, fewer respondents believe Amazon offers the best product selection.In 2022, a record-high 84% of respondents gave Amazon top marks for selection. That figure fell to 79% in 2023, and declined further to 68% last year, marking a record low in the survey's 12-year history.\"Phasing out items\"In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said the company will continue to expand its active product listings. The initiative is intended to clean up data, not curtail selection, the spokesperson said, adding Amazon added millions of new items to its product catalog last year.\"We have a cost-reduction initiative in place to remove unhelpful data, including product listings that are inaccurate, incomplete, or in other ways fail to meet our listing requirements,\" the spokesperson told BI. \"The aim is not to reduce active product listings.\"The number of \"active ASINs\" does not correspond exactly with the actual product selection visible to customers, and reducing that number doesn't always equate to a reduction in selection. \"Unproductive selection\" includes items that can't be purchased, for instance, if there's no actual inventory to support a listing, or if product listings haven't been updated for more than two years, the spokesperson explained.\"Our teams regularly review product listings based on performance, quality, and evolving customer needs — and we've done this for many years,\" the spokesperson added. \"In some cases, it may involve phasing out items that no longer meet our standards or are being replaced by newer versions. The goal is always to refine, not restrict, selection, ensuring our shopping experience meets the highest standards.\"The spokesperson added that there was \"no debate in the sense of whether to proceed\" with the Bend the Curve project.\"Leadership made clear throughout the process that the work should not, even by accident, negatively impact selling partners or remove selection from Amazon, and we put guardrails in place to ensure that didn't happen,\" the spokesperson added.'Throttling' listingsFor years, Amazon has simplified the process of becoming a seller on its platform. These third-party merchants are now responsible for more than 60% of all products sold on Amazon.Amazon believes that growing the number of third-party sellers and expanding product selection fuel a flywheel: more choices lead to happier customers, attract more shoppers, and ultimately drive continued growth.In Amazon's 1999 shareholder letter, founder Jeff Bezos envisioned a place where people could \"come to find and discover anything and everything they might want to buy online.\"Jeff Bezos on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Fred Prouser/ReutersHowever, Amazon's drive to create a limitless aisle of products has come with challenges. The platform has faced issues with counterfeit goods, expired food items, and non-compliant products, leading to consumer complaints and regulatory scrutiny.Amazon has taken many steps to tackle counterfeit goods in the past. And with Bend the Curve, Amazon is putting other controlling measures in place.In 2024, Amazon launched a new \"creation throttling\" feature that blocks new product listings from some underperforming seller accounts, the internal document showed. The company targeted at least 12,000 active sellers with catalogs of more than 100,000 product listings and no sales in the previous 12 months as part of the program, according to the document.This enforcement prevented more than 110 million new listings from being created, while nearly 3,000 sellers got warning messages for being close to the throttling threshold.The document said some of the sellers exited enforcement by modifying their listings or increasing their sales. The initiative \"promoted significant catalog cleanup,\" it added.Bend the Curve also led to confusion among some sellers regarding the policy's scope. According to the document, only \"unproductive\" accounts were affected. However, some sellers with multiple accounts mistakenly believed that their entire accounts were being blocked from creating new listings.In response, Amazon is focusing this year on more clearly \"defining policy enforcement and communication\" to avoid misunderstandings, the document said. The company is also analyzing deleted listings to determine if there are identifiable patterns.'Cost avoidance'By removing or streamlining unproductive listings, Bend the Curve saved more than $22 million in AWS server costs in 2024, the document said. Amazon projected an additional $36 million in AWS server \"cost avoidance\" in 2025 as the initiative continues.Amazon's retail division expected to spend approximately $5.7 billion on AWS cloud infrastructure in 2025, a 27% increase from last year's $4.5 billion, according to another internal planning document obtained by BI. That's a slower growth rate compared to the previous year, when AWS server costs rose 36% from about $3.3 billion in 2023.Have a tip?

        "description": "The 24-page pitch deck for Amazon's demand-side platform is telling: it puts its off-Amazon’s ambitions in black and white. For years, Amazon’s advertising playbook was all about keeping advertisers in-house — using its data to target shoppers within its own ecosystem. Now, it’s shifting gears, urging advertisers to take that data on the road to reach those same people, or ones just like them, elsewhere. The shift isn’t exactly a surprise. Its ad chief has been signaling the suggested strategy for a while, and advertisers have been reading the tea leaves. Still, without something concrete, it’s been tough for marketers to plan around. That’s what makes the latest pitch deck for its demand-side platform so telling: it puts Amazon’s off-Amazon’s ambitions in black and white. This is a member-exclusive article from Digiday.

Amazon’s devices unit is reportedly building a new team that is focused on inventing “breakthrough” consumer products and creating “entirely new product categories.” The ZeroOne team is led by Microsoft veteran J Allard, who helped create that company’s Xbox; has members in Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California; and includes staffers who were previously with Amazon’s business units that developed Alexa voice assistant, Luna cloud gaming service and Halo sleep tracker, CNBC reported Thursday (May 29). In job postings, Amazon has said that the team’s projects include a new smart home product, according to the report. “You’ll be part of a team that embraces design thinking, rapid experimentation, and building to learn,” one job posting said, per the report. “If you’re excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk with you.” An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Allard is overseeing ZeroOne, but did not provide details on the group’s work, according to the report. This report came about two weeks after Amazon cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. That unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Zoox robotaxi and Alexa. An Amazon spokesperson told Reuters at the time: “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” In February, Panos Panay, head of Amazon’s devices and services division, told CNN that the company is preparing to release a “constellation” of devices powered by artificial intelligence. “You can imagine … a constellation of devices that has to come together to make it a better experience,” Panay said. CNN reported that Panay didn’t say what devices might be included in that group. It added that Amazon has started to add AI to some of its devices, including Ring security cameras, Eero Wi-Fi routers and Echo smart speakers. The company also offers smart glasses, smart rings and fitness trackers. The post Amazon Building Team Focused on Creating ‘Entirely New Product Categories’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The New York Times (NYT) Company has signed a multiyear, artificial intelligence-focused licensing agreement with Amazon. The new arrangement will bring NYT editorial content to a “variety of Amazon customer experiences,” the media company said in a news release Thursday (May 29). “This broadens the companies’ existing relationship and will bring additional value to Amazon customers and bring Times journalism to wider audiences,” the release said. The agreement will see Amazon license editorial content from the NYT, its NYT Cooking feature and The Athletic for AI-related uses, according to the release. “This will include real-time display of summaries and short excerpts of Times content within Amazon products and services, such as Alexa, and training Amazon’s proprietary foundation models,” the release said. “The collaboration will make The New York Times’s original content more accessible to customers across Amazon products and services, including direct links to Times products, and underscores the companies’ shared commitment to serving customers with global news and perspectives within Amazon’s AI products,” the release said. The partnership is happening as Amazon is rapidly incorporating AI to improve the shopping journey. “In a move that signals a future beyond visual browsing, the company recently began testing AI-generated audio summaries for products in its mobile app, a clear signal Amazon wants to reduce friction in product discovery, especially on mobile and voice-enabled platforms,” PYMNTS reported Wednesday (May 28). “This dovetails with the broader strategy of turning the shopping experience into a more passive, streamlined and personalized interaction, keeping users within its ecosystem.” Amazon is also investing in AI-enhanced developer tools through Amazon Q Developer, a move that suggests that innovations such as the audio summaries are the first steps in a greater internal transformation. “Still, not all AI-powered experiences are providing early wins for Amazon,” the report said. “The company’s deal with the automaker Stellantis to create software that the companies hoped would transform the in-car driving experience has reportedly fizzled.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Amazon shoppers may not yet be feeling the full sting of tariffs at checkout — but signs are emerging that prices are inching higher, with a sharper surge looming this summer. Data shared with Modern Retail shows a steady climb in prices across some Amazon categories as brands begin to price in the costs of new tariffs. According to Momentum Commerce, a retail consultancy that helps brands sell about $7 billion annually on Amazon and other online marketplaces, the average selling price of historically top-selling products — a consistent basket of 2024’s bestsellers — has climbed for 20 straight weeks. As of May 17, those average selling prices were up 2.7% year-over-year.This is a member-exclusive article from Modern Retail.

The intense rivalry between eCommerce titan Amazon and brick-and-mortar giant Walmart has long pitted the two companies against each other. Now, both retailers have a new challenge: Shoppers themselves. Recent earnings reports have delivered a warning shot for both industry heavyweights. After years of riding the tailwinds of a pandemic-induced shift to digital shopping, both companies now face a slower-growth environment as consumer spending patterns evolve and tariffs threaten price increases on everything from furniture to clothing. In the first three months of this year, Amazon and Walmart posted their weakest quarterly sales growth since before COVID-19 unfolded in 2020. Amazon’s year-over-year growth clocked in at 3.7%, while Walmart’s was slightly lower at 3.2%. These figures barely outpaced inflation and represent a stark decline from their average growth rates in earlier years. Since 2022, Amazon’s quarterly growth typically hovered around 10%, making its 3.7% particularly lackluster. Walmart’s growth, usually in the 5% range, also contracted to historic lows. A forthcoming report from PYMNTS Intelligence unpacks how a move by consumers to direct more dollars toward things other than stuff is challenging the two companies’ one-stop-shopping strategy. Walmart dominates in groceries and Amazon for discretionary purchases like clothes and electronics, but shoppers have other demands on their pocketbooks. As the report estimates the two industry giants’ share of U.S. consumer spending overall, it reveals that the pandemic-era tailwinds that fueled eCommerce have dissipated. In their place: A consumer focus on paying for services, experiences, healthcare and housing. The report, the latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “Whole Paycheck” series, is based on corporate earnings reports and national data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It shows that both Amazon and Walmart are now growing at or near the rate of inflation, suggesting that their actual unit sales are essentially flat. The boost in prior years from accelerated online shopping, stimulus-fueled demand and reduced competition from smaller retailers clobbered by the pandemic is gone. In its place is organic demand — and according to PYMNTS Intelligence data, it’s tepid. Retail Loses Ground When looking just at the retail sector, Amazon continues to hold an edge over Walmart. In the first three months of 2025, Amazon captured 8.6% of America’s total retail spending — its highest first-quarter share to date, up slightly from 8.4% a year earlier. Walmart held steady at 7.7% of total retail spending over the same period. But retail is just one part of consumer spending. People must also pay for housing and healthcare, along with vacations and experiences. When viewed through that broader lens of total consumer spending, a different picture emerges: Both Amazon and Walmart are losing ground in the battle to capture wallets. In Q1 2025, Amazon’s portion of total consumer spending declined to 3.3% from 3.4% a year earlier, while Walmart dropped to 2.6% from 2.8%. These drops aren’t attributed to competitive weakness within the retail sector but to structural shifts in how consumers are allocating their dollars. As spending migrates away from goods and toward services, experiences, healthcare and housing, retail — especially mass retail — is losing wallet share in the broader economy. This trend isn’t just a recent-quarter anomaly; both companies have shown a gradual erosion or modest long-term decline in their share of total consumer spending since 2021. Discretion in Discretionary Spending Perhaps one of the most intriguing developments is the subtle shift occurring within discretionary spending categories, which include items like electronics, clothing, furniture, sports, music and hobbies. This segment has historically been an Amazon stronghold. In Q1 2025, Amazon saw a typical post-holiday dip in its discretionary share, falling to 23% from 26% in Q4 20248. While seasonal, this level represents one of Amazon’s lower Q1 discretionary shares since 2022. In stark contrast, Walmart’s share of discretionary spending jumped to 6.4% in Q1 2025, marking its strongest seasonal performance in two years. Notably, this increase was larger than the bump Walmart experienced a year earlier. While it remains to be seen if this is a temporary seasonal effect or a more fundamental shift in consumer preference, the uptick contrasts with Walmart’s past performance in this area and suggests potential momentum. Walmart’s historical focus on price leadership, coupled with its expanded eCommerce efforts, may be starting to resonate in higher-margin categories long dominated by its online rival. As inflation eases but wallet pressure intensifies due to the Trump administration’s global tariffs agenda, price and perceived value appear to be back in the driver’s seat for many consumers. For both companies, discretionary spending remains a critical battlefield. For Amazon, protecting its share in this profitable area will require renewed attention to pricing competitiveness, delivery costs and maintaining loyalty stickiness. For Walmart, this recent gain could represent its best shot yet at reshaping its position in these crucial higher-margin retail segments. Tariffs that raise sticker price could, of course, could be the spoiler.

        "description": "The Amazon/Stellantis STLA SmartCockpit was meant to arrive in 2024. Automaker Stellantis and retail and web services behemoth Amazon have decided to put an end to a collaboration on new in-car software. The partnership dates back to 2022, part of a wide-ranging agreement that also saw Stellantis pick Amazon Web Services as its cloud platform for new vehicles and Amazon sign on as the first customer for Ram's fully electric ProMaster EV van. A key aspect of the Amazon-Stellantis partnership was to be a software platform for new Stellantis vehicles called STLA SmartCockpit. Meant to debut last year, SmartCockpit was supposed to \"seamlessly integrate with customers’ digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences,\" using Alexa and other AI agents to provide better in-car entertainment but also navigation, vehicle maintenance, and in-car payments as well. But 2024 came and went without the launch of SmartCockpit, and now the joint work has wound down, according to Reuters, although not for any particular reason the news organization could discern. Rather, the companies said in a statement that they \"will allow each team to focus on solutions that provide value to our shared customers and better align with our evolving strategies.\"Read full article Comments",

And, […] The post Amazon and Walmart Turn Groceries, Health and Data Into Distinct Empires appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Walmart and Amazon are in a convergence war. What’s at stake is not just winning retail dollars but owning the infrastructure of daily living: shopping, healthcare, media and cloud services. Once merely competitors in eCommerce and brick-and-mortar, the two retail and tech behemoths now represent distinct philosophies in how to win the modern consumer. And, with consumer confidence finally on the rise, they may have a little more leash to run with when it comes to engaging with and winning over those consumers. From AI-powered experiences to healthcare integration and strategic real estate moves to navigating economic uncertainty, the strategies of Amazon and Walmart are converging while remaining distinct. Their maneuvers paint a picture of a future where retail is not just about transactions, but about ecosystems. Retail as an Intelligent Experience For its part, Amazon is leaning on its legacy of disruption and innovation by rapidly incorporating AI to enhance the shopping journey. In a move that signals a future beyond visual browsing, the company recently began testing AI-generated audio summaries for products in its mobile app, a clear signal Amazon wants to reduce friction in product discovery, especially on mobile and voice-enabled platforms. This dovetails with the broader strategy of turning the shopping experience into a more passive, streamlined and personalized interaction, keeping users within its ecosystem. Amazon is also investing heavily in AI-enhanced developer tools (e.g., through Amazon Q Developer), suggesting that innovations like the audio summaries are only the beginning of a larger internal transformation. Still, not all AI-powered experiences are providing early wins for Amazon. The company’s deal with the automaker Stellantis to create software that the companies hoped would transform the in-car driving experience has reportedly fizzled. Elsewhere, the integration of AI into traditional workflows has caused an alleged stir among Amazon’s software engineering teams. Read also: AI Takes Center Stage in Amazon-Walmart Memorial Day Showdown Membership Models Meet Consumer Pragmatism While Amazon innovates in digital experience, a notable consumer trend is reshaping how loyalty is measured. Increasingly, shoppers are subscribing to both Amazon Prime and Walmart+, not out of brand allegiance but practical need. Amazon remains the go-to for discretionary and digital-first purchases, while Walmart dominates on grocery and everyday essentials. According to PYMNTS Intelligence, dual memberships are becoming more common as consumers seek to maximize convenience and value. It underscores that no single retailer currently offers a fully integrated, best-in-class omnichannel experience. Each has strengths, and consumers are willing to pay for access to both. The realities of today’s consumer sentiment shifts are backed up by data in the May edition of the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Consumer Tariff Sentiment: Informed Americans Are Skeptical of the Benefits,” which found that more than 8 in 10 consumers said they were buying less, trading down or stretching out payments due to their concerns about the potential impact of tariffs. The retailers are adjusting in two main ways: Walmart is leveraging scale and supply chain efficiencies, but facing scrutiny for price hikes despite its value-first reputation; while Amazon is diversifying revenue through digital services and AI tools, potentially offsetting retail volatility. Walmart Embraces New Physical Retail Initiatives Walmart is aggressively expanding beyond its traditional domain. A key front in this evolution is healthcare. The company recently opened its largest centralized prescription fulfillment center in Frederick, Maryland. Capable of processing 100,000 prescriptions daily, this facility enables pharmacists in stores to spend more time on patient care rather than logistics. In tandem, Walmart is integrating Medicare Advantage benefits into its stores, allowing customers to use their supplemental health funds on wellness products. The aim to combine retail footprint, pharmacy logistics and insurance-based wellness programs represents a model that could rival traditional healthcare providers, especially in underserved areas. At the same time, Walmart’s recent $39.6 million purchase of the Bethel Park Shopping Center in Pittsburgh reinforces a shift toward asset ownership in key retail locations. The Battle Beyond Retail These developments signal a fork in retail strategy. For its own part, Walmart’s volume-based physical retail play is one that increasingly focuses on infrastructure and logistics (healthcare, fulfillment and real estate). On the other hand, Amazon’s experience- and tech-driven retail pushes automation, personalization and AI integration. Both roadmaps are about creating sticky environments that increase lifetime customer value, and the common thread from this week’s news alone is a shift toward diversified ecosystems — where traditional retail, healthcare, digital tools and logistics intersect.

        "description": "Opinion: Wider TV trends helped kill a show that was starting to live up to its promise. Late on Friday, Amazon announced that it was canceling its TV adaptation of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series, after several uncomfortable weeks of silence that followed the show’s third season finale. Fans of the series can take some cold comfort in the fact that it apparently wasn’t an easy decision to make. But as we speculated in our write-up of what ended up being the show’s series finale, an expensive show with a huge cast, tons of complicated costuming and effects, and extensive location shooting only makes mathematical sense if it’s a megahit, and The Wheel of Time was never a megahit. Adapting the unadaptable I was sad about the cancellation announcement because I believe this season was the one where the show found its footing, both as an adaptation of a complex book series and as a fun TV show in its own right. But I wasn't surprised by it. The only thing I found surprising was that it took this long to happen.Read full article Comments",

Amazon and Stellantis are reportedly winding down their deal that aimed to add the tech giant’s in-car technology to the automaker’s vehicles. The joint project, dubbed Stellantis SmartCockpit, was announced in 2022, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 28). The companies told Reuters that the decision to end their collaboration on the project was mutual. “Stellantis remains a valuable partner for Amazon, and the companies continue to work together on a range of initiatives,” they said in a statement, per the report. The SmartCockpit project aimed to transform the driving experience with sophisticated vehicle software that would detect the driver and personalize the thermostat, navigation and other settings, according to the report. Stellantis hoped the software would help it compete with companies like Tesla, while Amazon sought to expand its offerings to other automakers as well, the report said. The report did not cite a reason for the change but said that Stellantis faces the challenge of implementing software across 14 brands and that other traditional automakers have also struggled to add sophisticated software. The companies told Reuters that ending their partnership “will allow each team to focus on solutions that provide value to our shared customers and better align with our evolving strategies.” When Amazon and Stellantis announced their deal in January 2022, they said they would collaborate to implement Amazon’s technology and software know-how across Stellantis, including vehicle development, building connected in-vehicle experiences and training the next generation of automotive software engineers. Stellantis recently announced some other software-related projects. The automaker announced in February that it launched STLA Autodrive, an automated driving system that allows for automated driving at speeds of up to 37 mph. With this system, drivers will be notified that STLA Autodrive is available “when traffic and environmental conditions align.” Once activated, the system takes over, keeping at safe distances, adjusting speed, and managing steering and braking based on traffic flow. Also in February, Stellantis and Mistral AI expanded their partnership to include an artificial intelligence-powered in-car assistant as well as other AI-driven projects they have been working on together for a year. With the AI-powered in-car assistant, the companies aim to create a “real-time, voice-enabled user manual” that will answer questions about vehicle features, troubleshooting or warning indicators.

The announcement comes as Post employees are set to return to the office next week.In his memo, Murray outlined changes to its video and copy teams.On the video front, the company will place greater emphasis on \"repeatable franchises\" and \"personality-driven formats for YouTube,\" while also embedding producers within the newsroom.The Post will also restructure its copy teams to combine all editing operations into one desk.In a separate memo, deputy opinion editor Mary Duenwald wrote that the opinion section is still looking for a new top editor and will soon \"carry out in earnest\" a plan announced in February to focus on personal liberties and free markets.\"Ideally, our new editor will be known before the time is up\" to decide on taking a buyout, Duenwald wrote. She said the offer was \"meant to give people security to make a clear-eyed decision on whether they want to be part of the new direction for Post Opinion.\"The Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper sparked a backlash last year after opting not to endorse a candidate in the Presidential election for the first time in 40 years.In January, more than 400 staffers urged Bezos to meet with company leaders, saying that integrity and transparency issues had sparked high-level departures.In February, Bezos overhauled the opinion section and announced editor David Shipley would be stepping down. In March, Murray detailed further organizational changes, including new leadership roles and reorganized teams.A Post spokesperson said the company has been going through a serious and significant transformation in recent months, and called the voluntary buyouts an inflection point for employees to ask themselves if they want to stay or go.\"The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are,\" a spokesperson for the Post told BI in a statement.Here's Murray's memo:Dear All,Today, we are announcing that The Washington Post is offering a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) to news employees with 10 or more years' service at The Post, as well as to all members of the video department and to all members of the copy desk and sports copy desk.The program is part of our ongoing newsroom transformation efforts aimed at reshaping and modernizing the newsroom for the current environment. Like the rest of our industry, we are adapting to changing habits and new technologies that are transforming news experiences. Even as we have begun creating new departments and welcoming new colleagues, to reach new audiences we must increase our staffing flexibility and expand in areas such as audience data and social video.Our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. We are producing a more diverse news report with a great deal of superb and impactful journalism. I am confident we have exciting opportunities ahead of us. I also recognize, as I said at the all-staff meeting in March, that reimagining the newsroom, rethinking all we do and how we do it, is disruptive and even uncomfortable. The VSP presents an opportunity to colleagues who may want to pursue alternatives.In that light the VSP is being offered to the entirety of the video team and to the copy desks. In the former case, we are restructuring and refocusing our video team to place much greater emphasis on developing repeatable franchises and more personality-driven formats for YouTube, other social media channels and off-platform more broadly, while embedding some video producers and facilitators in the core newsroom to help all our journalists and artists produce more video for our products.On the editing front, we aim in the coming months to combine operations to one desk that will be part of the central news hub and ultimately will serve our digital products full time. The new print desk will also have a handful of crucial editing roles. These changes will enhance the speed and quality of our digital products and free most of us from constraints imposed by print requirements—while preserving the editing standards that undergird our focus on accuracy, clarity and credibility.I want to underscore that the VSP is voluntary, and that we are fortunate we can offer enhanced packages for those who choose them.Today's announcement kicks off an approximately two-month process that should culminate around the end of July. Eligible employees will receive a note with more details of the VSP later this morning from Wayne Connell. We will meet with the video team and editing desks later today and hold an information session for all others who are eligible. We also will schedule training and information sessions for managers in coming days.In coming weeks, we will name a print editor and welcome Jason Anders, the new ME for the news hub, and with them share more detailed plans on the new editing desks. And I expect to hold another all-staff in June to update everyone on our progress. In the meantime, please feel free to bring your questions to Wayne and Liz Seymour.With the VSP, we will no doubt see valued colleagues and friends decide to leave The Post. But as stewards of this great institution, we all must remain relentlessly focused on bringing engaging and relevant journalism to growing numbers of readers in the formats and ways they want it in 2025. That is an urgent and important task for us given the pace of technological change, the industry's evolving landscape and the ever-present need to produce and promote strong, rigorous and independent journalism.MattHere's Mary Duenwald's memo:Dear Dept of Opinions,It's been a few months since we learned about changes ahead for Post Opinion. We're closer to the time when the section will begin to carry out in earnest the plan laid out in February to devote attention to personal liberties and free markets. So it's important to begin to transition to this time of reimagining Post Opinion.Today, the company is announcing a voluntary separation program for Opinion. All eligible employees in our section will receive an email from Wayne Connell shortly laying out the details (contractors and freelancers will not).Please know that all of us will have time to make up our minds about whether to accept this offer. The decision period will run until the end of July. Ideally, our new editor will be known before the time is up.This voluntary offer is meant to give people security to make a clear-eyed decision on whether they want to be part of the new direction for Post Opinion.I'm happy to discuss this, of course. At 11:30 today, Wayne Connell will meet with us to answer questions. Mike, Mili, Chiqui, Alyssa, Trey and Bina are read in on this, and all are also willing to listen.MaryRead the original article on Business Insider The Washington Post's executive editor, Matt Murray, announced buyouts.Robert Miller/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe Washington Post is offering buyouts to staff as part of a reorganization.The buyouts will be offered to employees on the video, copy, and opinion desks.Read the memos executive editor Matt Murray and deputy opinion editor Mary Duenwald sent to staff.The Washington Post is offering buyouts to select teams as part of an ongoing restructuring.\"Like the rest of our industry, we are adapting to changing habits and new technologies,\" executive editor Matt Murray wrote in a memo to staff on Tuesday. \"To reach new audiences we must increase our staffing flexibility and expand in areas such as audience data and social video.\"The voluntary buyouts will be offered to news employees with a tenure of at least 10 years at the Post, as well as all members of the video department, copy desks, and opinion section.The time period to accept the buyouts will last roughly two months, ending in July.

        "description": "The UK is ramping up defense production, but may lack the skills base to keep up.Owen Humphreys - PA Images/PA Images via Getty ImagesLike much of the world, the UK is ramping up its defense spending.But defense companies are now competing with an expanding talent-hungry tech sector for scarce skills.\"We need a sea of talent,\" a defense sector insider told BI. \"At the moment, it's a puddle.\"When Calvin Bailey — a member of the UK parliament — was a squadron commander in the country's Royal Air Force, he saw a shift in how his engineering-heavy workforce changed careers.In the early 2010s, people would leave the service \"like for like,\" he told Business Insider — meaning they were leaving the military for complementary roles in the defense and aerospace industry.However, by around 2017, he said, a new sprawl of high-tech companies and major infrastructure projects created a demand for skills that the military had nurtured, such as robotics, advanced engineering, and logistics.Bailey wrote in a recent piece for War on the Rocks that he watched as the military \"hemorrhaged\" certified aircraft engineers.\"I found myself competing with unlikely adversaries: Amazon logistics hubs,\" he wrote.Calvin Bailey has been pushing to address a skills shortage in the UK defense sector.Nicola Tree/Getty ImagesAs the UK attempts to redress the effects of decades of reduced military spending, it's not just a steep price tag that has experts worried. It's a shrunken — and highly competitive — skills pipeline.Bailey still doesn't think the UK is spending enough, he told BI. But even if the country throws money at it, \"you haven't got the skills base with which to go and do the work that's required.\"A skills shortage in the defense industryPaul Oxley, a spokesperson for UK defense trade association ADS Group, told BI that demand for skilled workers now presents the defense industry's \"largest barrier for growth.\"This covers everything from traditional skills like welding and high-end engineering, to growing fields like cybersecurity, digital, and AI capabilities.Oxley said that surveys of ADS members have seen the issue of talent leapfrog energy prices to become the top worry for many companies.These concerns come amid an increased commitment by the UK to defense spending — to 2.5% of GDP — that has defense-related industries looking out for new orders.Big projects are already in the works. Dreadnought-class submarines, the Tempest fighter jet, and Type 26 and 31 frigates are due to come into service in the next decade or so.Yet in March, Kevin Craven, the head of ADS Group, warned lawmakers that skills shortages are \"combining to a point where both the defence and aerospace industry cannot fulfil the demand that they have.\"Workers at BAE Systems, a major UK defense contractor, in Barrow-In-Furness.Phil Noble/REUTERSThese warnings also come as the government prepares to publish its latest Defence Industrial Strategy, which a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said will help the UK have the \"capability, skills and industrial resilience\" for warfighting.Multiple skills initiatives are already underway, they added.An 'arms race' for skillsThe UK's defense sector pays an average of £39,900, Oxley said, which is about $53,000 and around 14% higher than the national average.But even that can't always compete with other sectors, Bailey, the MP, said.Meanwhile, many companies, like Amazon, actively recruit UK veterans as part of a government program pledging to support post-service careers. Amazon declined to comment when approached by BI.Engineers near construction of the Ambush submarine at BAE Systems in Barrow-in Furness.Owen Humphreys/PA Images via Getty ImagesBailey shared that other competing industries include infrastructure projects, such as the recent nationwide rollout of electric smart meters.He told BI those leaving the RAF for such companies \"would find an easier job — because it's less regulated and controlled and demanding on their skills — paying equal or more than they would expect on the general market.\"In addition, security clearances make it hard to hire from abroad — and in any case, the UK's nearest European defense industry neighbors are themselves in a scramble for talent.A shortage decades in the makingThe expansion of a talent-hungry tech sector compounds a much longer-running skills issue.Andrew Kinniburgh, a spokesperson for manufacturing industry trade body Make UK, told the Defence Select Committee in March that the country is in an \"arms race\" for engineers.Campaigners say STEM has been neglected from the earliest schooldays up, causing a shortage that has seen all sectors — not just military — competing for talent.That situation wasn't helped by the Apprenticeship Levy, a 2016 attempt to invigorate private sector investment in training. It was so cumbersome that schemes fell by 172,000 across all sectors in its first year, according to HR industry body CIPD.The government now says it's streamlining the process.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has inherited a problem dating back decades.Danny Lawson/PA Images via Getty ImagesThe looming threat of 'skill fade'Industry experts told BI that another reason defense sector workforce skills have atrophied is a long-term lack of investment in the military that began in the 1990s.The defense ministry spokesperson told BI that the current government is addressing the country's security \"after years of hollowing out.\"People like naval architects and high-level engineers take decades to nurture, and when orders dry up, \"you have skill fade in these areas quite quickly,\" said Sam Cranny-Evans, a freelance defense analyst and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\"Once they're gone, they're gone,\" he told BI. \"Standing them up again is really hard.\"COVID-19 lockdowns haven't helped. Suddenly, people with 10 to 15 years left in their careers decided to accelerate their retirement plans, leaving what Oxley called a \"handover cliff edge\" and a decadelong knowledge gap.The progress of the Astute-class sub — not pictured — was stymied in part by skills gaps.Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty ImagesThe problem has come to a head before.In the early 2000s, BAE Systems took over a contract to produce the Astute-class submarine, following a 10-year gap since the development of the earlier Vanguard-class sub.Dated skills — among other factors — became a major problem, forcing the UK to bring in General Dynamics Electric Boat, a US company, to help at an eventual cost of about $145 million.The project ran years late, exceeded its budget by hundreds of millions of pounds, and spurred multiple reckonings that still reverberate today.Janet Garner, BAE Systems' future workforce director for submarines, told BI the company is focused on ensuring it has a strong submarine workforce. She highlighted its $33.5-million training center and said early careers programs are \"up to record levels.\"An analysis by Navy Lookout highlighted lessons learned, saying that the next-generation Dreadnought went into production with a much more experienced workforce. But across the industry, there's a long road ahead.A 'puddle' of talentOxley and Bailey say there's a lot more to be done, and that skills need to be addressed at the level of education. Both are calling for schools and colleges to develop applied STEM curricula showcasing the appeal of working in defense.Encouraging a much more flexible career structure, allowing people to \"zig-zag\" between the military and civilian sectors and making the relationship complementary rather than competitive, is also among the suggestions being made.Tan Dhesi, a lawmaker heading up the UK parliament's Defence Select Committee, declined to comment in detail while the inquiries continue, but said that he had seen \"clear and consistent\" evidence that the issue needs addressing.\"We need a sea of talent,\" Oxley said. \"At the moment, it's a puddle.\"Read the original article on Business Insider The UK is ramping up defense production, but may lack the skills base to keep up.Owen Humphreys - PA Images/PA Images via Getty ImagesLike much of the world, the UK is ramping up its defense spending.But defense companies are now competing with an expanding talent-hungry tech sector for scarce skills.\"We need a sea of talent,\" a defense sector insider told BI. \"At the moment, it's a puddle.\"When Calvin Bailey — a member of the UK parliament — was a squadron commander in the country's Royal Air Force, he saw a shift in how his engineering-heavy workforce changed careers.In the early 2010s, people would leave the service \"like for like,\" he told Business Insider — meaning they were leaving the military for complementary roles in the defense and aerospace industry.However, by around 2017, he said, a new sprawl of high-tech companies and major infrastructure projects created a demand for skills that the military had nurtured, such as robotics, advanced engineering, and logistics.Bailey wrote in a recent piece for War on the Rocks that he watched as the military \"hemorrhaged\" certified aircraft engineers.\"I found myself competing with unlikely adversaries: Amazon logistics hubs,\" he wrote.Calvin Bailey has been pushing to address a skills shortage in the UK defense sector.Nicola Tree/Getty ImagesAs the UK attempts to redress the effects of decades of reduced military spending, it's not just a steep price tag that has experts worried. It's a shrunken — and highly competitive — skills pipeline.Bailey still doesn't think the UK is spending enough, he told BI. But even if the country throws money at it, \"you haven't got the skills base with which to go and do the work that's required.\"A skills shortage in the defense industryPaul Oxley, a spokesperson for UK defense trade association ADS Group, told BI that demand for skilled workers now presents the defense industry's \"largest barrier for growth.\"This covers everything from traditional sk",

        "description": "Amazon manufactures and tests its Hercules and Proteus robots inside a massive facility in North Reading, Massachusetts.Madeline Stone / BIBusiness Insider recently toured two facilities where Amazon designs and manufactures its robots.Amazon has hundreds of thousands of robots working in its sortation and fulfillment centers.Its facilities give an inside peek at what modern manufacturing looks like.Inside an unassuming office park in North Reading, Massachusetts, Amazon employees are hard at work building robots to support its vast network of fulfillment centers.This facility, along with another about 50 miles away in Westborough, provides a modern view of US manufacturing.President Donald Trump has made his pledge to bring manufacturing back to the US a cornerstone of his administration. But there appears to be a growing appetite for reshoring among company CEOs, a recent annual survey from consulting firm Kearney found. While tariffs and geopolitical tensions provide extra incentive to do so, some obstacles remain, the Kearney analysts wrote. People also aren't necessarily clamoring to work in factories. A poll by the Cato Institute done last year found that while a majority of Americans believed that the US would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, only a small percentage said they personally want to work on a factory floor.'A good attitude' and the 'ability to problem solve'The 209,000-square-foot facility in North Reading was previously the home of Kiva Systems before Amazon acquired the mobile robotics company for $775 million in 2012.Elevated platforms look down on an open floor area where robot models named Hercules and Proteus come off a manufacturing line. They have their batteries charged and systems tested, and then file themselves away to be shipped to fulfillment centers in a process Amazon calls a \"robot graduation.\" Both types of robots transport heavy pods of items around Amazon's fulfillment centers, but while Hercules follows a preordained path marked on the floor, Proteus can sense people and humans in its path and make its own decisions about where to go.There are four manufacturing lines in the facility, each with 10 stations. Lights above each station signal green when everything is in place and red when something is wrong.Workers build robots on four assembly lines inside Amazon's North Reading, Massachusetts, facility.Madeline StoneTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told Business Insider on a recent visit to the facilities that the company is proud of the fact that it manufactures its robots in Massachusetts.\"We know that it can be done and we can do that very efficiently and employ the local workforce,\" Brady said.A recent Morgan Stanley report estimated that Amazon's investments in robotics could save the company as much as $10 billion a year.Amazon Robotics's facility in Westborough is even larger than the one in North Reading, stretching about 350,000 square feet. In that facility, Amazon workers manufacture robots that can sort, like one called Sequoia that combines several different robotic processes into one storage system. Rows upon rows of cables hang down above containerized robotic storage systems that are testing software updates behind chain-link fences, safely away from human workers.Amazon manufactures sortation robots like Sequoia inside its Westborough facility.Madeline StoneBoth the North Reading and Westborough facilities also have corporate offices and research and development labs located directly off the manufacturing floor. Brady said the location is a \"competitive advantage\" because their engineers and manufacturing employees can work together from the start.\"And we've created many, many jobs because of that,\" he said.Erica McClosky, director of manufacturing and technical operations at Amazon Robotics, said that about 300 people work on the more physical tasks involved in building and maintaining a fleet of robots that's more than 750,000 strong.Erica McClosky leads manufacturing for Amazon Robotics.Madeline StoneThe majority of workers are assemblers who work on the line itself. Another team is responsible for testing robots before they go out to fulfillment centers and for repairing them when they're experiencing issues. There are also employees who receive and ship out the materials needed to assemble the robots. Amazon sources mechanical parts from local suppliers as well as global ones.These employees typically don't need advanced technical knowledge to do their jobs.\"Generally, the requirement for us is a good attitude, ability to problem solve, and be curious,\" McClosky said.In addition to those employees, about 150 engineers support and assist them. That includes process engineers who work alongside assemblers as they learn how to build a product, as well as test and quality engineers. Technical program managers bring the whole process together.'There's no doubt that we're seeing jobs change'Brady said Amazon's work is just the beginning of what's possible in \"physical AI,\" a term used to describe the process of bringing AI to robots that can perceive and react to the real world.\"When I speak about physical AI, it would be like us talking about the computer in the '50s,\" he said. \"I really foresee the future filled with physical AI systems that enable and augment a person's capability to do their job.\"He added that the team aims for the robots to be collaborative and always work in concert with humans.The work that happens in Amazon's Massachusetts facilities ultimately plays out in Amazon's sortation and fulfillment centers, where orders are picked, packed, and prepared for delivery. About 75% of the packages that Amazon processes touch at least one of its robotics systems.Julie Mitchell, director of robotic sortation technology at Amazon Robotics, said her design teams get direct feedback from operations teams at fulfillment centers so they know what tasks need to be automated and what may or may not be working. Mitchell and McClosky's overall goal is to optimize manufacturing and design so that robots arriving at a fulfillment center are ready to get to work.\"We partner really early on to get their feedback at the very beginning of our designs so that we're always going in the right direction with our technology,\" Mitchell said.The robot named Sequoia is a sortation and storage system.Madeline StoneAmazon recently opened a next-generation fulfillment center in Shreveport, Louisiana, with 10 times the number of robots than older fulfillment centers. Brady said that 30% more of the jobs in the Shreveport fulfillment center are more technical in nature than in other locations.\"There's no doubt that we're seeing jobs change,\" Brady said.But rather than have robots replace jobs, Brady said that Amazon is committing significant resources to upskilling its employees. That includes technical apprenticeship programs and paying for some employees' college tuition.\"You need both people and machines to work together in order to achieve this task,\" he said. \"If you can blend the best of both worlds — the common sense, the thinking at a higher level, the reasoning, understanding overall building flow, understanding the problems that need to get resolved — and then let the machines do the menial and mundane and repetitive, then you actually have created a more productive system.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Amazon manufactures and tests its Hercules and Proteus robots inside a massive facility in North Reading, Massachusetts.Madeline Stone / BIBusiness Insider recently toured two facilities where Amazon designs and manufactures its robots.Amazon has hundreds of thousands of robots working in its sortation and fulfillment centers.Its facilities give an inside peek at what modern manufacturing looks like.Inside an unassuming office park in North Reading, Massachusetts, Amazon employees are hard at work building robots to support its vast network of fulfillment centers.This facility, along with another about 50 miles away in Westborough, provides a modern view of US manufacturing.President Donald Trump has made his pledge to bring manufacturing back to the US a cornerstone of his administration.

In an era where retailers fiercely compete for consumer loyalty, a notable phenomenon is reshaping the landscape: the rise of the dual subscriber, holding memberships to both Amazon Prime and Walmart+. Far from being an either-or decision, a significant segment of the U.S. population, particularly millennials, is choosing to “win both carts” by leveraging the distinct advantages offered by these retail giants. This shift reflects evolving consumer priorities and spending patterns that payments executives must understand to navigate the future of retail and commerce, as PYMNTS Intelligence detailed in the report “Winning Both Carts: Millennials Drive Surge in Having Amazon Prime & Walmart+ Subscriptions.” The surge in dual subscriptions has been notable, as the survey of more than 2,000 consumers revealed, nearly doubling since 2021. The growth signifies a move toward multi-platform loyalty over exclusivity, driven by a desire to maximize perks and value in a post-pandemic economy marked by sticky inflation. Looking to Save Money The primary motivations behind subscribing to both Amazon Prime and Walmart+ are saving money and gaining access to exclusive perks and added services. These memberships offer lifestyle conveniences like free shipping and discretionary indulgences such as streaming access to movies and television shows. Consumers are increasingly choosing the best offerings from each retailer to meet their specific needs, rather than committing themselves to just one. This strategic approach allows them to compare prices and find the best deals, underscoring the perceived value of combined benefits, even among households facing tight budgets. Different Uses Across Different Platforms A key insight from recent analysis is the clear division in how dual subscribers utilize each platform. Walmart overwhelmingly dominates grocery buying, consistently being the default choice for food and beverages across all income groups and demographics. Nearly 3 in 10 U.S. consumers made their most recent grocery purchase at Walmart, compared to a mere 1.3% at Amazon. Even among Amazon Prime members, grocery purchases through Amazon are limited, with only 0.7% reporting their last grocery trip was there. Among dual subscribers, 44% last shopped for groceries at Walmart, versus just 4.1% through Amazon. Conversely, Amazon retains its stronghold in online discretionary retail. Dual subscribers, along with Prime-only members, continue to turn to Amazon for nonessential, higher-ticket items, reinforcing this divide. This pattern holds true across different income levels and generations. For dual subscribers, Walmart+ appears to function more as a complement to Amazon Prime rather than a direct substitute. Perhaps the most compelling finding for payments executives is that subscribers to both Amazon Prime and Walmart+ consistently outspend other consumer segments on retail purchases at Amazon. Dual subscribers averaged $110 per transaction on Amazon, significantly higher than Prime-only members ($78), Walmart+-only members ($75), and those with neither subscription ($58). This higher spending by dual subscribers persists year-round but spikes during major retail seasons like spring sales (March), back-to-school shopping (September), and the holidays (December), indicating a higher responsiveness to promotional cycles. Millennials are at the forefront of this trend, leading all generations in subscription adoption. A significant 37% of millennials hold both memberships, making them a critical audience driving much of the increased spending observed among dual subscribers. These consumers are not simply choosing sides but are leveraging the distinct strengths of Amazon (discretionary retail) and Walmart (grocery) to optimize their shopping habits and budgets.

Shoppers tired of doing online research on products they’re interested in buying could soon just listen to a robust CliffsNotes-type summary. Amazon started testing short-form audio product summaries, featuring artificial intelligence-powered shopping experts talking about a product’s key features, Amazon Vice President of Search and Conversational Shopping Rajiv Mehta wrote in a Wednesday (May 21) blog post. These AI assistants have done the product research, read the customer reviews and gathered other information on the web. They then voice the highlights of what they found to the shopper, per the post. These voice summaries make “product research fun and convenient — it’s like having helpful friends discuss potential purchases to make your shopping easier,” the post said. To access the voice summary, shoppers must tap the “Hear the highlights” button on the product’s page within the Amazon Shopping app, according to the post. Voice Commerce Gains Steam The first slate of products with voice summaries are those that usually need thoughtful consideration before buying. They are available to a group of customers in the United States, and a broader rollout is planned in the coming months, the post said. Amazon uses large language models to generate scripts for the audio summaries, as they pull together the product description, reviews and other online information, according to the post. Other Amazon AI assistants include Rufus, which answers questions for shoppers on its eCommerce site; Shopping Guides, which use generative AI to provide shopping guidance and product recommendations; Interests, which constantly monitors new products the shopper might like; review highlights, which synthesize product reviews; and Buy for Me, which uses AI agents to buy products from external brands’ websites. Using voice to make buying easier for consumers has received mixed reviews from retailers. In the fall, Taco Bell said it had handled 2 million customer orders using voice as it rolled out voice AI systems in more than 300 quick-service locations. However, McDonald’s had a different experience. It paused its drive-thru AI chatbot developed by IBM after two years of testing, following accuracy issues. Nevertheless, the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Getting to Know You: How AI Is Shaping the Future of Shopping” found that the use of voice for shopping is gaining traction globally, with 27% of consumers having used it for shopping or paying for retail purchases. Voice commerce is more popular among younger and wealthy shoppers, as 42% of Generation Z consumers and 31% of consumers earning more than $100,000 annually have used voice for shopping or payment.

        "description": "Freight-related layoffs hit Amazon, FedEx, UPS and F&S Produce West over the past week. The post Freight industry layoffs surge across California, Texas appeared first on FreightWaves. Layoffs continue to significantly impact the freight industry as firms in California and Texas announced more than 1,048 layoffs over the past week. Companies announcing worker reductions include UPS, FedEx, F&S Produce West LLC and Amazon. UPS UPS plans to cut two shifts at a warehouse in West Sacramento, California, eliminating 355 workers by mid-July. Atlanta-based UPS (NYSE: UPS) said the layoffs are part of a companywide initiative it described as “the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history,” according to The Sacramento Bee. In April, UPS told investors it planned to cut its workforce by around 20,000 positions and close 73 facilities by the end of the year. FedEx Supply Chain Logistics and Electronics FedEx Supply Chain Logistics and Electronics (NYSE: FDX) said it is laying off 305 employees at its North Fort Worth, Texas, logistics center, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notice filed with the state. The job reductions, which will be finalized by Oct. 25, were caused by a customer moving to another facility and contracting with a new third-party logistics provider, FedEx said. FedEx’s North Fort Worth logistics center will remain operational with 275 workers. F&S Produce West LLC F&S Produce West, a produce and food wholesaler, plans to cut 255 jobs from its facility in southeast Houston. The company did not provide a reason for the workforce reduction in its WARN notice filed with the state. It’s unclear if the facility will remain operational. Officials for F&S Produce West did not return a request for comment from FreightWaves. L&T Precision Specialty manufacturer L&T Precision plans to close a facility and lay off 81 employees in Poway, California, according to a WARN notice. The facility, which specializes in manufacturing services for the aerospace and defense industries, will shut down by Aug. 1. The company did not immediately return a request for comment from FreightWaves. Amazon Amazon is laying off 52 employees across four facilities in Sunnyvale, California, according to WARN filings. The layoffs include 33 employees from Amazon Lab126, an engineering and technology hub, as well as 19 employees from technology and fulfillment centers in the city. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) did not provide a reason for the job cuts.

        "description": "The CEO of Mercado Libre, the dominant e-commerce player in Latin America, has decided to turn control to one of his lieutenants and move to the board room. The post Mercado Libre, Amazon of South America, announces leadership transition appeared first on FreightWaves. The founder and CEO of Mercado Libre, an online marketplace often described as the Amazon of South America, has decided to call it quits after 26 years. In a letter to employees publicly released late Wednesday, Marcos Galperin said he will hand over his position to Ariel Szarfsztejn, the current president of commerce, on Jan. 1 and take on the role of executive chairman. Galperin said he will remain closely involved at Meli (NASDAQ: MELI), the company’s shorthand name, focusing on strategy, product development, culture, capital allocation, special projects and how to apply artificial intelligence to the business. Szarfsztejn joined Latin America’s dominant e-commerce platform in 2017 and led development of the company’s logistics network throughout the region. For the past three years he has led the consumer-facing marketplace. Previously, he held executive positions in the hotel industry, and also worked at The Boston Consulting Group and Goldman Sachs. “This is a generational change, and I know that Ari, along with the talented team that has supported me, has everything it needs to ensure Meli continues to grow strongly in the coming decades, continuing our mission to democratize e-commerce and financial services in the region,” Galperin wrote. “I’m proud to have created Meli, written its business plan in college, hired a formidable team – many of whom remain with me to this day – and, together with them and many others who joined, grown this company, achieved profitability, IPO’d on the Nasdaq, added millions of users, launched new products, adapted to technological changes, built and developed the largest technology team in Latin America, the largest e-commerce logistics network, became the company with the highest market valuation in the region, and, above all . . . helping hundreds of millions of people live better lives,” he said in the letter. Galperin said now is a good time for a leadership transition because Mercado Libre has a strong financial and market position. Mercado Libre’s net revenue in 2024 increased 38% year over year to $21 billion, contributing to operating income of $2.6 billion and margin of 12.7%. The total value of merchandise sold in 2024 reached $51.5 billion, up 15% YoY. The company said it surpassed 100 million annual unique buyers on the marketplace for the first time, with a 24% in buyers compared to 2023, demonstrating higher engagement and shopping frequency as a result of continuous investment in the user interface, assortment and logistics. Mercado Libre has the largest logistics infrastructure in Latin America, which has enabled it to offer fast-shipping throughout the region. During the year, Mercado Libre opened 10 new fulfillment centers, invested $500 million for capital expenditures in logistics and expanded its free shipping offering. It handled 1.8 billion items, with 49% of deliveries completed the same day or next day, which is considered a strong performance level for a region where transportation infrastructure is not fully developed. Seventy percent of orders are delivered within 48 hours. The increased scale of the logistics network has improved delivery efficiency, according to the company. While delivery speed is a priority, Mercado Libre is also making its network more flexible so it can offer slower, more economical, options. In a company podcast in March, CFO Martin de los Santos said Mercado Libre will continue to invest at a similar pace and expects to open several fulfillment centers in Brazil. The e-tailer will also add warehouses in Mexico, where its infrastructure is operating almost at full capacity, to keep up with the 30% year-over-year growth of gross merchandise value. The momentum continued in the first quarter, with sales up 37% to $5.9 billion versus the same period last year and operating income up 45% to $763 million. E-commerce represents 15% of total retail sales in Latin America, compared to about 16% in the United States. Third-party forecasts point to the market growing by 54%, from $151 billion in 2023, to $232 billion by 2028. With less than 5% share of the total retail market, Mercado Libre officials say they see plenty of runway to grow. Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.

Memorial Day may commemorate American sacrifice and the unofficial start of summer. But for Amazon and Walmart, it marks a critical moment in the retail calendar: a high-stakes, high-visibility opportunity to flex their respective strategic muscles. While both juggernauts share the goal of winning over consumers’ wallets, their tactics diverge sharply, shaped by their fundamental identities: one digital-first and algorithmically driven; the other grounded in physical presence and price leadership. Memorial Day isn’t Black Friday. It’s not Prime Day. But it is a telling moment. The holiday is a stress test for systems, a battleground for loyalty and a stage for strategy. Both companies, it appears from the news this week, are playing the long game. Amazon uses events like Memorial Day to reinforce its ecosystem and collect behavioral data. Walmart uses it to reinforce its community relevance and price leadership. As consumer expectations evolve, the question isn’t whether Amazon or Walmart will win. It’s how they’ll keep winning by staying true to what makes each of them essential. Walmart’s Digital Renaissance Once perceived as a brick-and-mortar behemoth, Walmart has undergone a significant transformation, embracing digital innovation to enhance its eCommerce capabilities. The company reported a 21% surge in U.S. eCommerce sales, attributing this growth to strategic investments in technology and a focus on customer-centric solutions. Central to Walmart’s digital strategy is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline operations and personalize the shopping experience. The retailer this week introduced generative AI tools designed to assist both shoppers and associates, aiming to simplify product searches and improve inventory management. These advancements not only enhance efficiency but also position Walmart as a formidable competitor in the digital marketplace. However, the company’s digital ambitions have not come without challenges. Walmart recently announced the elimination of certain roles within its technology and eCommerce fulfillment teams, a move aimed at optimizing operations and reallocating resources to high-growth areas. This restructuring reflects the company’s commitment to agility in a competitive environment. See also: How Amazon and Walmart Are Rewiring Retail’s Future With Robotics Amazon’s AI-Driven Ecosystem Amazon, a pioneer in eCommerce, has embedded AI across its vast ecosystem. The company has rolled out AI-powered search capabilities in its Amazon Music app, enabling users to discover content through natural language queries. This feature exemplifies Amazon’s broader strategy to create intuitive, AI-driven experiences that cater to evolving consumer preferences. Beyond consumer-facing applications, Amazon is empowering its independent sellers — who now account for 60% of sales on the platform — with GenAI tools. These tools assist sellers in creating compelling product listings, optimizing inventory and enhancing customer engagement. By democratizing access to advanced technologies, Amazon fosters a dynamic marketplace that benefits both sellers and consumers. In its pursuit of operational efficiency, Amazon has also made strategic adjustments, including the reduction of 100 jobs within its devices unit. This decision aligns with the company’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations and focus on areas with the highest potential for growth. Navigating Economic Headwinds At the same time, Walmart and Amazon are operating amid a complex economic landscape marked by inflation, shifting consumer sentiment and evolving trade policies. Walmart has acknowledged the impact of U.S. and foreign tariffs on its pricing strategy, leading to selective price increases in its aisles. Conversely, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has stated that tariffs have not significantly affected the company’s sales or average selling prices. This resilience may be attributed to Amazon’s diversified supply chain and its ability to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions. On the supply chain side, Amazon will have FedEx deliver large packages to the retailer’s customers for the first time in six years, following a January announcement by UPS that it will cut the number of packages it delivers for Amazon by half by the end of next year, according to the report. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reportedly dropped a lawsuit against Walmart and Branch that it filed in December. Ultimately, as Walmart and Amazon continue to innovate and adapt, the retail landscape is poised for further transformation. Walmart’s investments in AI and digital infrastructure signal a commitment to redefining the shopping experience, while Amazon’s integration of AI across its platform underscores its dedication to maintaining a competitive edge.

This week marked a captivating point in time for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), with technology leaders such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sharing his vision for the next generation of AI devices, Google CEO Sundar Pichai taking passive-aggressive potshots at AI rivals and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sharing his unwavering belief in AI’s benefits for the future. The following quotes from top executives offer a glimpse into how AI is being reimagined. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the announcement of the $6.4 billion acquisition of io, an AI devices startup founded by legendary Apple designer Jony Ive. “I think we have the opportunity here to completely reimagine what it means to use a computer.” At present, Altman said, for a user to to utilize ChatGPT, he or she has to turn on a computer, open a web browser, go to the ChatGPT website, type in a prompt and then wait for a response. Altman believes there is a better way. Io will become a division within OpenAI that will develop devices meant for the artificial general intelligence era. Jony Ive, former Apple chief design officer and a Steve Jobs protégé, after OpenAI agrees to acquire io and he agreed to lead creative initiatives at OpenAI. “Sam is a rare visionary.” Ive led the design of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch but left Apple in 2019. It is telling that he decided to partner with OpenAI instead of his former employer. While Apple and Ive have said they would work together on projects after he left, they ultimately did not. Ive’s design studio, LoveFrom, will remain an independent company. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai at this week’s Google I/O conference, taking potshots at rival AI companies that do single product drops on random weekdays. “I learned that today is the start of Gemini season. Not really sure what the big deal is. Every day is Gemini season here at Google.” “Normally, you wouldn’t have heard much from us in the weeks leading up to IO. That’s because we’d be saving our best models for this stage. But in our Gemini era, we’re just as likely to ship our most intelligent model on a random Tuesday in March or a really cool breakthrough, like Alpha Evolve just a week before.” At the conference, Google unveiled plans to integrate its AI capabilities into Search, in essence transforming it into its main AI assistant, powered by its most advanced AI model, Gemini 2.5. Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard, wrote on LinkedIn: “The Google I/O conference was a watershed moment for AI. The technology was present in almost every element of the company’s program — from smart glasses that use AI to provide language translation in real time to the evolution of Gemini into a universal assistant that uses agentic AI to accomplish complicated, multi-step tasks.” “But the most consequential for marketers is the rollout of Google’s ‘AI Mode.’ It’s a bold statement on the future of search, and if the industry leader is this committed, we should all be paying attention.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, reinforced his commitment to investing in AI infrastructure and products, according to Fortune. “We happen to believe that virtually every customer experience will be reinvented using AI.” Jassy refuted reports that Amazon was pausing data center development. Rather, the CEO said it was a matter of timing; Amazon wanted to better match customer demand with the opening of data centers.

        "description": "Amazon and Grubhub are entering the second year of a five-year commercial agreement that gives Amazon Prime members access to the food delivery platform’s subscription program at no extra cost. As part of the deal, Grubhub’s ordering tab was integrated directly into the Amazon app and website, allowing users to order burritos while shopping for face wash or streaming a show. That seamless experience appears to be paying off, say company executives. “Amazon Prime customers are a very engaged customer cohort,” says Jamil Ghani, Amazon’s worldwide vice president of Prime. More than nine out of 10 orders on Amazon.com or in the app are coming from Prime members returning to the order experience, the company says. Amazon plans to add food delivery through its Alexa+ service later this year, Ghani says. THIRD PARTY BOOST The collaboration arrives at a time when many companies are enhancing their subscription offerings. Amazon is competing with loyalty programs from Walmart and Target, hoping that added perks like Grubhub+ increase the appeal of its $139-a-year Prime membership. Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of this year, though it is one of the many retailers caught up in President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariffs. Shares of the company were up almost 11% from this time a year ago, though they’ve decreased 7.8% year to date. “The main benefit to Amazon of the Grubhub partnership is that it helps underscore the value of Prime outside all the benefits Amazon offers via its own services,” GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders tells Fast Company. “Grubhub is a very complimentary service as meal delivery and pickup is not something Amazon does itself.” Grubhub operates in the same competitive space as Uber Eats and DoorDash—both of which also have loyalty programs bolstered by third-party deals, with companies like Delta and Chase, respectively. Although Grubhub’s market share has declined steadily since 2021, integration with Amazon has introduced the platform to new users and increased awareness of Grubhub+. A Grubhub+ membership otherwise costs $120 a year and gives users $0 delivery fees and lower service fees. The companies claim that Prime members who use the service “save an average of $300 per year.” Amazon declined to share specific numbers on signups, but the company said there’s a more than 50% year-over-year increase in Grubhub+ signups since it integrated the platform “For Grubhub, the partnership expands the audience and the number or orders it fulfills,” Saunders says. “Amazon has a huge reach and Grubhub has been able to tap into this.”",

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told shareholders during a virtual meeting Wednesday (May 21) that the tariffs the President Donald Trump administration imposed on imported goods have not affected sales. “We also haven’t yet seen any meaningful average selling price increases,” Jassy said, according to a Wednesday Reuters report. “When you have 2 million sellers, they’re not all going to take the same action.” Some sellers have increased prices while others have kept prices the same, he said, per the report. Asked if Amazon was cutting back on its AI investments, Jassy said the company has “no plans to reduce our AI investment,” adding that reports citing the opposite are “not accurate,” GeekWire reported Wednesday. In late April, a Wells Fargo analyst said AWS was slowing down data center deployments, citing industry sources. Microsoft was also said to be slowing or pausing some early-stage projects. However, Amazon said the changes in data center deployments were a matter of timing the buildout to better match customer demand, not cutting back on overall investment, per the GeekWire report. Read also: The 2025 Certainty Project – Tariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play During the meeting, Amazon shareholders vetoed all eight of the shareholder proposals. The proposals ranged from separating the roles of chair and CEO to requesting a report on data usage in AI offerings. The shareholder proposals were the following: Mandatory policy separating the roles of CEO and chair. While Jassy serves as CEO and founder Jeff Bezos is the chair, there is no mandatory policy to separate the two roles. Bezos held both roles until he stepped down as CEO in 2021. Request for a report on Amazon’s advertising practices to monitor whether it avoids advertising on platforms that express political and religious viewpoints. Request for a report on climate-related risk disclosures at Amazon, including greenhouse gas emissions. Request for an additional report on how Amazon plans to meet climate change-related commitments it has made on greenhouse gas emissions, given the massive energy needs of AI and data centers. Request for a third-party assessment of Amazon’s board and its committee structure related to human rights risks in AI. Request for a report on packaging materials due to the growing plastic pollution in oceans. Request for a report on warehouse working conditions. Request for a report on data usage oversight in AI offerings. Shareholders also re-elected all 12 board nominees and approved Amazon’s executive compensation plan and the ratification of Ernst & Young as its independent auditor. Amazon will provide the full vote count in a securities filing. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Amazon signaled in an email to sellers that it has resumed a wholesale relationship with Nike, marking a potential reversal of Nike’s 2019 decision to stop selling directly on the platform. Amazon is signaling that it has resumed a wholesale relationship with Nike, marking a potential reversal of Nike’s 2019 decision to stop selling directly on the platform. On Tuesday, third-party merchants that sell Nike products on Amazon began receiving letters informing them that Amazon “will be working directly with Nike to source a number of their products moving forward.” The letter also said, “As part of this change, you will no longer be able to sell certain Nike products on Amazon in the U.S.” Sellers have until July 19, 2025 to sell through their existing inventory, according to the message. Modern Retail viewed a copy of the letter. Amazon did not specify how much of Nike’s catalog it would be sourcing directly, and some sellers posting the letter publicly on social media said that a limited number of products were impacted. Some pointed to predominantly apparel items as being affected. One Nike reseller posted on X (formerly Twitter), saying that 99% of his inventory is shoes sourced from Nike outlet stores, and only 23 out of 2,000 of his total Nike products on Amazon were impacted. Still, the move suggests a selective but significant thaw in Nike and Amazon’s relationship. Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

        "description": "Alleged members of an Armenian criminal enterprise were arrested Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $83 million worth of goods from Amazon. The post Armenian crime rings charged with attempted murder, $83M Amazon cargo theft appeared first on FreightWaves. Federal authorities on Tuesday arrested 13 alleged members of rival Armenian crime organizations locked in an apparent power struggle in Los Angeles County. The charges include attempted murder, kidnapping, illegal firearm possession, bank and wire fraud, and cargo theft totaling more than $80 million, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release. Among the defendants are Ara Artuni, 41, of Los Angeles, who is charged with attempted murder in aid of racketeering, and Robert Amiryan, 46, of Hollywood, who is charged with kidnapping. Authorities say both men were leaders of rival Armenian organized crime syndicates, referred to as “avtoritet,” which is Russian for “authority,” and that they have been engaged in a violent feud to maintain control of the San Fernando Valley since 2022. Artuni is charged with ordering the attempted murder of Amiryan during the summer of 2023. In retaliation, Amiryan allegedly conspired with members of his own criminal organization to kidnap and torture one of Artuni’s associates in June 2023. In addition to attempted murder, authorities say Artuni and his criminal enterprise committed bank fraud, wire fraud and cargo theft. Artuni and his organization allegedly targeted e-commerce giant Amazon by enrolling as carriers for the online retailer. Artuni and his men would contract trucking routes with Amazon, and while transporting the goods, diverge from the route and steal all or part of the shipments. The Artuni enterprise allegedly stole more than $83 million from Amazon, according to estimates provided by the company. “This transnational criminal organization operated with the structure and brutality of an international cartel, inflicting significant harm on public safety and causing substantial damage to legitimate commerce and supply chains,” Dwayne Angebrandts, Homeland Security Investigation’s Los Angeles acting deputy special agent in charge, said in a statement. Artuni’s organization also reportedly ran a “credit card bust-out” scheme in which it charged credit cards to a fake business and then “drained the business account” before credit card companies could collect the disputed funds. Several other arrests were made in the Los Angeles area and two more in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, Florida. Authorities continue to look for one defendant. Federal agents seized more than $100,000 in cash, 14 firearms and three armored vehicles in the May 20 operation, which included assistance from the Los Angles and Burbank police departments. If convicted of all charges, the defendants could face maximum sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison.

This as-told-to-essay is based on a conversation with Daliana Liu, a data scientist and career coach. Business Insider has verified Liu's employment with documents. It's been edited for length and clarity.After finishing my undergraduate math degree at a college in China, I moved to California to get my Master's in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. In January 2014, I started working at a startup, before being recruited by Amazon a little over a year later as a business intelligence engineer.I started at Amazon in Seattle, working on an A/B testing platform for their retail website. I created various statistical analyses and reports and supported product managers. I trained employees on how to use A/B testing to make better product decisions, eventually starting my own newsletter for Amazon employees to share experiment insights from across teams.An internal Amazon newsletter was my first content creation The newsletter was my initial content creation. I learned to create engaging titles and make my writing concise and interesting.During that time, I began writing on Medium about technical data science. Once, I wrote a viral post about saving money by picking the right month to start renting an apartment. It was exciting to help people make better decisions using data.I started posting to LinkedIn in 2019. I wanted to share the unfiltered truth about being a data scientist and getting a job at Amazon, after seeing misleading posts about the industry. A couple of my posts blew up, but the majority of my following was organic from posting regularly. I now have nearly 300,000 followers on LinkedIn.I then started a public newsletter. I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur and thought having public channels would help me find investors in the future.I moved up the ranks at Amazon and started a podcastIn December 2020, I moved to San Francisco to work for Amazon Web Services as a machine learning engineer. I got promoted to senior data scientist in 2021 and had to work with a lot of external customers. I read books about communication and influencing stakeholders. I wanted learn good communication for my own leadership within the company, as well as our clients. In 2021, I launched a podcast interviewing data scientists on their day-to-day work, how they tackle technical problems, and their career journeys. One of the guests I interviewed invited me to a dinner with his CEO, who offered me a job to work as a data scientist for his startup, Predibase. I quit Amazon in June 2022 to work at the startup.During the year I worked at Predibase, I continued to experiment with my podcast while also creating a career course for data scientists, teaching them essential communication and influencing skills.Between 2021 and 2023, when I posted weekly episodes, my podcast had 50,000 subscribers across platforms. My startup job supported me in pursuing a side business, and I started making income from sponsorship and events through the podcast. I started getting sponsorship in March 2023.I quit Big Tech to start my own business As much as I loved working in tech, I always wanted to do something of my own. Once I got to the point I had business contracts in place for my podcast, a plan for my course, and some savings, I decided to quit my job and start my own business in September 2023.Around the time I quit the startup, a VC firm tried to recruit me for a platform community growth role because they like my content and the podcast I built. I didn't take the job because I wanted to focus on my own business.I now have a career accelerator course teaching data scientists communication skills, how to get promoted, and how to build their brands.Being a thought leader opens job opportunties While working for Amazon and the startup, I had recruiters from top companies like Apple and Netflix getting in touch. Even after leaving Big Tech, I still get messages from people at companies like OpenAI and Meta trying to recruit me.They mention they like my experience in data science which they can see from my LinkedIn. They can also see my Medium blog and my podcast. I was able to get jobs through my podcast and recruiters often reference my content creation when they've reached out.It's very important in this job market to be a builder, and a great way to demonstrate that is to publish blog posts or create a demo for recruiters to stand out.I think Big Tech companies value my technical skills and industry thought leadership, which I post about on blogs and LinkedIn. Having a large following makes it easier for these recruiters to find and trust me.Startups and VC funds seem to value both my technical skills and content creation skills, also that I've built a community. By publishing my thoughts, I've opened myself up to data science roles, as well as developed transferable skills. If my path as a thought leader doesn't work out, I think it would be easy for me to find a job in data science, marketing, or a community role.I'm not tempted to return to tech or startups. There's uncertainty as an entrepreneur, but I get to choose my clients and projects. I can take time off and travel. I'm not married or a parent yet, but when that time comes, I want the freedom to be fully present.Read the original article on Business Insider Daliana Liu left Big Tech and startups to launch her own business.Daliana LiuDaliana Liu was a data scientist at Amazon and a startup before leaving to start her own business.She now works as a coach for data scientists looking to accelerate their careers and brand.Liu said she still gets cold DMs from recruiters at Meta and OpenAI because of her online presence. This as-told-to-essay is based on a conversation with Daliana Liu, a data scientist and career coach. Business Insider has verified Liu's employment with documents. It's been edited for length and clarity.After finishing my undergraduate math degree at a college in China, I moved to California to get my Master's in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. In January 2014, I started working at a startup, before being recruited by Amazon a little over a year later as a business intelligence engineer.I started at Amazon in Seattle, working on an A/B testing platform for their retail website. I created various statistical analyses and reports and supported product managers. I trained employees on how to use A/B testing to make better product decisions, eventually starting my own newsletter for Amazon employees to share experiment insights from across teams.An internal Amazon newsletter was my first content creation The newsletter was my initial content creation. I learned to create engaging titles and make my writing concise and interesting.During that time, I began writing on Medium about technical data science. Once, I wrote a viral post about saving money by picking the right month to start renting an apartment. It was exciting to help people make better decisions using data.I started posting to LinkedIn in 2019. I wanted to share the unfiltered truth about being a data scientist and getting a job at Amazon, after seeing misleading posts about the industry. A couple of my posts blew up, but the majority of my following was organic from posting regularly. I now have nearly 300,000 followers on LinkedIn.I then started a public newsletter. I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur and thought having public channels would help me find investors in the future.I moved up the ranks at Amazon and started a podcastIn December 2020, I moved to San Francisco to work for Amazon Web Services as a machine learning engineer. I got promoted to senior data scientist in 2021 and had to work with a lot of external customers. I read books about communication and influencing stakeholders. I wanted learn good communication for my own leadership within the company, as well as our clients. In 2021, I launched a podcast interviewing data scientists on their day-to-day work, how they tackle technical problems, and their career journeys. One of the guests I interviewed invited me to a dinner with his CEO, who offered me a job to work as a data scientist for his startup, Predibase. I quit Amazon in June 2022 to work at the startup.During the year I worked at Predibase, I continued to experiment with my podcast while also creating a career course for data scientists, teaching them essential communication and influencing skills.Between 2021 and 2023, when I posted weekly episodes, my podcast had 50,000 subscribers across platforms. My startup job supported me in pursuing a side business, and I started making income from sponsorship and events through the podcast. I started getting sponsorship in March 2023.I quit Big Tech to start my own business As much as I loved working in tech, I always wanted to do something of my own. Once I got to the point I had business contracts in place for my podcast, a plan for my course, and some savings, I decided to quit my job and start my own business in September 2023.Around the time I quit the startup, a VC firm tried to recruit me for a platform community growth role because they like my content and the podcast I built. I didn't take the job because I wanted to focus on my own business.I now have a career accelerator course teaching data scientists communication skills, how to get promoted, and how to build their brands.Being a thought leader opens job opportunties While working for Amazon and the startup, I had recruiters from top companies like Apple and Netflix getting in touch. Even after leaving Big Tech, I still get messages from people at companies like OpenAI and",

Independent sellers now account for 60% of the sales in Amazon’s store, the company said Tuesday (May 20). In 2024, these Amazon Selling Partners averaged over $290,000 in annual sales and employed more than 2 million people, Amazon said in a Tuesday press release outlining findings from its latest annual Small Business Empowerment Report. Compared to the previous year, the annual sales figure was up 16%, while the employment number was up 11%, according to the release. More than 55,000 independent sellers generated sales of over $1 million in 2024, per the release. “It’s a partnership that’s providing customers with amazing selection while creating opportunities for entrepreneurs across America,” Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services at Amazon, said in a video about the report. In the time since the company made its platform available to them in 2000, independent sellers have generated over $2.5 trillion in sales in Amazon’s store, according to the release. They have also exported more than 2 billion items globally. Since it launched Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) in 2006, these sellers have shipped more than 80 billion items through the program, per the release. “What began as a bold idea in 2000 has grown into one of the most powerful economic engines for small businesses in the world,” Mehta said in the video. Independent sellers are also adopting the artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies developed for them by Amazon, including generative AI-powered features for listing creation and optimization, customer loyalty and analytics, and supply chain optimization, the release said. “For example, our generative AI-powered product listing tools have been used by more than 900,000 independent sellers,” Mehta said in the video. “And we’re continuing to launch more and more new innovations.” Amazon debuted an AI-powered tool called Enhance My Listing on May 8, saying the tool helps its selling partners maintain and optimize product listings. In September, PYMNTS reported that independent sellers who were gathered for Amazon’s annual Accelerate conference said they were most interested in GenAI and logistics. They weren’t disappointed, as Amazon used the event to introduce a slew of AI applications, the ability of sellers using its warehouses to easily resell returned items, and a tool that helps sellers avoid returns by offering free product support.

Over the past year, the likes of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have sent out a flurry of announcements related to nuclear energy. Some are about agreements to purchase power from existing plants, while others are about investments looking to boost unproven advanced technologies. This story is a part of MIT Technology Review’s series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution. These somewhat unlikely partnerships could be a win for both the nuclear power industry and large tech companies. Tech giants need guaranteed sources of energy, and many are looking for low-emissions ones to hit their climate goals. For nuclear plant operators and nuclear technology developers, the financial support of massive established customers could help keep old nuclear power plants open and push new technologies forward. “There [are] a lot of advantages to nuclear,” says Michael Terrell, senior director of clean energy and carbon reduction at Google. Among them, he says, are that it’s “clean, firm, carbon-free, and can be sited just about anywhere.” (Firm energy sources are those that provide constant power.) But there’s one glaring potential roadblock: timing. “There are needs on different time scales,” says Patrick White, former research director at the Nuclear Innovation Alliance. Many of these tech companies will require large amounts of power in the next three to five years, White says, but building new nuclear plants can take close to a decade. Some next-generation nuclear technologies, especially small modular reactors, could take less time to build, but the companies promising speed have yet to build their first reactors—and in some cases they are still years away from even modestly sized demonstrations. This timing mismatch means that even as tech companies tout plans for nuclear power, they’ll actually be relying largely on fossil fuels, keeping coal plants open, and even building new natural gas plants that could stay open for decades. AI and nuclear could genuinely help each other grow, but the reality is that the growth could be much slower than headlines suggest. AI’s need for speed The US alone has roughly 3,000 data centers, and current projections say the AI boom could add thousands more by the end of the decade. The rush could increase global data center power demand by as much as 165% by 2030, according to one recent analysis from Goldman Sachs. In the US, estimates from industry and academia suggest energy demand for data centers could be as high as 400 terawatt-hours by 2030—up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020 and higher than the total electricity demand from the entire country of Mexico. There are indications that the data center boom might be decelerating, with some companies slowing or pausing some projects in recent weeks. But even the most measured projections, in analyses like one recent report from the International Energy Agency, predict that energy demand will increase. The only question is by how much. Many of the same tech giants currently scrambling to build data centers have also set climate goals, vowing to reach net-zero emissions or carbon-free energy within the next couple of decades. So they have a vested interest in where that electricity comes from. Nuclear power has emerged as a strong candidate for companies looking to power data centers while cutting emissions. Unlike wind turbines and solar arrays that generate electricity intermittently, nuclear power plants typically put out a constant supply of energy to the grid, which aligns well with what data centers need. “Data center companies pretty much want to run full out, 24/7,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a consultancy focused on electricity and transmission. It also doesn’t hurt that, while renewables are increasingly politicized and under attack by the current administration in the US, nuclear has broad support on both sides of the aisle. The problem is how to build up nuclear capacity—existing facilities are limited, and new technologies will take time to build. In 2022, all the nuclear reactors in the US together provided around 800 terawatt-hours of electricity to the power grid, a number that’s been basically steady for the past two decades. To meet electricity demand from data centers expected in 2030 with nuclear power, we’d need to expand the fleet of reactors in the country by half. New nuclear news Some of the most exciting headlines regarding the burgeoning relationship between AI and nuclear technology involve large, established companies jumping in to support innovations that could bring nuclear power into the 21st century. In October 2024, Google signed a deal with Kairos Power, a next-generation nuclear company that recently received construction approval for two demonstration reactors from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The company is working to build small, molten-salt-cooled reactors, which it says will be safer and more efficient than conventional technology. The Google deal is a long-term power-purchase agreement: The tech giant will buy up to 500 megawatts of electricity by 2035 from whatever plants Kairos manages to build, with the first one scheduled to come online by 2030. Amazon is also getting involved with next-generation nuclear technology with a direct investment in Maryland-based X-energy. The startup is among those working to create smaller, more-standardized reactors that can be built more quickly and with less expense. In October, Amazon signed a deal with Energy Northwest, a utility in Washington state, that will see Amazon fund the initial phase of a planned X-energy small modular reactor project in the state. The tech giant will have a right to buy electricity from one of the modules in the first project, which could generate 320 megawatts of electricity and be expanded to generate as much as 960 megawatts. Many new AI-focused data centers under construction will require 500 megawatts of power or more, so this project might be just large enough to power a single site. The project will help meet energy needs “beginning in the early 2030s,” according to Amazon’s website. X-energy is currently in the pre-application process with the NRC, which must grant approval before the Washington project can move forward. Solid, long-term plans could be a major help in getting next-generation technologies off the ground. “It’s going to be important in the next couple [of] years to see more firm commitments and actual money going out for these projects,” says Jessica Lovering, who cofounded the Good Energy Collective, a policy research organization that advocates for the use of nuclear energy. However, these early projects won’t be enough to make a dent in demand. The next-generation reactors Amazon and Google are supporting are modestly sized demonstrations—the first commercial installations of new technologies. They won’t be close to the scale needed to meet the energy demand expected from new data centers by 2030. To provide a significant fraction of the terawatt-hours of electricity large tech companies use each year, nuclear companies will likely need to build dozens of new plants, not just a couple of reactors. Purchasing power One approach to get around this mismatch is to target existing reactors. Microsoft made headlines in this area last year when it signed a long-term power purchase agreement with Constellation, the owner of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Constellation plans to reopen one of the reactors at that site and rename it the Crane Clean Energy Center. The deal with Microsoft ensures that there will be a customer for the electricity from the plant, if it successfully comes back online. (It’s currently on track to do so in 2028.) “If you don’t want to wait a decade for new technology, one of the biggest tools that we have in our tool kit today is to support relicensing of operating power plants,” says Urvi Parekh, head of global energy for Meta. Older facilities can apply for 20-year extensions from the NRC, a process that customers buying the energy can help support as it tends to be expensive and lengthy, Parekh says. While these existing reactors provide some opportunity for Big Tech to snap up nuclear energy now, a limited number are in good enough shape to extend or reopen. In the US, 24 reactors have licenses that will be up for renewal before 2035, roughly a quarter of those in operation today. A handful of plants could potentially be reopened in addition to Three Mile Island, White says. Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan has received a $1.52 billion loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy to reopen, and the owner of the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa has filed a request with regulators that could begin the reopening process. Some sites have reactors that could be upgraded to produce more power without building new infrastructure, adding a total of between two and eight gigawatts, according to a recent report from the Department of Energy. That could power a handful of moderately sized data centers, but power demand is growing for individual projects—OpenAI has suggested the need for data centers that would require at least five gigawatts of power. Ultimately, new reactors will be needed to expand capacity significantly, whether they use established technology or next-generation designs. Experts tend to agree that neither would be able to happen at scale until at le",

        "description": "Belgium's Court of Appeal's ruling of the Transparency and Consent Framework is in. Here’s what actually happened, and what it means for Google, Amazon, IAB Europe, and everyone else. You’ve seen the headlines: “The TCF is illegal.” “RTB ruled unlawful.” But as usual in advertising, the truth is less clickbait, more caveat. What did happen is this: Belgium’s Court of Appeal finally weighed in on the long-running saga around the Transparency and Consent Framework — the industry’s de facto permission slip for tracking-based advertising in the European Union. Depending on who you ask, the ruling was a win for privacy, a loss for business or just more fuel for a fight that’s far from over. One thing’s clear: it didn’t end the debate — it sharpened it. Still parsing it all? We’ve got you. Here’s what actually happened, and what it means for Google, Amazon, IAB Europe and just about everyone else in the tracking-based ad economy.

Some employees are applauding the move, known as flattening the middle, in the hopes of getting faster and boosting efficiency.Microsoft said Tuesday it's slashing around 6,000 employees. While the days since have made it clear many of those cut were individual contributor-level engineers, executives previously told BI one motivation behind the recent cuts was to increase managers' \"span of control,\" or the number of reports per manager.Intel announced a great flattening last month, emphasizing more time in the office, less admin, and leaner teams.\"The best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,\" said the chip giant's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a memo to staff.Amazon has also increased the ratio of individual contributors to managers. They call it a \"builder ratio.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff late last year that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push. Meta has been at it for years, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing in a 2023 memo, \"flatter is faster.\"The risk is that these companies cut too many managers, leaving the remaining folks with too many direct reports.But for now, it appears to be a risk companies are willing to take.Agility and expertiseThe logic of cutting from the middle to speed up is sound, management experts say.\"You can't go faster and be more connected to a larger ecosystem if you're having to go up and down a hierarchy for every decision,\" Deborah Ancona, a professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Business Insider.While some companies have been trying for decades to zap management layers, there's a new urgency to do so. Businesses exist in \"an exponentially changing world,\" Ancona said.Dell executives explained this to employees earlier this month, when they began reorganizing managers to have more direct reports. The company, whose head count has dropped by 25,000 in two years, also pointed to the influx of artificial intelligence as a reason it needed to move faster.Ideally, companies would remove layers and spread decision-making throughout the organization so that those closest to customers or technology, for example, could generate ideas and make decisions, Ancona said.\"You're kind of flipping the organization,\" she said. \"Rather than all the ideas coming from on high, you have entrepreneurial leaders who are lower down in the organization coming up with new ideas.\"Bayer CEO Bill Anderson is leery of having to run everything up the chain. After taking over the German biotech company in 2023, he began implementing what he calls a \"dynamic shared ownership\" setup that has cut thousands of managers. Staffers come together in \"mini networks\" for 90-day stretches to work on projects.\"We hire highly educated, trained people, and then we put them in these environments with rules and procedures and eight layers of hierarchy,\" Anderson previously told BI. \"Then we wonder why big companies are so lame most of the time.\"Fewer managers, more reporting, more meetings?When middle managers are cut and layers condensed, inevitably, more workers report to fewer managers. The logistics of that vary, and the success in terms of morale has a lot to do with the starting point.Amazon started flattening last year. In September, CEO Andy Jassy ordered a 15% increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers by March. BI reported that senior Amazon Web Services managers received a memo in January instructing them to restrict high-level hiring and increase their number of direct reports.An Amazon spokesperson told BI at the time that the memo may have been intended for one team, but does not apply to the company at large. The Amazon spokesperson also referenced a September memo from Jassy on the importance of reducing management layers.An AWS manager told BI this month that the flatter structure has since put more burden on employees on her team to report on what they're doing day-to-day, in addition to their actual work, since managers have less time to inspect individuals' work.Plus, this manager said they are spending more time in meetings as they took on a more diverse group of direct reports. The Amazon spokesperson also emphasized that the individual employee's anecdote does not represent the company as a whole.Yvonne Lee-Hawkins was assigned 21 direct reports when she worked for Amazon's human resources. She told BI that she had to quickly learn new skills to handle the load, like asynchronous work strategies, but her teams' performance suffered as her number of reports grew from 11 to 21 employees.Weekly one-on-ones — the subject of much debate among tech titans — became impossible, and she had to cut them in half.At Microsoft, a half-dozen employees who spoke to BI about the manager flattening trend generally regarded it as a positive step to eliminate inefficient and unnecessary levels of managers. Some managers have as few as one or two reports.Microsoft ended up with many management layers, the people said, because it often tried to reward good engineers by promoting them to become managers. Often, those engineers-turned-managers still spent most of their time in the codebase and weren't very effective as managers.Meanwhile, larger groups of direct reports often work better for senior employees, who need less one-on-one time and can do more things in a group setting.A Microsoft spokesperson did not comment when asked about these factors.Gary Hamel, a visiting professor at London Business School who lives in Silicon Valley, told BI that pushing managers to take on more direct reports can reduce micromanaging, a common bane of corporate existence.When managers have a lot of people to oversee, it pushes them to hire people they trust, mentor rather than manage, and give up a \"pretty big dose\" of their authority.\"Those are all hugely positive things,\" he said, even if they require \"a fairly dramatic change\" in how managers see their role.How many direct reports is too many?Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously has 60 direct reports. Managers at Dell have been told they should have 15 to 20. An AWS document viewed by BI in January mandated no fewer than eight per manager, up from six. An Amazon spokesperson told BI there are no such requirements companywide.Gallup research indicates that the quality of a manager matters more than the number of direct reports in terms of how well teams perform. That's because more engaged managers tend to lead to more engaged teams. And small teams — those with fewer than 10 people — show both the highest and lowest levels of engagement because managers can have an outsize effect, for better or worse.That may explain why some companies seem to thrive with dozens of direct reports per manager and others fail.The nature of the work matters, too. When work is more complex, it can be harder for managers to oversee too many people.Managing dozens of people gets harder when \"life intersects with work,\" Ravin Jesuthasan, the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI.When employees have an issue, they often need someone to talk to about it.\"As a manager, you are the first port of call,\" he said.That's one reason, Jesuthasan said, that having something like 20 direct reports would likely be \"really hard.\" For most managers, the couple of dozen direct reports that many tech companies are aiming for is probably the limit, he said.Strong managers can powerfully boost a company's ability to develop talent and its bottom line. A 2023 analysis from McKinsey & Company, for example, found that organizations with \"top-performing\" managers led to significantly better total shareholder returns over five years compared with those entities that had only average or subpar managers.While flattening schemes may be successful at reducing bulk in the middle and speeding up decision-making, they can hinder future growth if they're not well-managed.Jane Edison Stevenson, global vice chair for board and CEO services at the organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry, told BI that removing layers from a management pyramid can help elevate those high performers. But flatter companies may fail to develop leaders who can pull together the disparate parts of an organization.At some point, she said, \"You've got to start to make a bet on the leaders that are going to have a chance to build muscle across, not just vertically.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty images; Tyler Le/BIMicrosoft is among the latest to cut middle management jobs.Tech giants like Intel, Amazon, and Google are also flattening structures for efficiency.Experts warn that while flattening can speed decisions, it is possible to take it too far.Companies are shedding bloated layers of management in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy.

Chipmaker Nvidia is reportedly working to lessen its dependency on Big Tech. The company is doing this by forging new partnerships to sell artificial intelligence (AI) to national governments, corporations and challengers to companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (May 18). The report came days after Nvidia announced a multibillion-dollar U.S. chip deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, while the United Arab Emirates announced plans to build one of the world’s largest data centers in partnership with the American government, as the Gulf states work to construct massive AI infrastructure. According to the FT, these “sovereign AI” deals make up a key part of the $3.2 trillion tech giant’s strategy of attracting customers far beyond Silicon Valley. Company executives, industry insiders, and analysts tell the FT that Nvidia aims to boost its business beyond “hyperscalers,” or large cloud computing companies that make up more than half its data center revenue. That means boosting burgeoning rivals to the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, companies that include such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. Nvidia announced in February that CoreWeave was “the first cloud service provider to make the Nvidia Blackwell platform generally available,” referring to its newest generation of processors for AI data centers. The company has also forged collaborations with suppliers such as Cisco, Dell and HP, to help sell to enterprise customers, which manage their own corporate IT infrastructure rather than outsourcing to the cloud. “I’m more certain [about the business opportunity beyond the big cloud providers] today than I was a year ago,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the FT in March. Meanwhile, Nvidia said earlier this month that it is advancing what it calls “embodied intelligence,” or AI that can perceive, reason and act in industries that include manufacturing, biotechnology and transportation. Per a Fast Company report, the company sees these capabilities as critical to future breakthroughs in robotics, drug development and autonomous navigation. “For AI to be truly useful, it must engage meaningfully with real-world use cases,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning, told that magazine. At a tech conference in Singapore last month, Nvidia presented company-authored papers, covering healthcare, robotics, autonomous vehicles and large language models, continuing a collaborative push into AI that has seen partnerships with Google, GE Healthcare and GM.

While MrBeast's net worth is unknown, he said in February 2025 that he's a billionaire on paper.His charitable stunts and giveaways have helped him go viral. In 2021, he challenged participants to remain in a circle and gave the last person to leave $500,000. The video gained over 500 million views.MrBeast also runs a charity organization called Beast Philanthropy, which works on campaigns to donate money and resources. It also runs a food bank, called The Beast Pantry, in North Carolina. The Beast Philanthropy YouTube channel has over 27 million subscribers.Donaldson began incorporating philanthropy into his content back in 2017, after inking his first brand sponsorship deal on YouTube.He was paid $10,000 for the brand deal, and in the video, he gave the money away as tips to pizza delivery drivers.The giveaway changed the trajectory of Donaldson's content strategy. From then on, he created content about giving money away to people in his community, Twitch streamers, and even food delivery drivers.At first, Donaldson's giveaways helped him go viral online, which in turn allowed him to donate more money to various people and charities. But over time, his charity efforts became controversial.Donaldson partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation on an initiative to plant more trees.YouTube/MrBeastMrBeast's philanthropic efforts: from giveaways to charity stuntsMrBeast has given away gobs of cash to a wide range of causes, including planting trees, cleaning the ocean, and even paying for someone's cataract surgery.In 2019, Donaldson hit national news for his online campaign to raise money to plant 20 million trees. He partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation on the movement called #TeamTrees, which even attracted funding from Elon Musk.MrBeast typically funds these charity stunts through his businesses, sponsorship deals, and advertising earnings from his YouTube channel.He's built a team to run his philanthropic efforts. It includes Darren Margolias, who worked in real estate development, and has become the face of Beast Philanthropy.Donaldson's charity efforts have also had a cultural impact, making charity both \"cool\" and entertaining.Some of Donaldson's philanthropy efforts have drawn backlash.Steven KahnBacklash to MrBeast's philanthropyMrBeast's charity stunts have also drawn critics who say his philanthropic efforts are self-serving.For instance, in 2023, he received backlash on Twitter for his video in which he gifted eye surgeries.Donaldson responded on the social platform, now called X, pointing out the irony: \"Twitter - Rich people should help others with their money. Me - Okay, I'll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.

While MrBeast's net worth is unknown, he said in February 2025 that he's a billionaire on paper.His charitable stunts and giveaways have helped him go viral. In 2021, he challenged participants to remain in a circle and gave the last person to leave $500,000. The video gained over 500 million views.MrBeast also runs a charity organization called Beast Philanthropy, which works on campaigns to donate money and resources. It also runs a food bank, called The Beast Pantry, in North Carolina. The Beast Philanthropy YouTube channel has over 27 million subscribers.Donaldson began incorporating philanthropy into his content back in 2017, after inking his first brand sponsorship deal on YouTube.He was paid $10,000 for the brand deal, and in the video, he gave the money away as tips to pizza delivery drivers.The giveaway changed the trajectory of Donaldson's content strategy. From then on, he created content about giving money away to people in his community, Twitch streamers, and even food delivery drivers.At first, Donaldson's giveaways helped him go viral online, which in turn allowed him to donate more money to various people and charities. But over time, his charity efforts became controversial.Donaldson partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation on an initiative to plant more trees.YouTube/MrBeastMrBeast's philanthropic efforts: from giveaways to charity stuntsMrBeast has given away gobs of cash to a wide range of causes, including planting trees, cleaning the ocean, and even paying for someone's cataract surgery.In 2019, Donaldson hit national news for his online campaign to raise money to plant 20 million trees. He partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation on the movement called #TeamTrees, which even attracted funding from Elon Musk.MrBeast typically funds these charity stunts through his businesses, sponsorship deals, and advertising earnings from his YouTube channel.He's built a team to run his philanthropic efforts. It includes Darren Margolias, who worked in real estate development, and has become the face of Beast Philanthropy.Donaldson's charity efforts have also had a cultural impact, making charity both \"cool\" and entertaining.Some of Donaldson's philanthropy efforts have drawn backlash.Steven KahnBacklash to MrBeast's philanthropyMrBeast's charity stunts have also drawn critics who say his philanthropic efforts are self-serving.For instance, in 2023, he received backlash on Twitter for his video in which he gifted eye surgeries.Donaldson responded on the social platform, now called X, pointing out the irony: \"Twitter - Rich people should help others with their money. Me - Okay, I'll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.

        "description": "Streaming and network giants like Amazon, Disney, and NBCUniversal gathered in New York this week to make their best pitches to ad buyers. Jason Momoa, Lizzo, and Dave Bautista at Amazon's upfront presentation.Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for AmazonI attended presentations from Amazon, Disney, Netflix, and others at the TV upfronts in New York.The media industry is in flux, with declining linear TV and economic uncertainty.I saw how media companies are highlighting sports and tech innovations to attract advertisers.This week, I attended events by Amazon, Disney, NBCUniversal, and other streaming and network giants in New York, where they made their biggest pitches of the year to ad buyers.The TV upfronts are an annual series of presentations and parties during which TV ad sellers do their best to sell the bulk of their inventory. Given the jittery macro environment and the decline of linear TV viewing, this year's incarnation was expected to be a buyer's market. A recent EMARKETER forecast estimated that tariffs could drag down this year's haul by as much as $4.1 billion, a 23.5% decline from last year.Still, the show must go on. And as far as I could see, the cloud of uncertainty didn't keep people from coming out. They packed ballrooms and concert halls to get exclusive peeks at the fourth season of \"The Bear\" on Hulu and the sequel to \"Wicked,\" sip free booze, and catch Lady Gaga.But the most entertaining moment of the week had to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, who came to Amazon's upfront to plug his Christmas movie, \"The Man With The Bag.\" He had the crowd both groaning and laughing as he rambled on — until his \"True Lies\" costar Jamie Lee Curtis eased him off the stage.Behind the parties and celeb antics, however, I could get a sense of the changing ad business — and five clear takeaways emerged.1. The world has changedAmid what's usually a celebratory atmosphere, media companies couldn't entirely avoid acknowledging that the world has changed. Sellers had to say enough to show they were sympathetic to the times, but not kill the vibe. This was a party, after all.NBCUniversal's sales chief, Mark Marshall, kicked off the week with a nod at the economic headwinds (and why they shouldn't keep brands from staying on the air). Disney's Rita Ferro also flicked at the uncertain climate and how Disney was all about flexibility, a play to fickle advertisers.On the whole, though, execs tried to keep the mood light. So it was notable when ABC's Jimmy Kimmel made an earnest plea for advertisers to support rival CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" which is in President Donald Trump's crosshairs.2. YouTube loomed, even if media companies dared not speak its nameJimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, with friends at YouTube's Brandcast.Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for YouTubeYouTube's rising TV viewership — and the creator economy it's built on — has been one of the biggest media stories of the past year.Studios have taken note.This year's upfronts offered more signs of the shift, with Amazon renewing top YouTuber MrBeast's \"Beast Games\" for two more seasons, and Fox's free streamer Tubi bringing out social media stars like Noah Beck, who's starring in \"Sidelined 2: Intercepted.\" And of course, YouTube reliably paraded out its biggest creators, including MrBeast and \"Hot Ones\" host Sean Evans, at Brandcast, its take on the upfront presentation.Some legacy media giants like Disney went in the other direction by packing their presentations with famous franchises and Hollywood celebrities. Disney wanted you to know it had more than 100 talent on hand. The Mouse House seemed to be saying, hey, we have Hollywood-quality entertainment — and the stars most ad execs have actually heard of.3. The upfronts aren't just about TV anymoreMark Marshall of NBCUniversal made a grand arrival at NBCU's upfront to promote the sequel to \"Wicked.\"NBCUniversal/Ralph Bavaro/NBCUniversalUpfronts used to be about showing off your fall TV programming, but this week showed how media companies are trying to sell everything they have.Everyone was promoting movies in addition to shows, for advertisers who like to be part of big marketing partnerships. Amazon trotted out the Kelce brothers of its Wondery podcast arm and Lizzo and DJ Steve Aoki to promote its Twitch streamer. Whole Foods appeared on the screen at one moment.\"Now it's, let's showcase everything that we have. It's, 'Here's what we have, pick what appeals to your client,'\" Alicia Weaver-McKinney, VP of media activation at ad agency Mediassociates, said of the broad menu on offer.4. Sports are the new saviorNearly every presentation was front-loaded with live sports as media companies leaned on the programming in their arsenal that's most valuable to advertisers as they looked to drive deals in a shaky ad market.\"If you heard anything other than sports, it was item number two, three, four on the list,\" longtime advertising advisor Michael Kassan said.NBCU bragged that Peacock had more sports than any other streamer, and Jimmy Fallon didn't miss a beat, quipping, \"It's great to be at the NBA upfront.\"NBA-less WBD was forced to talk up its tennis, the NHL, and women's sports. Some buyers privately wondered how sustainable the high prices media companies want for sports will be, though, given the glut of sports inventory out there and hesitance caused by economic uncertainty.5. Big Tech is trying to change the language of TVBela Bajaria, Netflix's content chief, promoted the streamer's engagement figures.Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for NetflixFor the past few years, the tech companies have been crashing upfronts week, with Netflix and Amazon having their second in-person events this year.Now, they want to change the way we talk about and value \"TV.\"Netflix's content head, Bela Bajaria, talked about slate, not slots, to differentiate streamers like Netflix from the old guard of linear TV, and pointed to its big engagement numbers to say Peak TV wasn't over.YouTube's Neal Mohan emphasized how much people are watching podcasts on TV, the value of its creator-funded model of entertainment, and how it's giving creators tools to spiff up their shows with TV viewers in mind.And Amazon touted new interactive ads, data about how much its viewers shop on the platform, and the ability to get them to buy with the click of a remote, something no linear TV company can offer. Every Amazon presenter seemed to be required to utter the phrase, \"Full funnel advertising at scale.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Surface Laptop Studio 2 is reportedly no longer being manufactured. Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay left the company for Amazon in late 2023, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New smaller versions of both of these mainstays were introduced just a couple of weeks ago. But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge reports that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold. Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with its six-year support lifecycle for Surface hardware.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The best titanium cookware is versatile and durable, but expensive. We tested three titanium pans from Our Place, Hestan, and Guy Fieri. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreOur Place, Amazon, Williams Sonoma; Business InsiderGone are the days of picking between cast iron and stainless steel — now the cookware market is saturated with options. We have tested the best cookware extensively, so we know when a new product is actually novel. That's why we got our hands on three pieces of titanium cookware.I tested the three top-rated titanium pans to see how they held up against more traditional forms of cookware. In essence, they perform like a hybrid of nonstick and stainless steel, with great heat conductivity and a slicker surface than uncoated steel. Our Place's Titanum Always Pan Pro won my top spot because of its incredible versatility and ability to distribute heat across its base. It has a patterned interior that transforms into a nonstick surface with the right heat application.Our top-rated titanium pansBest overall: Our Place Titanium Always Pan Pro — See at AmazonBest splurge: Hestan NanoBond Titanium Stainless-Steel Skillet Fry Pan — See at Williams SonomaBest for beginners: Guy Fieri Flavortown Laser Titanium Fry Pan — See at AmazonBest overallOur Place is a BI Reviews team favorite. The original Always Pan is the top pick in our best ceramic cookware guide. With the Titanium Always Pan Pro, the DTC brand took inspiration from a lotus leaf, which has nanostructures that transform it into a water-repellant finish. The pan has a pattern pressed into its titanium surface that grants it hydrophobic and semi-nonstick properties.I appreciated the high, curved sides, which make it a winner for in-oven bakes (like cornbread or skillet brownies) and allow for sauces and curries.Stella Totino/Business InsiderThere's a learning curve to properly heat the pan before introducing ingredients, but once I got the hang of it, the surface was effectively nonstick. I particularly appreciated the Pro when searing; it produces perfectly golden, crispy crusts that release effortlessly from the pan. This ability to smoothly go from, say, scrambled eggs to frying up a pork chop is largely due to the tri-ply construction. Using three metals — aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium — creates a tough and heat-conductive piece of cookware.Out of the three titanium pans I tested, the Always Pan Pro handled the oven the best. It heated evenly across the surface and produced level bakes and roasted edges. I will note that this pan is the heaviest I tested, which made it difficult to move around the kitchen. However, I found its weight a price I was willing to pay for its size (it holds a larger volume than others tested) and top-notch heat conductivity and retention.Best splurgeEven if I didn't know the brand or price, I could tell Hestan's NanoBond is a luxury pan. The detailed craftsmanship is functional and aesthetically pleasing: gently sloping sides, an angled handle, and a lustrous finish. During testing, these details made a difference, especially the ergonomic handle. The center divet and upward angle made it the easiest to grip and transport around the kitchen.Hestan's NanoBond Titanium Stainless Steel cookware is made by bonding blended titanium and chromium-based alloy layers onto a stainless steel body. If this sounds indestructible, we can confirm that it nearly is. The surface is ultra-durable and stood up to serious wear and tear; I'm talking heavy-duty, abrasive scrubbing, cutting directly on the pan's surface, and using metal utensils while cooking. Not a scratch on it.While the interior is shiny and smooth to the touch, it's not nonstick. I found this Hestan to be reminiscent of a traditional stainless steel skillet in that it consistently requires a high-preheated surface or a hefty amount of fat to prevent sticking. Additionally, the NanoBond interior tends to retain a visual imprint of whatever food was last cooked on it. I noticed an almost rainbow-esque colored marking that I got rid of with a splash of vinegar after hand-washing.Aesthetics aside, I was impressed by how well the thick base retained heat evenly across the pan's surface. There was no fear of hot spots, and cooking across the stovetop and oven was seamless.Best for beginnersAt first glance, the Flavortown pan looks and feels like nonstick cookware. It functions just like one with a slick surface that easily releases food. Instead of being covered in ceramic or traditional nonstick coating, the Guy Fieri pan features titanium atop a hard-anodized aluminum body. Just like with the Hestan and Always Pan, using a laser to bond titanium alloy onto the pan's surface allows the pan to tolerate higher temperatures and creates a more durable interior.The Flavortown Laser Titanium essentially functions as a traditional nonstick pan, only a whole lot more durable.Stella Totino/Business InsiderI found the pan easy to handle — it weighs less than the other pans I tried, and the handle was comfortable to hold. In terms of performance, the Flavortown pan slightly underperformed. The bottom of the food cooks more quickly than the interiors, a sign that the pan is prone to overheating and uneven heat distribution. There weren't burn spots, and after a few uses, I figured out that this pan works best over medium heat, even if the recipe calls for high.It's also extremely easy to clean. Whether you pop it in the dishwasher or run a sponge over its surface, food debris slides right off. For a fraction of the price of the others we tested, the Flavortown pan is more competent and cooks better than my traditional nonstick pans.How we test titanium cookwareStella Totino/Business InsiderDuring testing, I identified four key attributes: heat conductivity, heat retention, nonstick properties, and ergonomic ease of use.Cooking: I cooked the same ingredients in each pan on the same heat and compared the results. This showed which pan cooked the quickest and heated evenly. I also used the cooking tests to evaluate how much preheating a pan needed to develop a nonstick surface.Durability: I scrubbed each pan with abrasive sponges and used metal utensils during cooking. I also used the pans under a broiler and noted how they performed in high-heat ovens.Ergonomics: As I cooked and cleaned, I considered the weight and handle dimensions of the pans. Heavier pans can be difficult to move from the stovetop to the oven, but often have better heat retention. All three pans had handles between 8 and 8.5 inches long, which kept my hand away from the heat without making it hard to wield.Titanium in cookwareTitanium is exceptionally lightweight, durable, and scratch-resistant. We're seeing it pop up in cookware as an alternative to stainless steel and to strengthen nonstick coatings. All titanium pots and pans are bonded with other metals, layered or fused with aluminum or stainless steel. Clad cookware gives you the benefits of multiple materials — for example, pairing lightweight and highly conductive aluminum with the strength of titanium.Not every titanium pan looks the same; in fact, the surfaces of these pans vary more in aesthetic and technological construction than stainless steel or nonstick cookware might. Our Place, for example, has an almost hexagonal pattern dappled across its interior, where Flavortown's pan mimics a smooth nonstick.What is titanium nonstick cookware?The last innovation in the best nonstick cookware was the introduction of ceramic coatings. Now, titanium is being used in nonstick coatings as a strengthening agent. Ideally, this results in slick surfaces that are less likely to chip or scratch and, therefore, be thrown away. However, titanium in itself is not nonstick, so the surface may not be as slick or require cooking over a higher heat to prevent sticking.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Many Amazon sellers who were planning to sit out Prime Day are now back in the game — but now they’re under the gun to get goods shipped from China to the U.S. in time. In recent weeks, steep tariffs on Chinese imports had led some brands to opt out of Amazon’s major summer sales event altogether. Others were planning to scale back discounts or delay participation. Now, following a temporary easing of those tariffs, sellers are returning — with lighter promotions, narrower product selections and backup plans in place, according to nine sellers and five consultants who spoke to Modern Retail for this story.

        "description": "Tech giants like Jensen Huang's Nvidia are launching projects to bring AI to every part of healthcare.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesTech's heaviest hitters are racing to build new AI tech for healthcare.They're landing partnerships with health systems and Big Pharma and selling consumer health AI tech.Here's how tech powerhouses from Microsoft to Alphabet to Nvidia are investing in healthcare AI.Artificial intelligence is gaining ground in healthcare, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.Many tech giants have been building healthcare businesses long before the AI boom. Amazon, for example, invested heavily in the industry when it acquired primary care provider One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2022.Now, those tech powerhouses are sharpening their healthcare strategies with AI at the center. Chipmaker Nvidia has rapidly expanded its healthcare ambitions in the past two years, aiming to tackle everything from surgical robotics to drug discovery.Their healthcare ambitions reflect a broader shift: as AI advances, Big Tech sees fresh opportunities for transformation — and revenue — in the complex industry.From AI-powered wearables to robotic surgery, here's how tech's most powerful companies are investing in healthcare AI.Microsoft: Doubling down on its healthcare cloudMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella.Jason Redmond / AFP/ Getty ImagesMicrosoft first entered healthcare nearly two decades ago. Now, it's integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations.Microsoft bought the ambient intelligence company Nuance in 2022 for nearly $20 billion. Nuance dominates the market for AI-powered medical scribing, though it now faces tough competition from startups like $2.75 billion Abridge. Its latest release is Dragon Copilot, a solution Microsoft announced in March that integrates the company's voice dictation tech with Nuance's ambient listening, in a move the company said would help doctors save even more time documenting patient visits.In an October 2024 KLAS report, most healthcare organizations said they considered Nuance when purchasing a clinical documentation solution, in part due to prior contracts with Microsoft and the company's extensive healthcare software suite. The tech giant is integrating AI into those other healthcare cloud offerings to organize and analyze medical records and automate tasks like patient scheduling and paperwork.Microsoft also partners with Nvidia to combine Nvidia's AI tech with Microsoft's cloud solutions to power advanced healthcare and biopharma research and better medical imaging.Apple: Banking on AI-powered consumer health trackingDr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai, Apple's vice president of health.AppleApple's AI efforts have been understated compared to its peers, as have its healthcare investments.Much of Apple's healthcare attention to date has focused on its Apple Watch, which includes several AI-powered health features for consumers, from AI-powered fall detection and irregular heartbeat tracking to sleep analysis.After Apple released its augmented reality headset Apple Vision Pro last year, the company said multiple healthcare organizations were using the new tech for various applications, including reviewing patient surgical plans or training clinicians to use new medical devices.Apple's next big health AI push could be on the horizon. Bloomberg News reported at the end of March that Apple was developing an AI-powered health coach to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations based on its consumers' health data, as tracked through devices like the Apple Watch and iPhone.TK APPLE COMMENTNvidia: Bringing \"physical AI\" to the hospitalKimberly Powell, Nvidia's VP of healthcare.HLTHChip giant Nvidia is digging into a wide range of healthcare specialties, from radiology to drug discovery, primarily by partnering with other healthcare companies.Nvidia VP of healthcare Kimberly Powell told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March. GE Healthcare plans to use Nvidia's tech to simulate autonomous medical imaging, including autonomous X-rays and ultrasounds, to test their application in physical medical devices.It's a similar collaboration to Nvidia's existing deal with IT solutions provider Mark III to work with healthcare systems to create simulations of their hospital environments for AI development. \"Physical AI,\" or AI that can analyze and interact with the physical world, is a key part of Nvidia's vision for healthcare. \"This physical AI thing is coming where your whole hospital is going to turn into an AI,\" Powell told BI in November. \"You're going to have eyes operating on your behalf, robots doing what is otherwise automatable work, and smart digital devices. So we're super excited about that, and we're doing a lot of investments.\"Nvidia is also an investor in several healthcare startups, most notably clinical documentation startup Abridge, which raised $250 million in February from investors including Nvidia's venture arm NVentures at a $2.75 billion valuation, and Hippocratic AI, which raised $141 million in Series B funding from NVentures and other firms at a $1.64 billion valuation.It's also partnered with many of its portfolio companies, such as Moon Surgical, a robotics company that uses Nvidia's medical device AI platform Holoscan for its surgical assistant robot.Amazon: Adding more tech to consumer careAmazon CEO Andy JassyBrendan McDermid/REUTERSAmazon is bringing AI to doctors, patients, and pharma companies across its healthcare businesses.In March, Amazon announced it was testing a new chatbot feature called Health AI, which the company says can give users advice and suggest products for common medical needs. The health AI assistant can direct users to Amazon's online pharmacy or to talk to a doctor at its primary care chain, One Medical, for further care. An Amazon spokesperson told BI that the chatbot is in beta, and the retailer is collecting feedback from customers and working on new features for its AI assistant.The retail giant also offers its own medical transcription tool, called HealthScribe, which analyzes doctor-patient conversations to create clinical notes for providers. It's one of several AI capabilities that One Medical's clinicians use, in addition to features that assist with patient messaging and care coordination.Amazon provides a number of generative AI tools through Amazon Web Services for life sciences companies, too. Genentech and AstraZeneca, for example, have used AWS's AI tools for drug discovery research and clinical trial tasks.Amazon has also suffered more false starts in healthcare than its peers. The retailer shut down its telehealth service Amazon Care in 2022, three years after its launch, and discontinued its wearable fitness tracker Amazon Halo in 2023. Last year, One Medical came under fire after media reports and a malpractice lawsuit raised concerns about the primary care chain's patient safety practices. An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is prohibited by law from discussing patient records, but that One Medical has extensive quality and safe measures in place for patient care.Alphabet: Powering better health research with foundation models and search toolsGoogle's chief health officer Dr. Karen DeSalvo.Google HealthAlphabet has created several healthcare AI tools that build upon Google's core search capabilities, with a focus on healthcare-specific foundation models.Google launched MedLM, a set of healthcare foundation models, in 2023 to enable tech to summarize patient-doctor conversations, conduct clinical research, and automate insurance claims processing. In October, it announced Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, a specialized search engine that gives clinicians answers to their medical questions about a patient's health records or medical documents. It's also built a research AI system designed to assist with patient diagnosis, which can analyze data such as medical images and simulate patient-provider interactions.On the consumer front, Google has released a number of tools with health applications, such as Google Lens, which allows people to take a picture of their own skin and search for visually similar skin conditions. It's also working on personal health AI models that can interpret sleep and fitness data to offer personalized wellness suggestions.Isomorphic Labs, Alphabet's AI research arm spun out of Google DeepMind, has partnered with pharma giants like Novartis and Eli Lilly on more efficient drug development, building on DeepMind's AlphaFold protein structures.Dr. Karen DeSalvo has led Google's health initiatives since 2019. At the beginning of May, she announced her retirement as chief health officer; Google Health chief clinical officer Dr. Michael Howell will replace her when she steps down in August.Oracle: Leveling up health records with AILarry Ellison, cofounder of Oracle.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesOracle's long-awaited plans to revolutionize electronic medical records with AI will come to fruition this year, according to the tech company.In October, Oracle unveiled its \"next-generation\" electronic health record system, which the company said would incorporate several of Oracle's cloud and AI capabilities, including clinical AI agents, search capabilities, and patient data analytics. Its goal is to seamlessly integrate AI into providers' workflows and automate healthcare administrative tasks. The AI-powered EHR is slated for release to early adopters this year, the company said.Oracle made its biggest investment toward this goal in 2022, when it bought EHR company Cerner for $28.3 billion and rebranded it as Oracle Health. Its efforts to transform Cerner have hit a number of snags, however. BI reported in May 2024 that flaws in Cerner's EHR rollout at the Department of Veteran",

Amazon reportedly cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. The layoffs amount to a small portion of the unit’s total workforce, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 14), citing a company spokesperson. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” the spokesperson said, according to the report. Amazon’s devices and services unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox robotaxi, the report said. The spokesperson did not say which divisions saw layoffs, it added. Bloomberg also reported on the job cuts Wednesday, noting that Amazon has made several rounds of layoffs targeting specific departments and the company has about 1.56 million full– and part-time employees. In January, Amazon laid off dozens of people in its communications department. A company spokesperson said at the time that the changes were made after a review “to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and brings teams closer to customers.” It was reported at the time that Amazon has cut tens of thousands of corporate jobs since Andy Jassy became the company’s CEO in 2021. These include 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles. When announcing in January 2023 that Amazon planned to lay off more than 18,000 workers, Jassy said the economy was uncertain, the company had hired rapidly for several years, and leaders across the company were prioritizing the things that matter most to customers and the long-term health of the business. In September, Jassy said Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office. “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy said.

        "description": "The US president is in the Middle East for a trip where several deals are taking place.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesDonald Trump is on a whirlwind tour of the Middle East.His mission? To come away with deals that strengthen ties between the US and oil-rich states.Here are all the deals that have been announced since Trump landed in the region.Donald Trump's Middle East trip had been billed as a dealmaking opportunity — and it's been living up to that expectation. The president's first major overseas tour of his second term has begun with the flow of billions of dollars as US companies have lined up to announce deals with Middle Eastern nations.A flurry of announcements came out of the Saudi-US Investment Forum held in Riyadh on Tuesday, where deal after deal emerged.In January, Trump announced that Saudi Arabia had committed to investing $600 billion in the US over the next four years, a sign that both countries were seeking to build closer ties.Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader and crown prince, has made it a priority for his country to diversify its economy away from oil as part of his grand economic plan, Vision 2030.It's why he has been busy courting business leaders in the US, with the likes of Elon Musk, OpenAI boss Sam Altman, and BlackRock's Larry Fink all in attendance at the investment forum on Tuesday.Here's a look at some of the major deals that have been announced during Trump's visit so far.An arms deal worth $142 billionTrump marked the first day of his Middle East tour with a $142 billion arms deal.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe US and Saudi Arabia struck an arms deal worth nearly $142 billion on the first day of Trump's trip to the Middle East. The White House described it as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"The deal would see the US provide Saudi Arabia with \"state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,\" according to the White House.The services will offer Saudi Arabia defense coverage that includes air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, maritime and coastal security, border security and information and communication systems upgrades, Trump's administration added.Nvidia brings chips to Saudi ArabiaNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is bringing chips to the Middle East.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia's grand plans to become a regional leader in AI depend on its access to highly advanced chips to train and run leading models. That's where Nvidia comes in.The US chipmaker is set to bring at least 18,000 of its Blackwell GPUs to Saudi Arabia as part of an initial deployment phase involving Humain, a new AI subsidiary established by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.Humain's aim is to build so-called AI factories to fulfil its ambitions, with plans to make use of \"several hundred thousand of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs\" over the next five years.A top Nvidia rival is building Saudi ties, tooLisa Su's AMD has struck a $10 billion partnership with Humain.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD, one of the top rivals to Nvidia, has not let down the opportunity to build close ties with Saudi Arabia, either.On Tuesday, the company announced it will work with Humain to invest up to $10 billion in AI compute over the next five years.According to the company, the infrastructure built will involve \"a network of AMD-based AI computing centers stretching from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States.\"Amazon is building an 'AI Zone'Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.REUTERS/Brendan McDermidAmazon Web Services is getting in on the action too, with a more than $5 billion plan to build what it calls an \"AI Zone\" in Saudi Arabia.According to the company, the \"first-of-a-kind\" area will provide a space in which a vastly complex set of infrastructure including servers loaded with chips aimed at delivering \"faster AI training and inference.\"It follows an announcement last year in which AWS said it would bring data centers to the country in 2026 and invest more than $5.3 billion.Google is eyeing Saudi Arabia's AI startupsGoogle is backing a new $100 million AI fund in Saudi Arabia.Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty ImagesBetting on startup talent is a big priority for Saudi venture capital firm STV. It's about to get a helping hand in that process from Google, which is backing STV's $100 million AI investment fund.

To come away with deals that strengthen ties between the US and oil-rich states.Here are all the deals that have been announced since Trump landed in the region.Donald Trump's Middle East trip had been billed as a dealmaking opportunity — and it's been living up to that expectation. The president's first major overseas tour of his second term has begun with the flow of billions of dollars as US companies have lined up to announce deals with Middle Eastern nations.A flurry of announcements came out of the Saudi-US Investment Forum held in Riyadh on Tuesday, where deal after deal emerged.In January, Trump announced that Saudi Arabia had committed to investing $600 billion in the US over the next four years, a sign that both countries were seeking to build closer ties.Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader and crown prince, has made it a priority for his country to diversify its economy away from oil as part of his grand economic plan, Vision 2030.It's why he has been busy courting business leaders in the US, with the likes of Elon Musk, OpenAI boss Sam Altman, and BlackRock's Larry Fink all in attendance at the investment forum on Tuesday.Here's a look at some of the major deals that have been announced during Trump's visit so far.An arms deal worth $142 billionTrump marked the first day of his Middle East tour with a $142 billion arms deal.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe US and Saudi Arabia struck an arms deal worth nearly $142 billion on the first day of Trump's trip to the Middle East. The White House described it as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"The deal would see the US provide Saudi Arabia with \"state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,\" according to the White House.The services will offer Saudi Arabia defense coverage that includes air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, maritime and coastal security, border security and information and communication systems upgrades, Trump's administration added.Nvidia brings chips to Saudi ArabiaNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is bringing chips to the Middle East.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia's grand plans to become a regional leader in AI depend on its access to highly advanced chips to train and run leading models. That's where Nvidia comes in.The US chipmaker is set to bring at least 18,000 of its Blackwell GPUs to Saudi Arabia as part of an initial deployment phase involving Humain, a new AI subsidiary established by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.Humain's aim is to build so-called AI factories to fulfil its ambitions, with plans to make use of \"several hundred thousand of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs\" over the next five years.A top Nvidia rival is building Saudi ties, tooLisa Su's AMD has struck a $10 billion partnership with Humain.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD, one of the top rivals to Nvidia, has not let down the opportunity to build close ties with Saudi Arabia, either.On Tuesday, the company announced it will work with Humain to invest up to $10 billion in AI compute over the next five years.According to the company, the infrastructure built will involve \"a network of AMD-based AI computing centers stretching from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States.\"Amazon is building an 'AI Zone'Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.REUTERS/Brendan McDermidAmazon Web Services is getting in on the action too, with a more than $5 billion plan to build what it calls an \"AI Zone\" in Saudi Arabia.According to the company, the \"first-of-a-kind\" area will provide a space in which a vastly complex set of infrastructure including servers loaded with chips aimed at delivering \"faster AI training and inference.\"It follows an announcement last year in which AWS said it would bring data centers to the country in 2026 and invest more than $5.3 billion.Google is eyeing Saudi Arabia's AI startupsGoogle is backing a new $100 million AI fund in Saudi Arabia.Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty ImagesBetting on startup talent is a big priority for Saudi venture capital firm STV.

American tech giants are reportedly upping their Gulf State investments amid President Trump’s visit to the region. The Trump administration has brokered deals for two Middle Eastern allies — Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — to bolster their artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, Bloomberg news reported Tuesday (May 13). New agreements with the U.S., expected to be announced in the days ahead, will give the two countries more access to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the report said. But even before any official announcement of deals between the U.S. and its partners, reports began to surface of American firms preparing new projects in the region, Bloomberg added. For example, Nvidia is set to supply its most advanced artificial intelligence-related chips to Saudi Arabia’s Humain, a company started to advance the country’s AI infrastructure efforts. Under this agreement, Humain will get “several hundred thousand” of Nvidia’s most advanced processors over the next five years. Humain and Amazon are also investing upwards of $5 billion on an “AI zone” in Saudi Arabia, the report added. The project will use tech from the Amazon Web Services cloud business to develop a marketplace of AI agents for use by the Saudi government. In another proposed deal, OpenAI is mulling developing new data center capacity in the United Arab Emirates that could massively expand its footprint in the Middle East, according to sources familiar with the matter. This deal could be announced in time for Trump’s UAE visit Thursday (May 15), Bloomberg said, noting that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also in the Middle East as part of a larger tour by tech leaders. PYMNTS explored AI’s potential to transform the Middle East in a report last year after Saudi Arabia established a $40 billion AI investment fund. “Successful AI development efforts could not only lead to a wave of local creativity and innovation such as new startups, and attracting generation of students to the field, but could spread the resulting prosperity across the region, countering local disbalances and democratizing the knowledge economy to attract the brightest minds,” geopolitical analyst Irina Tsukerman said in an interview for that report. And projects like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, boasting more than $900 billion in assets, is working to establish itself as a global AI leader, Bas Kooijman, CEO and asset manager at DHF Capital, said in an interview with PYMNTS. “The fund could spur innovation, attract global tech partnerships, and accelerate AI adoption across various industries within the region, contributing significantly to Saudi Arabia’s GDP,” he added.

        "description": "Amazon will outsource delivery of large packages to FedEx in a deal that should prove more profitable on a per-shipment level than shipments under the companies’ partnership that ended six years ago. The post Amazon taps FedEx for big-and-bulky residential deliveries appeared first on FreightWaves. Six years after breaking up, Amazon and FedEx are back together. The retail giant has reached a long-term agreement with FedEx to provide limited residential package delivery, the companies have confirmed. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently added FedEx (NYSE: FDX) to its roster of vendors providing last-mile transportation of goods purchased on its marketplace, Amazon said in a statement provided by spokesman Steve Kelly. “FedEx joins our other third-party partners, like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, that work alongside our own last-mile delivery network to help us balance capacity to best serve customers,” the statement said. FedEx said in a separate statement that the multiyear agreement covers “residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.” FedEx Chief Commercial Officer Brie Carere, speaking Monday evening at a Bank of America investor conference, noted the Amazon contract will be financially accretive with yields and weights above system average in the U.S. ground market, according to a transcript of the event. She said the deal leverages FedEx’s ability to move heavy, hard-to-handle packages across all U.S. ZIP codes. More than two-thirds of packages shipped by Amazon are delivered by its own network of warehouses and delivery drivers, according to the company. Few details of the deal, including expected volumes for FedEx, were disclosed. Amazon vehemently denied that the deal is intended to replace service provided by UPS, which decided in January to reduce Amazon volumes by more than 50% by mid-2026 because the business wasn’t profitable. UPS recently said the decoupling with Amazon, its largest customer in 2024, will result in 20,000 jobs being eliminated. Business Insider broke the story on Monday with a report, based on an internal Amazon email, that said FedEx will take over the Amazon package business previously handled by UPS (NYSE: UPS). FedEx offered better pricing than UPS, according to the publication. The report also said that FedEx will support Amazon’s Extra Large delivery network, AMXL, which is responsible for fulfilling orders, delivery and installation for large, heavy and bulky items, such as furniture and appliances. Amazon said that “the reference to AMXL is premature at this point.” In 2019, FedEx ended its domestic ground-delivery contract with Amazon because of what it perceived as difficult service requirements and low yields. Estimates at the time suggested FedEx transported 4% of Amazon’s ground traffic. Prior to the split, Amazon had diverted much of its business from FedEx’s SmartPost service (since removed), in which FedEx Ground tendered packages to the U.S. Postal Service for final deliveries to residences. “Given this new business [for heavy and large packages] is likely to support above average revenue per shipment, we expect the mix contribution from new Amazon deliveries should support higher yields for FedEx’s core domestic package network operation,” said Barclays’ transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski in a research note. “We suspect this new deal with Amazon is likely to be more favorably priced than in the past and aligns with the company’s broader focus on improving revenue quality within the network.” Oglenski said he suspected higher pricing from UPS at least partially explains Amazon’s motivation to add another delivery partner. FedEx is likely able to take a second look at Amazon now because the company’s business optimization and efficiency campaign, combined with the merger of the Express and Ground networks, is significantly reducing its cost structure. With lower operating costs, FedEx can offer more competitive pricing, Oglenski said. As UPS downsizes domestic capacity to reflect the departure of Amazon volumes, it will likely increase parcel prices with remaining customers to offset reduced economies of scale, he added. “We expect higher pricing from UPS over the long-run will create incremental opportunities for FedEx to capture market share given the cost disparity we see developing between the two package delivery competitors,” Oglenski said.

        "description": "Amazon leaned into the advertising funnel in a big way during its 2025 Upfront event at the Beacon Theater in New York City on Monday night. Perhaps the most notable product enhancement the company unveiled was the use of AI to generate contextual advertising on its Prime Video platform—meaning that ads can and will be created on the fly, using AI, depending on the specific scene of a TV show or movie that is on the screen at any given time. For instance, if a viewer is watching a scene involving a loving phone call between a mother and daughter, pausing the show could result in an ad for mobile phone service, with AI-generated text dynamically created, right then and there. The ability gives Amazon’s massive advertising artillery even more firepower. Amazon execs at the event noted that its Prime Video service now has a global audience of more than 300 million, up from 275 million a year ago, and that engagement also increased 40% over the past year. A star-studded pitch to advertisers Amazon’s Upfront event was loaded with stars showcasing new projects for Prime Video. That included appearances by Michael B. Jordan, discussing a new Creed spinoff TV show called Delphi; Arnold Schwarzenegger (who stole the show with a 15-minute rambling appearance loaded with jokes about his old age) talking about his upcoming Christmas movie; John Cena talking about his new movie due out this summer with Idris Elba; and Jamie Lee Curtis, who announced that she’s producing and starring in a new series, Scarpetta, alongside Nicole Kidman. The series will be an adaptation of the popular book series authored by Patricia Cornwell. Curtis later joined Schwarzenegger on stage to reminisce about the 1990s action movie True Lies in which they both starred. Other announcements include the December return of Fallout, which will air its second season, and was also renewed for a third season. Nicolas Cage was also announced as playing Spider-Man in Spider-Noir, which will be available to watch in either color or black-and-white. Two new seasons of Beast Games are also on the way. Finally, sports were front and center. The NFL will continue with Thursday night games on Prime, and Prime will also host a Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia, and a Christmas Day game between Denver and Kansas City. Additionally, the NBA inked an 11-year deal with Prime, which will see 65 regular-season games air on the service, along with some playoff games.",

        "description": "Amazon in just the past few days lost a driver-related case in Indiana, was a possible scam victim in Connecticut and had a driver involved in a fatal accident in Tennessee. The post Amazon involved in legal action over deaths in 2 states, possible scam in 1 appeared first on FreightWaves. Amazon has found itself involved in three recent legal developments regarding its trucking operations. In one, it suffered a setback in Indiana in a lawsuit involving a driver who was killed near a fulfillment center. In another, prosecutors in Connecticut said the company was scammed out of $3 million. And in the third, a tractor-trailer pulling an Amazon load near Chattanooga, Tennessee, was involved in an accident that led to multiple deaths and charges against the driver. In the Indiana case, a three-judge panel at the state’s Court of Appeals last week unanimously overturned a lower court decision from June 2023 that dismissed a lawsuit filed by the estate of Harvail Singh Dhillon, an independent owner-operator who was killed near an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) fulfillment center in Greenfield in October 2022. According to the court’s recap of the case, Dhillon was making a delivery to the Amazon facility, which he was not familiar with, and got lost trying to enter the grounds. He pulled to the side of a road that went past the fulfillment center, got out of the truck to cross the road, and was struck and killed by a fuel carrier. One of the surrounding roads that also had entrances had a “no trucks” sign, according to the recap. The only directions from Amazon, the recap said, were an address and a time of delivery. The Court of Appeals described the Amazon facility as having two entrances on the north side but with “no truck” signs present. “There was no signage posted at either of the two entrances to inform incoming truck drivers as to where they were expected to enter the facility,” the court said. There was a third entrance as well. Dead driver described as ‘confused’ The result, according to the court: Dhillon “became confused … as he could not discern any other entrances serving the facility.” Dhillon was attempting to deliver goods to Amazon at 6:40 a.m. in October, when it was still dark. He pulled his truck over on one of the roads, the court wrote, got out to figure out what to do, and was immediately struck and killed by the tanker truck. It wasn’t the first time; according to the court, there had been another incident 48 days earlier in which a driver was struck at Greenfield. That also led to a lawsuit by the driver, Mahari Oukbo, an independent owner-operator who survived. The Court of Appeals, citing testimony from the Oukbo case, quoted the driver who struck Oukbo as saying that “you see these truck drivers all the time stopping and getting out here” because they were confused as to where to go. Also in that case, according to the court, citing Oukbo-related testimony, an Amazon employee told local police that he “sees these lost truck drivers get out of their trucks at this spot every day.” Dhillon’s estate filed suit, saying confusion it blamed on Amazon created an “imminent danger” to drivers. But the argument lost on the lower court level in June 2023, with the judge saying Amazon had “no duty” in part because the incident occurred off Amazon property. In overturning the lower court and sending the case back to it for further proceedings, the Court of Appeals relied on a precedent from a 1994 case. A hospital was ruled negligent after a woman was struck on the grounds of the facility. The Court of Appeals’ conclusion last week was that Dhillon’s estate had “sufficiently alleged that Amazon used its premises in a manner that harbored a dangerous condition off its own premises, i.e., on the county road, that affected the risk of injury to others. Amazon’s lack of signage and its failure to direct delivery truck drivers where to enter the fulfillment center created confusion and a dangerous condition.” The Oukbo case took a similar path: The driver lost on the lower court level in Indiana in the suit against Amazon and CF Mount Comfort DST, which the court collectively refers to as Amazon, but the Court of Appeals reversed. A recent request by the attorneys for Amazon for a transfer of the Court of Appeals case to the Supreme Court was denied. (Indiana law defines “transfer” as accepting jurisdiction in a case by the state’s highest court.) If the Oukbo case then is headed back to the lower court – attorneys for Oukbo had not responded to queries by publication time – it will mean there are two cases in the state involving Amazon’s responsibility for proper directions and signage at one of its fulfillment facilities. Amazon’s press relations team had not responded to an email by publication time. Fraud costs estimated at $3 million In the federal indictment in which Amazon is alleged to be a victim, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut said a 24-year-old named Ameer Nasir was hit Wednesday with a 13-count indictment charging wire fraud. According to the indictment, between December 2019 and February 2021, Nasir “evaded” a security feature in Amazon Relay, the transportation management system of Amazon Logistics. According to the indictment, Amazon Relay would allow a trucking company that accepted the task of moving an Amazon trailer to “virtually check out a trailer at the initial location, and then to check in the same trailer at the destination location once the trailer movement was complete.” By getting through the geofencing capabilities in Amazon Relay, according to the indictment, Nasir was able to show that he had “completed trailer movements which he had not, in fact, completed.” According to the indictment, Nasir would then submit invoices to Amazon. The company did make deposits to Nasir’s companies. The total number of submitted trailer moves by Nasir: more than 1,000, resulting in the payments of more than $3 million. Multiple carrier names were registered by Nasir, including Pak Express, Adam Express and Roadstar Logistics. The U.S. attorney’s office said each offense carries a maximum imprisonment of 20 years on each count. Deaths on the highway near Chattanooga In the third legal incident involving Amazon and drivers in just the past few days, a driver hauling freight for Amazon was involved in a crash Sunday near Chattanooga, Tennessee, that led to multiple deaths. (Drivers hauling an Amazon trailer are either independent owner-operators or work for a fleet that is working for Amazon. Amazon does not employ a driver fleet.) The truck involved in the Chattanooga-area accident that led to fatalities and charges against the driver. Photo courtesy of WDEF news channel 12 in Chattanooga. FreightWaves has requested the full incident report from local authorities. But other local outlets report the crash that occurred on Interstate 75 northbound at the Tennessee/Georgia line resulted in two deaths. The driver, Joseph Antoinier, was taken to the hospital and later booked into the Hamilton County Jail on multiple charges, including reckless homicide and felony reckless endangerment.

        "description": "Photo courtesy of Jenn ChoAmazon hired 27-year-old Jenny Cho right out of college.Cho said she instantly became a high achiever and completely burned out after five years.After taking a mental health leave, she switched her focus to trade-offs instead of balance.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jenn Cho, a 27-year-old Amazon software developer in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.I got hired at Amazon directly out of college in 2019 and made work my life and identity.I put so much pressure on myself to be a high achiever and to prove I was a valuable employee in my early career. By the end of 2024, I had completely burned out.I took a 12-week leave to focus on my mental health and realized my job wasn't the issue, it was my mindset. Here's how I identified my burnout and how I'm trying to prevent it from happening again.Everything was great for me until a stressful project in 2024When I got hired as a support engineer, my job was really exciting. We moved quickly, and I felt like a sponge, absorbing everything, and craving to learn more.Then, in 2024, Amazon entered a very stressful layoff season, which greatly affected my team. Our organization underwent a lot of restructuring and reprioritization of our projects.I started working on a particularly difficult project and really put pressure on myself to be on point at all times. But in the pursuit of doubling down on work and working longer hours, I started lacking motivation, struggling with focus, and feeling emotionally exhausted. I was able to keep up with deadlines, but I felt like I was in survival mode.When I stopped enjoying my hobbies, I realized I was burned outThe wake-up call that something needed to change didn't come until I realized I wasn't even enjoying the things I love to do — working out, spending time with friends, pursuing hobbies. I knew I was burned out.A friend of mine who had recently burned out and taken a leave, encouraged me to take my own leave. After sitting on the idea for a while, I submitted a request with the support of my therapist, and I was approved for a 12-week leave at the end of 2024.Taking a break from work and building something for myself was fulfillingAt the start of my leave, I broke out in full-body hives, which I suspect might've been stress-induced. After nearly six weeks of treating my health issues, I finally settled into my leave.I explored Seattle more, got back into my workout routine, and even started working on some personal projects like a food blog site. It was so fulfilling to build something for myself. I considered taking a sabbatical or a more extended leave, but ultimately decided to stick with my 12-week plan.I realized the biggest thing that needed to change when I was to return to Amazon was my mindset.

It's been edited for length and clarity.I got hired at Amazon directly out of college in 2019 and made work my life and identity.I put so much pressure on myself to be a high achiever and to prove I was a valuable employee in my early career. By the end of 2024, I had completely burned out.I took a 12-week leave to focus on my mental health and realized my job wasn't the issue, it was my mindset. Here's how I identified my burnout and how I'm trying to prevent it from happening again.Everything was great for me until a stressful project in 2024When I got hired as a support engineer, my job was really exciting. We moved quickly, and I felt like a sponge, absorbing everything, and craving to learn more.Then, in 2024, Amazon entered a very stressful layoff season, which greatly affected my team. Our organization underwent a lot of restructuring and reprioritization of our projects.I started working on a particularly difficult project and really put pressure on myself to be on point at all times. But in the pursuit of doubling down on work and working longer hours, I started lacking motivation, struggling with focus, and feeling emotionally exhausted. I was able to keep up with deadlines, but I felt like I was in survival mode.When I stopped enjoying my hobbies, I realized I was burned outThe wake-up call that something needed to change didn't come until I realized I wasn't even enjoying the things I love to do — working out, spending time with friends, pursuing hobbies. I knew I was burned out.A friend of mine who had recently burned out and taken a leave, encouraged me to take my own leave. After sitting on the idea for a while, I submitted a request with the support of my therapist, and I was approved for a 12-week leave at the end of 2024.Taking a break from work and building something for myself was fulfillingAt the start of my leave, I broke out in full-body hives, which I suspect might've been stress-induced. After nearly six weeks of treating my health issues, I finally settled into my leave.I explored Seattle more, got back into my workout routine, and even started working on some personal projects like a food blog site. It was so fulfilling to build something for myself. I considered taking a sabbatical or a more extended leave, but ultimately decided to stick with my 12-week plan.I realized the biggest thing that needed to change when I was to return to Amazon was my mindset. Finding fulfillment through my hobbies made me realize that work shouldn't be my life; it should fuel my ability to live my life and pursue my passions.When I got back from my leave, it felt like nothing had changed, and I needed to set boundariesI was concerned about taking a leave, but I don't think it hindered my career at all.After returning to work, I realized that I was just one of thousands of employees.

        "description": "Danielle Carney, head of live sports and video sales at Amazon, shares how the platform is wooing brands on its CTV pitch. At this year’s upfront negotiations, advertisers are set to weigh tariff impacts and consumer sentiments against big-ticket TV deals and major media investments. eMarketer projects that linear TV upfront spending will fall 9.1% compared with last year, for example, a drop fueled by economic concerns and the march of streaming platforms. That doesn’t mean advertising’s subplots are going to take a pause. Take Amazon, for example. The tech giant’s ad revenues increased 18% year-on-year in first quarter 2025 to $13.9 billion — and CTV is a single, if key, part of that business. A megabucks deal for NBA streaming rights last year saw Amazon Prime Video add to its range of live sports coverage, which also includes coverage of the NFL, MLB, Premier League soccer and NASCAR.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "Before the rise of competitors such as Kick and YouTube, Twitch was the only major platform for livestreaming creators. As platforms increasingly compete for livestreaming creators and their audiences, Twitch’s discovery issues remain a sticking point for some streamers. It’s been just over a year since Twitch launched its Discovery Feed in April 2024. The feed, a TikTok-style endless scroll of vertical video clips and current livestreams, was Twitch’s first product explicitly intended to help viewers discover new streamers without having to leave the platform. Twitch claims the new feed has had a measurable impact on discovery and user growth, with more than half of new viewer video views now coming through the feed and roughly 38 million new creator follows being driven through Discovery-Feed-related video playback, according to Twitch chief monetization officer Mike Minton.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Amazon will have FedEx deliver large packages to the retailer’s customers for the first time in six years. The companies reached a multiyear agreement that renews a relationship that ended in 2019, Bloomberg reported Monday (May 12). The deal follows a January announcement by UPS that it will cut the number of packages it delivers for Amazon by half by the end of next year, according to the report. Amazon said in the report that it does not plan to use FedEx to replace the business it still does with UPS; instead, FedEx will serve as one of several third-party partners that deliver to the retailer’s customers, per the report. “FedEx joins our other third-party partners like UPS and the USPS, that work alongside our own last mile delivery network to help us balance capacity to best serve customers,” Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said in the report. Amazon’s own logistics network, which is made up of small businesses, delivers more than two-thirds of the retailer’s packages, according to the report. A FedEx spokesperson said in the report: “We have reached a mutually beneficial, multiyear agreement to provide residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.” UPS said April 29 that it was accelerating its planned volume reduction from Amazon, a longtime major customer, as part of UPS’ pivot away from low-margin, high-volume accounts and toward more profitable business. Amazon’s insourcing of logistics has been an industrywide headwind, and UPS’ proactive recalibration could be a prudent step toward margin expansion, even if it results in near-term revenue pressure, PYMNTS reported at the time. FedEx said in August 2019 that it planned to conclude its ground-delivery contract with Amazon and would not renew it. The logistics company had already ended its express U.S. shipping contract early that summer. “This change is consistent with our strategy to focus on the broader eCommerce market, which the recent announcements related to our FedEx Ground network have us positioned extraordinarily well to do,” a spokesperson for FedEx said at the time. News had surfaced in June 2019 that FedEx would not be renewing its express U.S. contract with Amazon, calling the move a strategic decision.

        "description": "Amazon has secured a new partnership with FedEx to fill delivery gaps after falling out with UPS, Business Insider has learned. Amazon and FedEx delivery trucks: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesAmazon has partnered with FedEx to fill some delivery gaps left by UPS.UPS announced earlier this year that it would significantly reduce deliveries for Amazon.FedEx and Amazon had cut ties in 2019 due to rising competition between the two companies.Amazon is going back to FedEx after falling out with UPS.According to an internal document obtained by Business Insider, Amazon signed a new partnership deal with FedEx in late February to handle some parts of its package deliveries.The FedEx deal gives Amazon \"cost favorability\" compared to UPS, the document said, indicating the retail giant stands to save money from the transition.The document doesn't specify the extent of the deal or which Amazon packages will be handled by FedEx.\"Securing FedEx capacity is our primary solution for these capacity constraints,\" the internal document said.FedEx shares popped in after-hours trading on Monday, following BI's exclusive reporting. In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson confirmed the new partnership.\"We've reached an agreement with FedEx to serve as one of several third-party partners to deliver packages to our customers,\" the spokesperson said in an email statement. \"FedEx joins our other third-party partners like UPS and the USPS, that work alongside our own last mile delivery network to help us balance capacity to best serve customers.\"The renewed alliance between Amazon and FedEx adds a notable twist to the broader shipping industry.FedEx and Amazon cut ties in 2019 as the two companies increasingly competed in the logistics and delivery space. At the time, FedEx said it would focus on other e-commerce customers instead. Amazon's then-operations lead Dave Clark downplayed the fallout, writing on X that FedEx was a \"very small piece of our network and vice versa.\"Logistics consulting firm MWPVL estimates FedEx currently handles no Amazon packages in the US. (Third-party sellers on Amazon's marketplace are still able to use FedEx as a shipping option).The FedEx deal follows UPS's announcement earlier this year that it would reduce its shipping volume for Amazon packages by more than half by the end of 2026. Despite Amazon being its largest customer, the company cited profitability concerns as the reason for slowly winding down the partnership.According to the internal document obtained by BI, Amazon's Extra Large delivery network, which ships bulky items like TVs and furniture, expects to get some delivery support from FedEx through this new deal. In the second half of this year, Amazon's Extra Large delivery team plans to \"leverage FedEx for 100%\" of any capacity risks, it added.Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the Amazon document's reference to the extra-large delivery team's plans was \"premature at this point.\"Meanwhile, Amazon's in-house logistics service has since surpassed FedEx and UPS in shipping volume.According to Pitney Bowes, Amazon shipped 6.3 billion parcels in 2024, up 7.3% from the year before, and far ahead of UPS's 4.7 billion and FedEx's 3.7 billion. USPS was the only carrier ahead of Amazon at 6.9 billion packages.Amazon previously disclosed that more than two-thirds of its packages are delivered through its own logistics network in the US.Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company regularly works third-party delivery partners to \"balance capacity,\" and the FedEx deal is not meant to replace UPS entirely.Have a tip?

        "description": "There’s no question that Amazon is known for its packaging. Boxes and mailers with the ubiquitous smile logo now dot the porches of every neighborhood in the country. And with the company’s 2017 purchase of Whole Foods, it became a major player in food packaging as well, wrapping everything from produce to potato chips. Since then, the chain has expanded to 535 locations and increased its sales 40%. That means that every day, millions of people take home some food wrapped in plastic from Whole Foods—but probably rarely think about the packaging. But in a nondescript warehouse in a still-industrial part of Seattle, five scientists at Amazon’s Sustainable Materials Innovation Lab are trying to design a better package.This work is twofold. First, researchers are putting dozens of bio-based plastics through a gauntlet of tests on things like tensile strength, tear strength, and seal strength to see how they compare to their fossil-fuel-based counterparts. Second, they’re working with a handful of partners to make sure that when this packaging hits the market, there’s a recycling infrastructure already in place that can support it.[Photo: courtesy Amazon]“Our long-term objective is to enable simplicity and recycling of plastics in the same way that you have paper today,” says Alan Jacobsen, the director of Materials and Energy Sciences at the lab. “You don’t need to know, is it a 1, 2, 3, 4. You just throw it.”The intense focus on circularity sands in stark contrast to the overconsumption that Amazon’s business model entails—and the vast amounts of junk it distributes, particularly with the recent launch of Haul, where every item is under $20. Jacobsen, for his part, says that he knows people are going to buy products at “a range of price points. . . . We try to figure out how to enable that in the most sustainable way.” And the company says it intends to make the research and technology available beyond Amazon, which means that if it’s successful, it could lead to a fundamental change in packaging—and recycling—throughout the economy.[Photo: courtesy Amazon]The challenges of designing food packagingLast October, Amazon announced that it had swapped out all of its plastic fillers with paper, part of its overall commitment to reducing plastic use. Paper isn’t just more environmentally friendly than plastic, it also has much higher rates of recycling (68% compared to 6%). “When you’re at home recycling paper, you just throw it in the bin and you know it’s going to get recycled,” Jacobsen says. “Because it’s easier to recycle, it’s recycled more.”But for some applications, paper just isn’t a viable solution. That’s especially true for food packaging “because of the physical properties of the material,” says Jacobsen. “Sometimes this has to do with the tear strength or puncture strength; sometimes it has to do with the moisture barrier properties or oxygen barrier properties—just properties that it is not possible for paper to meet.”Food packaging has to keep potato chips crispy and pretzels salty and baby carrots wet; it has to be tough enough that a pile of apples don’t tear open the bag, with a seal strong enough that frozen peas don’t spill all over the floor (while still being easy to open). Food has way more demands of its packaging than something like a book, a tube of lipstick, or even a set of dishes. The default solution to this has always been plastic. But Jacobsen and his team are working on a replacement: biopolyesters. That means the plastic is biodegradable and uses biological materials, waste, or recycled content as the feedstock (or raw material used to make the plastic). [Photo: courtesy Amazon]But this packaging doesn’t just have to be developed, tested, and produced—Amazon also wants it to be easily recyclable, which is where things get even more complicated. Our current recycling infrastructure is finicky: It’s not good at differentiating between different types of plastic, and if it gets confused, it errs on the side of landfill. (Because if the different types of plastic get bundled together, it downgrades the entire bale, which means less money for the recycling facility.)Jacobsen and his team want to eliminate this problem entirely. They want to make biopolyesters that are a blend of feedstocks (including different types of recycled plastic) and then have recycling plants (called “materials recovery facilities,” or MRFs) be able to take it all in, easily separate it, and find a home for these streams.“But one new type of material is not going to work,” says Jacobsen. “You’re going to need a range of different materials. You often have to blend these materials together. You have to put them in different layers to meet the requirements for a particular application.” But most recycling facilities aren’t set up to deal with these kinds of mixed waste streams in a single piece of packaging. So Amazon is working with a network of other companies to help redesign the plastic recycling infrastructure to make it simple for their designs to always be made into something new.[Photo: courtesy Amazon]Glacier—designing robots to go through the trashMuch of the recycling infrastructure in the United States is built on MRFs. These massive warehouses take in gobs of recycling—cardboard boxes and wine bottles and take-out containers and everything in between—and sort hundreds of tons of waste each day. But in the course of that sorting, a lot of otherwise recyclable stuff can get missed or thrown out, maybe because the machines can’t tell what it is, maybe because it gets mixed in with other items. That means a lot of theoretically recyclable materials get sent to the landfill, and also that a lot of bundles of recycled plastic are too degraded with other materials to be properly reused. Glacier, a San Francisco-based company that Amazon invested in last fall, designed a robot to eliminate these pain points. It can sort through more than 30 different types of material, meaning the end bales are more accurate, and fewer items get trashed. (One company, for example, added a Glacier robot, and found that its paper bales were 17% more pure as a result.)[Photo: courtesy Amazon]“Our society tends to view recycling as a nice alternative to landfilling our trash,” says Rebecca Hu-Thrams, one of the cofounders. “[But] we very much see recycling as an absolutely crucial pillar of society’s necessary transition toward circular manufacturing. In other words, recycling is at its core a way to get your hands on more raw feedstocks, more materials to turn into new stuff.”Hu-Thrams referenced a customer in the Midwest that installed one of Glacier’s AI camera’s on what’s known as a “last chance line,” where all the trash leaves the facility and there’s one more shot to pick out recyclable items. This facility quickly realized that about two-thirds of its total “leakage” was coming from beverage bottles; when they identified where and why this was happening, they were able to fix the issue. “So in the span of a couple of weeks or less, they actually are now on track to rescue 15 million more of these PET bottles every single year that would’ve ended up in landfill,” says Areeb Malik, Glacier’s other cofounder.[Image: courtesy of the author]Amazon plans to install one of these robotic systems in its lab next month. The goal is that as they develop new biopolyesters that are a mix of materials, they can simultaneously be training the system to recognize them and mark them as recyclable—never getting confused and thinking they belong in the trash.“We want to make sure that once the materials are out in the market, we know that they’ll be identified in these systems right away,” says John Shane, a principal materials engineer who worked in Amazon’s lab for three years. “And we’ll be able to generate data sets here that we can share with Glacier and then they can share with their customers.” As that information is fed back to the companies, they’ll ideally be able to design packaging that’s easier to recycle (and better identified by the robot).That’s a huge priority for Amazon, which plans to share what it learns from its biopolyester development. “We don’t want to own the IP and keep it to ourselves,” says Jacobsen. “We want everybody to have access; we have no financial motivation.”[Photo: Amazon]EsterCycle—designing chemicals to break down the plasticsBut even if Glacier’s tech scales up and is able to identify much more theoretically recyclable plastic, the current recycling infrastructure isn’t necessarily able to transform that into new products. And that’s the problem EsterCycle is trying to solve. The Denver-based startup spun out of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory last August, after completing a successful project with Amazon on mixed recycling waste. Julia Curley was a postdoctoral researcher at NREL working on the project; she’s now EsterCycle’s founder and only full-time employee. Curley stresses that EsterCycle isn’t looking to upend traditional recycling processes—it’s developing an entirely new one. The goal is to be additive to the current system, taking what MRFs now see as contaminated, lower quality plastic and transforming it into materials that can be made into new products.[Photo: courtesy Amazon]Our existing system essentially collects bales of similar plastic; shreds, washes, and melts it; and then turns it into something new: It’s a mechanical process. EsterCycle, on the other hand, is working on chemical recycling. “Plastics are made of these long chains of molecules called polymers,” Curley says. “And what we’re doing is actually cutting that chain into its individual components, kind of like taking apart a large string of Legos into its individual pieces. And then they can be remade into new plastics.",

In an exclusive interview with PYMNTS, S&P Global Chief AI Officer Bhavesh Dayalji said he sees agentic artificial intelligence (AI) as the next transformational wave for business analysis and workflows. The financial information giant has enabled its AI agents to work with other AI agents across companies and the sector. S&P Global’s Kensho LLM-ready API lets clients integrate its datasets into their GenAI models. The API is compatible with OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and others. For example, some of its commodities data shows up in Microsoft Copilot. The next phase for S&P Global is “ensuring that our data shows up in these new ecosystems that are being developed,” Dayalji said.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the hire reflects the company’s evolution into a global product provider, infrastructure builder and nonprofit organization. “Each of these is a massive effort that could be its own large company,” Altman wrote in a blog post. “Bringing on exceptional leaders is a key part of doing that well.” Simo will oversee OpenAI’s Applications division, focused on scaling the company’s user-facing products as it enters a new phase of growth. Read more: OpenAI Picks Instacart Chief Fidji Simo to Oversee Operations OpenAI Unveils New Corporate Structure OpenAI has abandoned plans to convert to a corporate structure where the for-profit arm is in charge, after speaking with the attorneys general of California and Delaware as well as civic leaders. Instead, it will keep its nonprofit parent and convert the capped-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which is a for-profit entity whose mission must also include a public good. The old set-up had the nonprofit parent controlling the capped-profit subsidiary, which puts a ceiling on the ROI of investors. The PBC would have no such ceiling, allowing OpenAI to attract much more funding to pay for expensive training of its AI models and building of data centers. Elon Musk, who sued to stop the for-profit conversion, will not drop his lawsuit, his attorney told PYMNTS. Read more: OpenAI to File Scaled-Back Restructuring That Keeps Nonprofit in Charge Amazon and Walmart go Head-to-Head in Robotics Amazon and Walmart have long competed on product selection, prices and delivery speeds. Now they’re also competing in robotics. Amazon this week introduced Vulcan, a fulfillment center robot and Amazon’s first robot equipped with a sense of touch. It can handle approximately 75% of warehouse items, including those that are oddly shaped or fragile, and operates up to 20-hour shifts. Walmart is turning to machines that can build. Walmart partnered with Alquist 3D to construct a 5,000-square-foot warehouse extension in Huntsville, Alabama, using robotic 3D printing technology. It was completed in just seven days with a five-person crew.

Amazon will start selling prescriptions for pets. According to a Thursday (May 8) blog post from Amazon, the company said it is partnering with pet pharmacy Vetsource to provide prescription pet medications, adding hundreds of prescription medications to its platform. Shoppers can order them through Vetsource using Amazon’s checkout process, and have Amazon deliver the order. Shoppers will need to add their veterinarian’s information and obtain their approval before the order goes through. “Vetsource manages the dispensing and delivery of veterinarian-prescribed medications to pet parents,” the post said. “Hundreds of the most commonly prescribed medications such as flea and tick preventatives and treatments for chronic conditions will be available and the selection in the U.S. Amazon store will continue to grow. All prescription medications are FDA approved.” Other retailers are entering the pet care space as well. Walmart expanded its pet care offerings in October as more consumers spent more on their pets, widening access to its in-person and virtual veterinary care, grooming services, pet prescription delivery and food supplies. The retail giant said it is expanding its Pet Service Centers by opening new centers in five cities: Cumming and Alpharetta in Georgia, and Chandler, Glendale and Mesa in Arizona. It also launched its Walmart+ benefit with online veterinarian Pawp, giving members of its subscription program free, round-the-clock access to Pawp’s veterinary team. Meanwhile, Uber said in March that it was partnering with Petco to offer home delivery to pet owners, making all Petco locations in the contiguous United States available on Uber Eats for deliveries of pet food, toys, treats and other items. “People are more connected and committed to their pets today than ever before,” Steve Janowiak, Petco’s vice president of digital, said in a news release. “We’re thrilled to partner with Uber Eats and give pet parents another easy way to get the trusted food, treats and supplies they need — right to their door and right when they need it.” PYMNTS Intelligence has found that pet owners can be reluctant to cut back on spending on their pets even when they face financial difficulties. “People are still bringing pets into their family and at increased rates,” Jonathan Wainberg, general manager of Synchrony’s pet business, told PYMNTS in an interview earlier this year. “And they are spending more.” The post Amazon Partners With Pet Pharmacy Vetsource to Sell Pet Medications appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The two mega […] The post How Amazon and Walmart Are Rewiring Retail’s Future With Robotics appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Competition comes best in twos. Think Apple and Microsoft, Coke and Pepsi, McDonald’s and Burger King and many other famous pairings. It’s because a dose of healthy competition ultimately benefits the end consumer, and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the ongoing battle between retail titans Walmart and Amazon. The two mega retailers have evolved far beyond price wars and delivery speed, although those twin pillars remain key goals, and competition today plays out across artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, and omnichannel ecosystems. It can frequently result in new strategies that have the potential to redefine the very fabric of commerce. Robotics Come to Life for Retail Operations Amazon continues to push the boundaries of robotic technology with the introduction on Wednesday (May 7) of Vulcan, a fulfillment center robot and Amazon’s first robot equipped with a sense of touch. It can handle approximately 75% of warehouse items, including those that are oddly shaped or fragile, and operates up to 20-hour shifts, assisting human workers by managing tasks that involve reaching high or low shelves, thereby reducing physical strain on employees. The announcement followed reports from February that Amazon aims to glean savings from its robotics efforts as it increases spending on AI. Amazon has deployed over 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers, including autonomous mobile robots like Proteus and robotic arms such as Robin and Cardinal. These systems are integrated with AI to enhance efficiency and safety in operations And while Amazon is launching robots that can feel, Walmart is turning to machines that can build. In a literally groundbreaking move, Walmart partnered with Alquist 3D to construct a 5,000-square-foot warehouse extension in Huntsville, Alabama, using robotic 3D printing technology. Completed in just seven days with a five-person crew, the project underscores the commitment of large retailers to leveraging automation to address labor shortages and accelerate construction timelines. Retail Footprints Still Matter Both companies are building for the future. In the U.S., Walmart has unveiled its first new Supercenter in Cypress, Texas, after a four-year hiatus — a 170,000-square-foot “Store of the Future” that blends physical retail with digital innovation. This flagship location is part of a broader plan to build or convert over 150 stores and remodel 650 more, integrating features like expanded departments, private pharmacy screening rooms, and enhanced online pickup and delivery services. Also in the U.S, Walmart is reinforcing its dedication to American manufacturing through initiatives like the “Grow with US” program, designed to assist small businesses in navigating the complexities of retail. These efforts align with Walmart’s pledge to invest an additional $350 billion in U.S.-made products by 2030, aiming to bolster domestic supply chains and create job opportunities. The focus on domestic goods also comes against a backdrop where U.S. tariffs are throwing global supply chains into disarray. Looking abroad, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $4 billion investment to establish its first data centers in Chile, marking its third cloud region in Latin America. This expansion aims to support services like generative AI while addressing environmental concerns through innovative cooling technologies and a commitment to renewable energy. Additionally, Amazon’s latest Alexa+ voice assistant has reached 100,000 users, reflecting the company’s commitment to integrating AI into everyday consumer interactions. Innovating Across an Omnichannel Landscape Consumers expect a future where personalized recommendations, seamless transactions, and rapid fulfillment become standard. And as Amazon’s recent partnership involves delivering pet prescriptions, that promise extends even to Fluffy and Fido and other household pets. For both pets and people, data is becoming table stakes for building better experience. For example Sam’s Club, a Walmart subsidiary, is transforming its Member Access Platform (MAP) into a comprehensive “Retail Experience Network.” By introducing tools like Brand Lift, Customer Lifetime Value measurement, and AI-powered Propensity Modeling, Sam’s Club enables brands to create personalized, omnichannel campaigns that resonate with members both online and in-store. Ultimately, in the intensifying battle for retail dominance, Amazon and Walmart are accelerating innovation across the omnichannel frontier, blending digital convenience with physical presence in ways that reshape consumer expectations. Both giants are converging on a future where retail is channel-agnostic, delivery is instantaneous, and the shopping journey is seamlessly personalized. The arms race is less about stores vs. screens — and more about who can turn both into a single, intelligent system.

But Apple is moving quickly to shut the external payments door opened by last week's ruling that the company willfully failed to comply with court orders regarding anticompetitive behavior. In an emergency motion filing late Wednesday (PDF), Apple described US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' \"extraordinary Order\" as including an injunction that \"permanently precludes Apple from exercising control over core aspects of its business operations, including charging for use of its property and protecting the integrity of its platform and in-app purchase mechanism.\" A certificate (PDF) accompanying the emergency filing states that the order \"fundamentally changes Apple's business and creates destabilizing effects\" for App Store customers. The restrictions, \"which will cost Apple substantial sums annually,\" are not based on the company's conduct, Apple claims, but \"were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance\" with the 2021 injunction. In her ruling (PDF), Gonzalez Rogers described Apple as conducting an \"obvious cover-up\" and said that Apple \"at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.\"Read full article Comments",

Amazon has introduced a way to help sellers maintain and optimize product listings. “Enhance My Listing” is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tool designed to let merchants keep their product information current, the eCommerce giant said in a Thursday (May 8) press release provided to PYMNTS. “Selling partners update their listings from time to time to ensure they are relevant, reflective of seasonal trends, and appeal best to buyers,” the company said in a news release. “They’ve told us these updates can sometimes require substantial effort, so we wanted to simplify this process for them.” According to the release, Enhance My Listing integrates with sellers’ existing product tools. The service is powered by Amazon Bedrock, which the company says lets it quickly evolve its generative AI models according to the latest customer activity and engagement. Amazon says it uses those insights to generate “timely, relevant recommendations” for product titles, attributes, descriptions and missing details, saving sellers from needing to do that research. Sellers can review, customize or decline those recommendations at their discretion. “We’ve seen great results and received positive feedback, but we also learned that sellers want to use these capabilities for more than just creating listings; they also want to leverage these tools for their existing listings,” Amazon said. “Our selling partners told us that keeping listings unique and relevant requires adaptation to customer preferences, for example, by adding new attributes, adjusting to retail trends, or updating listings to attract holiday shoppers.” The news comes as Amazon sellers are struggling in the face of U.S. tariffs on imported goods. It’s a struggle facing a lot of smaller companies these days. Close to 20% of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) say they are pessimistic about their chances of remaining open over the next five years, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Brewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs.” Last week saw a report from Reuters that argued that the effort of third-party sellers on platforms such as Amazon to stock up on products to avoid tariff costs will only work for a short amount of time. That’s because consumers are also buying ahead to blunt the impact of tariffs, meaning merchants will eventually sell down their inventory, place new orders and face the challenge of avoiding price increases. Analysts interviewed by Reuters said that it is unlikely merchants can stockpile enough inventory to address their needs for more than six months and that they will experience the full impact of tariffs in the second half of the year.

        "description": "Getty Images; Tyler Le/BITech firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards.Top performers are better incentivized, while underachievers face increased scrutiny.Tech companies are also reducing new-hire offers and lowering pay raises.Big Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat.The latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%.The move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams.These companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent.The changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over.\"The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less,\" Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. \"This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers.\"Google declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: \"Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance.\"The new approach \"creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles,\" an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers \"multiple channels\" for employees to raise concerns about pay.'Appropriate distinction'Amazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance.\"Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase,\" one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. \"This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level.\"At Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling.But with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind.\"High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors,\" John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week.Microsoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls \"low performers.\" Managers also received \"more transparency and clarity\" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year.Meta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a \"non-regrettable attrition\" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers—have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired.Lower pay for new hiresWhile these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers.According to Levels.fyi data, Amazon used to regularly offer over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers in 2022. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing \"extra approvals\" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added.Switching jobs no longer helps either.The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023.Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power.Not everyone is sold that the shift to crackdown on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because \"others are doing them,\" cycling through similar changes every decade or so.\"These are just fads,\" Capelli said.Still, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard.\"No raise, no RSUs — thanks!\" they wrote, referring to the lack of employee stock awards, according to a photo of the writing seen by BI. \"Do more with less.\"Have a tip?

        "description": "Amazon's latest Vulcan robot is the company's first system that can sense touch, enabling it to handle a wider selection of oddly shaped items. Amazon's new Vulcan robot frees up workers to focus their efforts on objects stored in mid-height bins.AmazonAmazon's latest Vulcan robot is the company's first system that can sense touch.The devices can reach places where workers would ordinarily have to bend or climb a step-ladder.Amazon says fulfillment centers will still need human workers, especially for higher-tech roles.Amazon warehouse workers' newest high-tech colleague has a sensitive side.The e-commerce giant's latest robot, named Vulcan, is its first system that can sense touch, enabling it to handle a wider selection of oddly shaped items than older models.\"In the past, when industrial robots have unexpected contact, they either emergency stop or smash through that contact,\" Amazon director of applied science Aaron Parness said in a statement.Vulcan's arm uses force-feedback sensors that allow the robot to detect how much pressure it can apply without damaging an object, and Amazon says the tech enables the robot to pick and stow three quarters of the kinds of products that are kept at a typical fulfillment center.The new robot can handle approximately 75% of the kinds of products at a typical fulfillment center.AmazonThe tech is currently in use at centers in Spokane, Washington, and Hamburg, Germany. Amazon plans to deploy more units across the US and Europe aver the next few years.Apart from its ability to work 20-hour shifts, Amazon also says the Vulcan robot complements human workers by helping reach items from high bins without a step-ladder, and low bins that would require crouching.That frees up workers to focus their efforts on objects stored in mid-height bins, which the company calls their \"power zone.\"Robots operate in a separate area from human workers.Amazon\"Vulcan works alongside our employees, and the combination is better than either on their own,\" Parness said.Parness also told CNBC that Amazon fulfillment centers will still need human workers, especially for higher-tech roles that involve installing and maintaining the expanding robot fleet.\"I don't believe in 100% automation,\" he told the outlet. \"If we had to get Vulcan to do 100% of the stows and picks, it would never happen. You would wait your entire life. Amazon understands this.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Amazon debuted Vulcan, a fulfillment center robot with a sense of touch, according to a Wednesday (May 7) blog post. The average robot is “numb and dumb,” particularly those operating in commercial settings, Aaron Parness, Amazon director of applied science, said in the post. “In the past, when industrial robots have unexpected contact, they either emergency stop or smash through that contact,” he said. “They often don’t even know they have hit something because they cannot sense it.” Vulcan is built using advances in robotics, engineering and physical artificial intelligence to do its job, per the post. While it’s not the first Amazon robot that can pick things up, its sense of touch — that is, its ability to grasp when and how it makes contact with an object — offers new ways for Amazon to bolster its operation-related jobs and facilities, the post said. “Vulcan represents a fundamental leap forward in robotics,” Parness said in the post. “It’s not just seeing the world, it’s feeling it, enabling capabilities that were impossible for Amazon robots until now.” Amazon’s fulfillment centers feature compartments designed to hold up to 10 items. Fitting an item into one of these spaces can be tough for robots that lack human-like dexterity. Vulcan has “a similar kind of finesse,” according to the post. “Vulcan can easily manipulate objects within those compartments to make room for whatever it’s stowing because it knows when it makes contact and how much force it’s applying and can stop short of doing any damage,” the post said. “Vulcan does this using an ‘end of arm tooling’ that resembles a ruler stuck onto a hair straightener, plus force feedback sensors that tell it how hard it’s pushing or how firmly it’s holding something, so it can stay below the point at which it risks doing damage.” The announcement followed reports from February that Amazon aims to glean savings from its robotics efforts as it increases spending on AI. Also in February, PYMNTS spoke with Jenny Shern, general manager at robot builder NexCOBOT, about the challenges of introducing humanoid robots to households. “[I]mplementing humanoid robots into household settings is a more complex advancement because, unlike factories, household environments are highly dynamic, and tasks will vary significantly from one home to another,” Shern said.

According to new data from e-commerce analytics firm SmartScout, discovery-oriented searches like “made in USA products only” have surged 220% year-over-year. Similarly, “made in America products only” is up 130%, while more specific terms like “American flag made in America” have jumped 250%.

        "description": "Epic v. Apple litigation ushers in minor but user-friendly changes. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Apple was in \"willful violation\" of a court injunction that required the company to refrain from \"anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing\" in its tightly controlled iOS App Store. Part of the ongoing litigation between Epic Games and Apple, the injunction specifically forbade Apple from \"denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct purchasers to, other purchasing mechanisms.\" Following the ruling, Apple said it would comply with the court's injunction while the company continued to appeal the decision. The day after the ruling was handed down, Apple altered several of its App Review Guidelines to grant developers permission to do things they hadn't been allowed to do before. As summarized in an email to developers, reported by MacRumors: 3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others. 3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so. 3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront. 3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action. We're already beginning to see new versions of apps that take advantage of these changes. Case in point: Amazon's Kindle app for iPhones and iPads, which from its original launch in 2009 up until yesterday wouldn't actually let anyone buy books in the app. Users instead needed to navigate on their own to Amazon's store in Safari or on their PC and Mac and buy the books they wanted, at which point the books would be available in the Kindle app.Read full article Comments",

Amazon wants a piece of it.According to an internal document obtained by Business Insider, Amazon Web Services is building a new AI coding tool, codenamed Kiro.The software development application taps into AI agents to analyze user prompts and existing data, generating code in \"near real-time,\" the document said.Kiro is a web and desktop app that can be customized to work with first-party and third-party AI agents, Amazon explained in the document. It also taps into knowledge bases, extensions, and themes further enhancing developer productivity.Kiro will feature a multi-modal interface, allowing developers to input not just text but also visual diagrams and other contextual information, the document stated.AWS offers an existing AI coding assistant called Amazon Q. The document obtained by BI suggests that Kiro may be a broader application that taps into multiple AI agents to automate or speed up many aspects of software development.The tool is expected to be able to auto-generate technical design documents, flag potential issues, and offer code optimizations, Amazon explained in its internal document.\"There is an opportunity to reimagine how AI is used to build software at an exponentially faster rate of innovation and higher product quality,\" the company wrote.Amazon disses other AI coding toolsThe internal document critiques existing AI coding tools as being locked into \"code-centric\" interfaces that slow developers down.

It's unclear how this will reshape the role of human coders.Last year, AWS CEO Matt Garman said it's possible that most software developers will not be coding in the future because of new AI tools, and that Amazon has to help employees \"upskill and learn about new technologies\" to boost their productivity, BI previously reported.Amazon faced early hurdles with its Q coding assistant, sparking internal concerns over high costs and lackluster performance compared to rivals like Microsoft's Copilot, BI previously reported. The company's spokesperson said user experience with generative AI is \"constantly evolving\" and pointed to customers, including Deloitte and ADP, that saw productivity gains with Amazon Q.Amazon believes tools like Kiro will simplify common tasks, such as integrating Stripe payments, while empowering developers to do more with less, according to the document.\"With Kiro, developers read less but comprehend more, code less but build more, and review less but release more,\" it said.Have a tip?

Kuiper will directly compete with SpaceX's Starlink, furthering the billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk's decadeslong rivalry.The $10 billion venture aims to bring broadband internet to tens of millions and, if successful, could support some of Amazon's other goals. The project gets its name from the Kuiper Belt, a part of the solar system past the eight major planets. Kuiper has secured launches from various aerospace companies, including Blue Origin, which is owned by Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman.Here's everything to know about Project Kuiper's founding, operations, and competition with Starlink.Project Kuiper's founding and technologyKuiper promises to bring broadband internet access to tens of millions of people, especially those in underserved areas, Amazon says. The company says its services will help close the digital divide, since satellite internet brings faster connections to rural communities.Amazon plans to eventually launch more than 3,200 satellites through Kuiper, which is based out of Washington. Kuiper has three primary components, according to Amazon: infrastructure on the ground, satellites, and customer terminals.Ground infrastructure links the satellite network and the internet. The satellites, which sit in low orbit, transmit data between the ground infrastructure and users. Each user installs an outdoor antenna, or a \"customer terminal,\" that connects to the satellite and delivers WiFi.Kuiper will work with Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business and the base of its profits. The ground services will connect with AWS, meaning Amazon could own all of the infrastructure from the server to the satellite in space and have more control over pricing, quality, and reach.It's not just AWS — Kuiper also has the potential to work with and boost other Amazon services. Alexa, for example, relies on an internet connection. Kuiper could bring the voice assistant to people who currently lack internet. The same goes for bringing the internet to new potential Amazon Prime members and general customers.Timeline and launch plansAmazon began researching Kuiper in 2018, and the Federal Communications Commission gave the company a license to start sending satellites to space in July 2020. Kuiper's initial launch of prototype satellites was scheduled for late 2022 but was delayed when Amazon changed the rocket-delivery system. Eventually, Amazon sent its first two Kuiper prototype satellites into orbit in October of 2023. Those satellites were used to test parts of the Kuiper system before deploying the whole network.On April 28, 2025, Amazon launched 27 satellites and the company said it had established communications with all of them. A rocket from United Launch Alliance, a joint venture Boeing and Lockheed Martin, sent the satellites into space. Amazon said it has secured more than 80 launches with a range of rocket companies in addition to ULA, including Blue Origin, SpaceX, and the French company Arianespace.When it approved Kuiper's plans, the FCC said Amazon needs to deploy at least half of its satellites by the end of July 2026.Kuiper internet will become available to customers before the end of 2025, if launches stay on schedule and all goes to plan.

Tariffs have thrown the global trade order into a new era of fragmentation. On Friday (May 2), Temu stopped shipping products from China directly to the U.S., while just days earlier it was reported that Amazon is looking for steep supplier discounts to offset the impact of Trump’s tariffs. But in a world where international trade is complicated by fluctuating policies, rising costs and unpredictable currency values, one thing is becoming surprisingly clear: simplicity sells. Sophisticated solutions for cross-border trade can help firms mitigate risk, enhance liquidity and maintain competitiveness. More specifically, simplicity in payments is fast becoming a competitive differentiator in global B2B eCommerce, and it’s an area where currency matching is beginning to shine. Typically, buyers in one country pay suppliers in another using dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro, regardless of local currency preferences. This introduces not only foreign exchange risk for suppliers, but also higher processing costs, delays in settlements, and reconciliation headaches. Currency matching, the strategy of settling payments in the supplier’s preferred local currency, can help to remove the friction of foreign exchange fees, rate uncertainty, and opaque pricing. With trade policies in flux and costs climbing, this detail is becoming strategic, particularly as advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, as well as a shift toward virtual cards, are helping to build a more streamlined, simplified and cost effective cross-border B2B ecosystem. Read also: Trump’s Global Tariffs Position CFOs as New Supply Chain Architects Currency Matching Brings Simplicity Currency volatility, a perennial concern in international trade, has become more pronounced in the current geopolitical climate. This shift has forced multinational corporations and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to reassess their sourcing strategies, often leading to a reevaluation of supplier networks and an increase in transactions across a broader array of markets and currencies. Nearly 1 in 5 SMBs are pessimistic about their odds of survival over the next five years, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Brewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs.” As businesses diversify their trade relationships to circumvent tariff barriers, they can encounter a corresponding rise in foreign exchange (FX) exposure and settlement challenges. Currency matching flips this dynamic. The practice aligns receivables and payables in the same currency to reduce the need for FX conversions. When done effectively, it allows companies to naturally hedge their currency exposures by matching inflows and outflows, avoiding the need to enter the FX market. More importantly, it can simplify the relationship between buyers and suppliers. “When you have volatility in the values of currencies it adds to what is ‘necessary’ to carry out successful cross-border payments and an overall payment strategy,” Rob Seidman, head of U.S. Bank’s Avvance, told PYMNTS. “The holy grail is a frictionless experience.” Traditionally, this has been a manual and time-consuming process, especially for firms with fragmented ERP systems and decentralized treasury operations. However, recent advances in AI, machine learning and real-time data analytics are changing that by powering currency matching platforms that can identify and execute optimal matching strategies across multiple entities and geographies. There are also advances in blockchain-based solutions, such as stablecoins, for firms to consider when it comes to optimizing their cross-border payment processes. These transactions take place on different blockchains and can help to mitigate, or even avoid entirely, traditional FX risk. On Monday (May 5), a Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft was introduced into Congress, representing a bill which could establish a productive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and other digital asset payment mechanisms. Read also: What Pinball Tells Us About Spending in the Post-Tariff World An Imperative in an Uncertain World Transparency is in short supply. That can make it more valuable than ever for businesses transacting across borders. Currency matching is no longer a back-office function. It’s becoming a lever for CFOs to drive value by embracing tools that not only automate currency matching but also provide visibility into global cash positions, forecasted exposures, and risk-adjusted strategies. And as B2B transactions become more digitized, particularly on eCommerce platforms, this kind of transparency isn’t just nice to have — it’s essential. Business buyers now expect the same smooth, intuitive experience they get as consumers. That includes visibility into pricing, fees and timelines. Automation, meanwhile, takes the grunt work out of managing cross-border payments. Reconciliation, auditing, tax documentation and compliance checks are handled by algorithms. This reduces the administrative load on finance teams and lowers the barrier to global trade for smaller businesses. Another development reshaping B2B payments is the rise of virtual cards — secure, one-time-use payment methods that offer greater control and lower fraud risk. When integrated with currency matching, virtual cards enable instant, compliant and traceable payments across borders. While virtual cards have long been used in travel and expense management, they’re now entering B2B eCommerce with force. Companies can issue cards in a supplier’s local currency, tie them to specific invoices, and set spending rules — all from a centralized dashboard.

        "description": "Amazon is investing heavily in rural last-mile delivery as a hedge against Walmart, a prominent analyst says. The post Analyst: Amazon’s $4B rural delivery investment aimed at slowing Walmart appeared first on FreightWaves. Amazon’s plan to invest more than $4 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its rural parcel delivery network and enable faster delivery to small towns across the United States is a preemptive move against Walmart, according to a leading parcel analyst. “They are doing this in response to Walmart. Walmart is catching up with them [in e-commerce] and building its own network of delivery drivers using the Uber and Lyft concept of independent gig drivers” who use an app to accept packages, said Satish Jindel, founder and president of ShipMatrix, a parcel management, consulting and analytics firm, in a phone interview. Amazon and Walmart in recent years have become significant rivals to FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service in the parcel shipping sector. Amazon, Walmart and other retailers will capture most of the growth in the domestic parcel market, according to a recent ShipMatrix report. Walmart’s ability to fulfill orders from its stores and clubs has been a key driver of its e-commerce growth, CEO Doug McMillon said during an investor town hall last month. The retailer’s coverage of U.S. households with same-day delivery has grown by 22% during the past two years. The company can now provide same-day delivery to 93% of U.S. residences, up from 76% of households two years ago, he said. “Walmart is not as prevalent in rural areas. Amazon wants to make sure that Walmart doesn’t get there with some other way. In rural areas, Walmart may be willing to pay people $15 per hour instead of $10 because it’s greater distance from the store. They [Amazon] want to preempt Walmart from penetrating their business where they have created a huge market advantage. Right now, they’re delivering 280 packages with 180 stops per van trip in most of the country. That’s cheaper than UPS, FedEx or even the post office.” The retailer also has the advantage of only participating in the business-to-consumer market, meaning its network is unidirectional since no pickups are required. Amazon announced the rural delivery expansion last week. The capital expenditures will pay for more than 200 delivery stations, tripling the size of the rural delivery network and cutting delivery times in half for Prime members in less populated areas, said Udit Maden, senior vice president for Amazon Worldwide Operations, in a blog post. By locating more small distribution centers close to customers, Amazon will be able to deliver more than 1 billion additional packages each year to customers in remote areas of the country. With the upgrades, Amazon’s last-mile delivery network will cover an additional 1.2 million square miles, equivalent to the area of Alaska, California and Texas, combined. “At a time where many logistics providers are backing away from serving rural customers because of the cost to serve, we are stepping up our investment to make their lives easier and better,” Maden wrote. Amazon opened its first rural delivery station in 2020 and began ramping up the small-town delivery network in 2023 as the company switched to a regional and local distribution model. Maden said the effort has already improved delivery speeds by 50% on average. Other large parcel carriers are cutting back on rural service. In 2023, UPS began a deferred delivery program that combines deliveries in some rural areas to keep prices down and improve efficiency because the cost of providing service is higher than in densely populated areas. The company said at the time that shipments in certain ZIP codes will spend an extra day in transit, but that less than 1% of shipments are impacted. Rival FedEx scaled back Sunday home delivery in some outlying areas in 2022. And the U.S. Postal Service on April 1 began reducing the number of truck trips and mail collections at most postal facilities farther than 50 miles from a processing plant to eliminate inefficient truck runs, adding a day to delivery times for mail originating from remote post offices and ZIP codes. “The expansion enables Amazon to deliver nationwide one-day delivery at a very low cost, which would be very difficult for UPS/FedEx to compete with, using existing networks,” Morgan Stanley transportation analyst Ravi Shanker said in a client note. In addition to raising expansion hurdles for Walmart’s delivery network, Amazon sees more opportunity to control the rural delivery market after UPS insourced SurePost, its most economical shipping product, over Postal Service price hikes for last-mile delivery and because Postal Service changes could soon increase delivery prices for rural areas, Jindel told FreightWaves. Amazon said the rural delivery expansion will create over 100,000 part-time and full-time jobs and driver opportunities. Amazon uses a mix of third-party delivery providers. The Delivery Service Partner program has set up more than 4,000 owner-operators with small van fleets to make package deliveries in defined territories. A relatively small number of drivers make deliveries with their own vehicles under the Amazon Flex program. And existing small businesses can sign up to do deliveries in their communities under the Hub Delivery program. Amazon could scale up the use of gig drivers under Flex to support more rural deliveries, said Jindel. A $139 Prime membership includes free shipping on eligible items; one-day, two-day and same-day delivery in select areas; pricing deals; and the Amazon video and music streaming services.

        "description": "Austin has been on a building boom since it started becoming a tech hub. The Texas city has seen its skyline shift and its fortunes grow. Major tech firms like Apple and Amazon have established key offices, and in the 2010s alone, the city grew 21%, adding 171,000 residents. It now has more than 974,000, the 10th largest in the country. Builders have raced to erect housing for these new arrivals; Austin has seen a boom in market rate apartments in recent years—so much that it led rents to decrease after years of big jumps. And in recent years, according to a new report, part of that building boom has included affordable housing, including permanent housing for the formerly unhoused, low-cost studio units, and even housing for teachers. Austin’s affordable housing construction pipeline outpaces all other U.S. cities, according to research from Yardi Matrix, a real estate data source. In 2024, the city delivered 4,605 affordable units—defined as properties that agree to limit rents as a condition of a tax credit or subsidy. That’s double the rate in 2023. The research shows Austin will also deliver the most affordable units this year, 3,452—more than LA’s 2,752, despite the California city having more than four times as many people. And Austin will continue to lead, with the forecast of units in the pipeline through 2027 showing Austin with 9,528, compared to Seattle’s 6,289. [Chart: Yardi Matrix] “We want to ensure that the population that made Austin what Austin is can stay in Austin,” said James May, Housing and Community Development Officer for the City of Austin Housing Department. It’s also worth mentioning that Austin’s changing demographics are playing a large role in the housing market. As the city continues to morph from a capital and college town to a tech and healthcare nexus, wealth and median income have risen. A recent city memo noted that the city’s housing market had dramatically changed since it laid out its housing plan in the mid 2010s—median home sale price has risen by 58%, and rents went from an average of $1,350 in 2017 to a peak of $1,709 in 2022—so Austin needs to recalibrate its strategy and focus more on deeply affordable units. “Austin used to be a city of musicians and artists, and now income and rent are far higher than what it was 10 years ago,” said Heather Way, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin who specializes in housing law. [Chart: Yardi Matrix] May credited the growth in affordable housing in Austin to three factors. First, was community: Multiple providers including the city, county, housing authority, and private builders have been looking to invest in new housing, with private developers investing in significant new construction using the city’s density-bonus program. The second was money. A series of local bonds for affordable housing raised significant funds for new construction, including a 2022 bond for $350 million, which helped fund new affordable units. In addition, the construction of new transit lines included $300 million in anti-displacement funds that also helped pay for new buildings. May said the city recently purchased a 100-acre property formerly owned by the Top Deal electronic company that it plans to use for mixed-income development, which will include affordable housing. And finally, the third pillar was regulatory reform. The city council has passed many initiatives in recent years to increase density and make it easier to build: transit-oriented development rules allowed for higher buildings near bus and train lines, Affordability Unlocked allowed housing development on land zoned for commercial projects, and the HOME Initiative shrunk the required lot size for homes and made it legal to build multiple units on lots zoned for single-family homes. But even with that surge, it’s still not enough. Despite Austin’s recent lead, the construction rate still lags well behind what’s actually needed to provide sufficient access to affordable housing: tens of thousands of new units would be needed to adequately meet the demand. A record-breaking number of evictions in the surrounding county last year attest to the pressure renters feel making ends meet. And while new supply is definitely a step in the right direction, what isn’t being built is deeply affordable housing. Defined as housing that can support those making around 30% of the median income; in 2023, just 63 such units were built, even though this group makes up 17% of the city’s population. Creating enough affordable units, and building more for those with extremely low incomes, will be even more challenging due to the changing landscape for construction. Stubbornly high interest rates will make getting financing more difficult. Tariffs will make materials more expensive. And the Trump administration’s actions against HUD, including threats to withhold funding from sanctuary cities like Austin, might end vital federal support. “It’s going to be a tough market, we won’t see the entire pipeline go all the way through,” May said. Austin’s boost in housing production is a start. But it’s sadly far from finished.",

The first production satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network launched earlier this week, but if you tuned in to the mission's official livestream, the truncated coverage had the feel of a spy satellite launch. This changed with a video Amazon posted on social media Friday, giving space enthusiasts and prospective Kuiper customers their first look at the real satellites. The 40-second clip shows the Kuiper satellites separating from their launch vehicle in the blackness of space following liftoff Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Since Amazon unveiled Project Kuiper in 2019, officials at the retail giant have been shy about showing even the most basic imagery of their satellites. Images released by Amazon previously provided glimpses inside the company's satellite factory near Seattle, along with views of the shipping containers Amazon uses to transport spacecraft from Washington their launch base in Florida.Read full article Comments",

Amazon has rolled out Alexa+, the new version of its voice assistant, to more than 100,000 users so far, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday (May 1) during the company’s quarterly earnings call. Alexa+ will be made available to more users in the coming months, Jassy said. It is now starting to roll out in the U.S. and will be expanded to other countries later this year. The new version of the voice assistant is being made available on an Early Access basis, beginning with customers who sign up to be notified and own an Echo Show 8, 10, 15 or 21 and then expanding to more Echo customers over time, according to the Amazon website. “People are really liking Alexa+ thus far,” Jassy said during the call. The new voice assistant is free to Prime members and available for $19.99 per month to non-members, Jassy said. He added that Amazon has more than half a billion devices in people’s homes, offices and cars to which Alexa+ will be able to be delivered. Jassy said during that call that the new version is “meaningfully smarter and more capable than its prior self, can both answer virtually any questions and take actions.” He added that users no longer have to say “Alexa” before requesting every action; instead, they only have to say it once and can then have an ongoing conversation with the voice assistant. “And then I think it’s just experience in trying thing,” Jassy said during the call. “So, you can do things like: you have guests coming over on a Saturday night for dinner and you can say, ‘Alexa, please open the shades, put the lights on in the driveway and on the porch, increase the temperature five degrees and pick music that would be great for dinner that’s mellow, and she just does it. When you have those types of experiences, it makes you want to do more of it.” When Amazon introduced Alexa+ in February, the company said the new voice assistant would start rolling out in the next few weeks in the U.S. and works with nearly all existing Alexa devices. Alexa+ had been plagued by delays, reportedly due to it hallucinating or giving wrong information on test questions. The unveiling came about a year and a half after Amazon first announced it was going to infuse AI into Alexa following the release of ChatGPT. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “How Consumers Want to Live in the Voice Economy” found that 54% of consumers said they would prefer voice technology in the future because it is faster than typing or using a touchscreen.

The efforts of third-party sellers on platforms like Amazon to stock up on goods to avoid the cost of tariffs will reportedly work for only a limited time. Because shoppers are also buying ahead to avoid the impact of tariffs, merchants will eventually sell down their inventory, place new orders, and be faced with the challenge of trying to avoid price increases, Reuters reported Friday (May 2). Analysts interviewed by Reuters said that it is unlikely sellers can stock up on enough inventory to meet their needs for more than six months and that they will feel the full impact of tariffs in the third or fourth quarter. As PYMNTS reported Thursday (May 1), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s quarterly earnings call that demand had not yet softened because of tariffs and that if anything, the company had seen “heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” Amazon pulled forward inventory in the first quarter, while many marketplace merchants accelerated shipments to U.S. warehouses to insulate customers from price spikes. Jassy added that Amazon’s risk is muted relative to rivals because many traditional retailers buy from middlemen who themselves import from China, “so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China-direct sellers” on Amazon’s platform. Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said during a February earnings call that Walmart feels good about navigating tariffs and other uncertainties. Rainey said Walmart’s playbook includes negotiating with suppliers, expanding private-label offerings and shifting sourcing to lower-cost regions. “We can then pass on [savings] to consumers,” he said during the call. It was reported Tuesday (April 29) that retailer CEOs who met with President Donald Trump warned that while their companies have kept prices low despite tariffs, the situation can’t last. They said it would be tough to avoid higher prices and some products could become scarce if retailers choose not to sell them due to tariff costs. Nearly one in five small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are pessimistic about their odds of survival over the next five years, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Brewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs.” The post Marketplaces’ Third-Party Sellers to Face Full Impact of Tariffs in Second Half appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Meta mentioned \"Trump\" just once in a press release from April 11.Big Tech executives have aligned themselves closer to Trump since he won the election. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the election, and Google donated $1 million to the inauguration fund. Apple CEO Tim Cook did the same.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also donated to the fund. On a podcast this week, Zuckerberg said, \"Our default as an American company should be to try to have a productive relationship with whoever is running the government.\"The absence of direct mentions of Trump is perhaps surprising given the disruption the president's trade policy has caused American businesses.Trump has said his goal in enacting broad tariffs is to rectify an \"imbalance\" that has \"fueled a large and persistent trade deficit in both industrial and agricultural goods,\" according to the White House.The tariffs have forced companies, especially ones that sell consumer goods, to rethink their strategies. During the ongoing 90-day pause on the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Trump issued in April, some companies have begun diverting inventory closer to their US markets and looking for alternatives to manufacturing in China, which has taken the brunt of the tariffs.While Big Tech avoided talking about Trump, they did have plenty to say about tariffs this quarter. Last quarter, tariffs only came up a handful of times.Amazon and Apple, the two biggest sellers of consumer goods, made up the bulk of Big Tech's tariff talk during the recent earnings calls. Amazon mentioned tariffs 16 times in its earnings call on Thursday. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that \"Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs\" and expressed some optimism that the company could still keep prices low.Apple, meanwhile, mentioned tariffs 26 times on its earnings call. Cook said the company \"had a limited impact from tariffs\" and was able to \"optimize our supply chain and inventory\" for the past quarter. He said he expects tariffs to add about $900 million to its costs this quarter — provided that the administration makes no further changes.Apple is also diverting iPhone production from China to India to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Cook said the company expects \"the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin\" in the June quarter.Microsoft CFO Amy Hood mentioned tariffs once on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Discussing Microsoft's personal computing revenue, which came in at $13.4 billion, she said, \"Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as tariffs uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated.\"Times have changed since this time last year, when Trump and his economic policies were out of sight and out of mind.Read the original article on Business Insider Big Tech had little to say about Trump during their earnings calls this week.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesTech giants didn't have much to say about Trump during earnings calls this week.The president's tariffs, however, came up a lot.Amazon and Apple discussed tariffs the most, mentioning them 42 times collectively.Big Tech had little to say about President Donald Trump during their earnings calls this week.Neither Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, nor Snap mentioned the president at all, according to a review of transcripts from Q2 earnings calls by AlphaSense, a market intelligence company.

        "description": "For one exhilarating moment, it sounded like Amazon was about to make a gutsy pro-consumer move. On Tuesday, Punchbowl News reported that the company would “soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product” by specifying it “right next to the product’s total listed price.” That act of transparency would have been reminiscent of past precedent-shattering Amazon initiatives such as its 1995 introduction of user-written reviews—including ones so stinging as to drive customers away from a product. And then Trump 2.0 reality set in. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attacked the idea of tariff disclosure as “hostile and political,” another confirmation that Trump’s oft-expressed contention that American consumers wouldn’t bear the cost of higher tariffs never jibed with basic economics. An Amazon spokesperson claimed the notion had been under consideration only for the company’s Temu-like Amazon Haul bargain store and was “not going to happen.” Trump himself chimed in to say he had called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who “solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing.” To be fair, it’s unlikely that Amazon could have introduced anything like a universal tariff line item for the 600 million-plus products in its online store. It only designs a few devices itself, giving it the requisite intimate knowledge of their supply chain. Mostly, the company is a reseller, and more than half of the transactions on its site are third-party sales it facilitates for other merchants. It surely doesn’t know how much tariffs added to the cost of every random HDTV it sells—and if it did, presidential whim might change the math from day to day. Still, even if Amazon breaking out tariffs at the point of purchase turned out to be a fleeting fantasy, it was an instructive mental exercise—maybe even a powerful idea that’s tough to unimagine once you’ve thought about it. Why should anyone care about the percentage of an item’s price represented by tariffs—a form of taxation most of us have cheerfully ignored until recently, even though it has a 236-year history in the U.S.? First of all, a reliable accounting would counter misinformation spread by the president. He’s backpedaled some on his past stance that tariffs only burden manufacturers in other countries. However, absent dramatic developments such as iPhones suddenly going for $2,000, it may be tough to tell exactly what his increases are doing to our purchasing power. Explaining it on an item-by-item basis would help. But the impact of tariffs on my own wallet is just one reason why I crave hard facts. Trump’s interpretation of global trade—that China is ripping off the U.S. because we buy more stuff from it than it buys from us—is plainly ridiculous. His attempt to use tariffs to spark a renaissance in American manufacturing is already backfiring, given that factories here need parts produced elsewhere, and other countries are retaliating with stiffer tariffs on U.S. products. (Fun fact: A Corning plant in Harrrodsburg, Kentucky, exports the Gorilla Glass pervasive in phones and other devices.) All of this, I already know. Yet except for a few high-profile items like the iPhone—whose production Apple may ramp up in India to avoid tariffs on Chinese imports—I don’t claim to understand much about the endlessly complex tales behind the products I buy. The tariff backstory for individual purchases we’re considering making is arguably a more valuable data point than a superficial, potentially misleading “Made in the U.S.A.” or “Made in China” label. It would be a visceral reminder of how fundamentally connected the world economy is. Globalists and isolationists alike would get something out of it. It’s not just tariffs. The more I ponder the situation, the less informed I feel as a consumer. I tend to take the Nutrition Facts information box on packaged foods for granted and rarely dig any deeper than the figures on calories and fat. But it’s hard to imagine life without that box. When I refreshed my memory about its history, I was startled to learn it came into existence only a little over 30 years ago, mandated by a 1990 bill signed by President George H. W. Bush. Before that, food makers got to choose what they disclosed—or didn’t—about the products they sold. An equivalent box for other goods would make us all smarter. There’s plenty of fodder beyond tariffs: other taxes, product recalls, warranty information, carbon footprint, and on and on. In the unlikely event that a Nutrition Facts for Everything bill passes Trump’s desk, he’s not going to sign it, so I’m filing the idea away for future reference. In the meantime, I hope there are merchants out there willing to post tariff numbers, at least for certain products. Countless companies have spent this entire century trying to keep up with Amazon, often by copying its innovations. Here’s a rare chance for them to gain an edge on the e-commerce behemoth by going where it won’t.

There, he saw how new AI technologies could be hugely useful to automate the brands' rote administrative tasks — and, soon, could be revolutionary for clinical care.\"While I was at Amazon, there was early proof of concept that AI agents were going to be very effective for healthcare minutiae, which the industry is drowning in,\" he said. \"I came to Ascertain with that thesis, and we retooled the company around it.\"Ascertain launched its AI agent platform as a copilot for case managers, who are typically nurses who coordinate patient care, payments, and hospital discharges.Ascertain is one of many startups gaining ground to tackle healthcare administrative tasks with AI.

Northwell Health treats about 2 million patients every year, more than any other New York health system, volumes that would leave any hospital overrun with administrative tasks.\"It's almost impossible to solve these problems at a large health system like Northwell without a really intimate partnership early on,\" Michalski said.He said Ascertain's focus on case managers also sets the startup apart. \"For the life of me, I can't understand why people are not looking at case managers. They are the nexus of so many things — denial rates, length of stay, patient satisfaction,\" he said.Ascertain's next phase of customers will come from its Series A lead investor, Deerfield Management, where Michalski will now also serve as Chief Information Officer. Deerfield's portfolio includes a number of healthcare delivery companies that Ascertain will soon sell into, Michalski said.Dr. Julian Harris, an operating partner at Deerfield, said he sees lots of opportunities for Ascertain to enhance the firm's portfolio companies' workflows, as well as to connect with the hospitals and health systems that Deerfield has previously partnered with, co-invested with, or that are limited partners in Deerfield's fund.Deerfield also has relationships with health plans, Harris said, which could help Ascertain expand into payer contracts in the long term. \"But out of the gate, the health system opportunities are massive,\" he said.Here's the 10-slide pitch deck Ascertain used to bank $10 million from Deerfield.AscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainRead the original article on Business Insider Ascertain CEO Mark Michalski.AscertainAscertain raised a $10 million Series A round to ease healthcare administrative burdens with AI.Ascertain's CEO, formerly on Amazon's life sciences team, is bringing AI agents to health systems.It now has more deals on the horizon with private equity firm Deerfield Management.Ascertain CEO Dr. Mark Michalski, a radiologist by training, loved practicing medicine.

Northwell Health treats about 2 million patients every year, more than any other New York health system, volumes that would leave any hospital overrun with administrative tasks.\"It's almost impossible to solve these problems at a large health system like Northwell without a really intimate partnership early on,\" Michalski said.He said Ascertain's focus on case managers also sets the startup apart. \"For the life of me, I can't understand why people are not looking at case managers. They are the nexus of so many things — denial rates, length of stay, patient satisfaction,\" he said.Ascertain's next phase of customers will come from its Series A lead investor, Deerfield Management, where Michalski will now also serve as Chief Information Officer. Deerfield's portfolio includes a number of healthcare delivery companies that Ascertain will soon sell into, Michalski said.Dr. Julian Harris, an operating partner at Deerfield, said he sees lots of opportunities for Ascertain to enhance the firm's portfolio companies' workflows, as well as to connect with the hospitals and health systems that Deerfield has previously partnered with, co-invested with, or that are limited partners in Deerfield's fund.Deerfield also has relationships with health plans, Harris said, which could help Ascertain expand into payer contracts in the long term. \"But out of the gate, the health system opportunities are massive,\" he said.Here's the 10-slide pitch deck Ascertain used to bank $10 million from Deerfield.AscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainAscertainRead the original article on Business Insider",

Amazon’s ads business is proof, cruising steadily while the broader market sputters in the face of economic drag. That strain has already forced ad spend forecasts down as CMOs scramble to rework budgets and reallocate dollars in the thick of the turbulence. Unsurprisingly, more of that money is ending up in Amazon’s cart, where ads are close to the point of purchase – easier to justify, harder to cut. Over the last quarter, it raked in $13.92 billion, a 19% rise on the same period a year ago, according to its latest earnings update. Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Amazon Lays Out Its 2025 Road Map appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Most earnings announcements and ensuing analyst calls are spent discussing all the money — or lack of it — the host company made during the previous quarter. Not so at Amazon on Thursday (May 1). It spent most of its first-quarter earnings call talking less about the dollars it made and more about how it intends to keep winning the battle for the consumer’s trust. It sounded its traditional theme of the customer experience early and often. So far, anyway, that customer is proving to be fairly resilient. By the numbers, revenue rose 10% from a year earlier to $155.7 billion, with worldwide paid units up 8%, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts. Still, executives struck a cautious note about spending patterns. Deal events such as the Big Spring Sale and Ramadan promotions “helped customers save over $500 million,” CEO Andy Jassy said, adding that price sensitivity is elevated “with this being an uncertain moment for consumers.” Everyday Essentials — groceries, household staples and the like — grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the mix and now make up 1 of every 3 U.S. units sold, a sign that shoppers remain value-focused even as they keep clicking “buy.” For the current quarter, Amazon forecasts net sales of $159 billion to $164 billion and operating income of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, a bounce of between 7% and 11%. The wide range, Olsavsky noted, “reflects the complex external environment,” including tariffs and a seasonal jump in stock-based compensation. Pressed repeatedly on the potential for higher tariffs, Jassy said demand had not yet softened. If anything, he said, Amazon has seen “heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” The company pulled forward inventory in the first quarter, while many marketplace merchants accelerated shipments to U.S. warehouses, a tactic aimed at insulating customers from price spikes. Amazon’s risk, he argued, is muted relative to rivals. Many traditional retailers buy from middlemen who themselves import from China, “so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China-direct sellers” on Amazon’s platform, Jassy said. With more than 2 million global sellers and “hundreds of millions of unique SKUs,” Jassy expects that breadth to cushion any sudden shifts in sourcing or consumer tastes. “When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most,” he said. Logistics and Agentic Infrastructure Behind the scenes, Amazon is pushing through the next wave of efficiency projects that helped power its recent margin rebound. Rearchitecting the inbound freight network to align with the regional fulfillment model “drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network,” Olsavsky said, allowing record one-day and same-day delivery volumes while holding down per-package costs. Excluding one-time charges tied to returned merchandise and early tariff buys, first-quarter operating margins would have been 7.2% in North America and 3.7% internationally. Looking ahead, Amazon will “build out same-day delivery sites, expand our rural delivery network, and add robotics and automation,” Olsavsky said, noting that the investments designed to protect profitability even if consumer demand slows. Much of the call’s second half shifted from logistics to artificial intelligence. Jassy called the technology a once-in-a-generation platform shift and said Amazon Web Services already commands a “multibillion-dollar annual revenue run rate” in generative AI services, growing triple-digit percentages despite capacity constraints. To satisfy developers, AWS has layered its Bedrock service with models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and Amazon’s in-house Titan family, positioning the cloud division as what Jassy called the “infrastructure for agentic AI.” The most visible proof point is Alexa. A new version, free to Prime members or $19.99 a month for others, is rolling out to more than half a billion installed devices. Unlike earlier voice assistants that merely answered questions, the upgraded Alexa can orchestrate complex routines, Jassy said. “You can say, ‘Open the shades, raise the temperature five degrees and pick dinner music,’ and she just does it. … It really is like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don’t have.” Early user feedback, he added, has been “very positive.” Amazon’s playbook for 2024 looks familiar: lean harder into price, speed and selection while pouring capital into technologies — particularly AI — that can widen those same moats. Whether tariffs tighten or the consumer softens, executives argue that the company’s diversified supplier base, sprawling fulfillment network and fast-growing advertising and cloud franchises give it unusual flexibility. As Jassy summed up, “We have emerged from past periods of uncertainty with more relative market segment share than we started — and I’m optimistic this could happen again.” The post Customer First, Agentic AI Next.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said Thursday (May 1) that the company needs “more time” to upgrade Siri’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, as the AI assistant faces criticisms that it lags behind rivals such as Amazon’s Alexa and other voice-enabled AI chatbots. “We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar,” Cook said during Apple’s earnings call with analysts. “We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands.” When pressed by an analyst to specify reasons for the delay, Cook said that “There’s not a lot of other reasons. … It’s just taking a bit longer than we thought.” Apple had faced criticism about the progress of Apple Intelligence — Apple’s AI initiative — which experienced snafus, including hallucinating news alert items. Siri, in particular, was criticized for lagging behind competing chatbots, despite being a pioneer as the first AI assistant embedded in a smartphone. Siri co-designer Luc Julia has told PYMNTS that Apple’s obsession with perfection likely hindered Siri’s progress. Generative AI is famously hard to completely control because it hallucinates, said Julia, who is also the chief scientific officer of Renault. However, Cook said that consumers appreciate Apple Intelligence. In the markets where the company launched the AI system, sales of the iPhone 16 family of smartphones were stronger year over year compared to markets that did not have Apple Intelligence, he said. During the earnings call for its fiscal 2025 second quarter ended March 29, 2025, several analysts asked about the impact of tariffs to Apple’s top and bottom lines. Cook said that Apple expects to see a $900 million increase in costs due to tariffs for its fiscal third quarter based on the current tariff policy. “We estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our cost,” Cook said. Cook said India is now the source of “most” iPhones sold in the U.S. He also said that “almost all” of Apple’s iPads, Macs and Apple Watches sold into the U.S. are sourced from Vietnam. As for sales to the rest of the world, those Apple products would be sourced from China, Cook said. The CEO also said Apple had been diversifying parts of its supply chain to mitigate the risk from relying too much on one country. Cook said he expects to continue this policy. Shares of Apple fell 4% to $204.86 in after-hours trading. Read more: Apple Aims to Mitigate Tariffs by Sourcing All US-Bound iPhones From India Legal Headaches A day earlier, a federal judge rebuked Apple, saying the company is in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games lawsuit. The court had previously ordered Apple to let users pay App Store developers directly through a third-party link to avoid the 30% commission Apple charges developers. Instead, the judge said, Apple assessed a 27% commission to app developers for external sales. Apple also put up pop-up screens warning consumers that paying outside the App Store might not be secure. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers then ordered Apple to stop collecting commissions outside the App Store and stop sending these messages to consumers. The judge also asked the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of California to investigate Apple for criminal contempt. Cook said he disagreed with the judge’s ruling. “We’ve complied with the court’s order and we’re going to appeal.” However, Cook declined to comment on the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google for its search monopoly, which would have a big impact on Apple’s services business. Google pays Apple a reported $20 billion a year to be Safari’s default search engine across iPhones, iPads and Macs. Separately, Apple is also facing its own antitrust lawsuit, brought about by the Justice Department in March 2024, saying that it allegedly used its smartphone monopoly power to improve restrictive contractual terms on developers and withholding critical access points. Meanwhile, the EU fined Apple and Meta last month for violating its Digital Markets Act. Apple allegedly prevented developers from giving consumers other options to pay for apps besides through the App Store. By the Numbers In the quarter, Apple earned $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share and up 8% from a year ago, on revenue of $95.4 billion, up 5%. Wall Street analysts expected Apple to earn $1.62 per share on $94.4 billion in revenue for the just concluded quarter, according to FactSet. IPhone revenue was up 2% to $46.8 billion in the quarter, while Mac revenue rose 7% to $7.9 billion. IPad sales were up 15% to $6.4 billion. Wearables, home and accessories revenue fell 5% to $7.5 billion. In the like quarter year ago, Apple reported net income of $23.6 billion, or $1.53 per share, on revenue of $90.75 billion.

        "description": "Amazon officials said on Thursday tariffs are creating uncertainty for global online retailers. The post Amazon beats earnings expectations, sees market uncertainty ahead appeared first on FreightWaves. Amazon officials said on Thursday global tariffs loom over potential profits in upcoming quarters. The e-commerce and cloud services giant reported first-quarter revenue of $155.67 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. First-quarter earnings per share increased 64% year over year to $1.59. First-quarter revenue and EPS beat Wall Street expectations of $155.04 billion and $1.36. “It’s hard to tell what’s going to happen with tariffs right now,” CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts after the market closed. “It’s hard to tell where they’re going to settle and when they’re going to settle.” Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) guidance for the second quarter reflects uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariff war with China and other nations, Jassy said. Company officials’ guidance for the second quarter anticipates $159 billion to $164 billion in sales and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in operating income. Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter called for $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit. Amazon’s business is divided into several key segments: North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Jassy said the company did not see a decline in traffic from shoppers on the e-commerce platform during the first quarter. “We haven’t seen any attenuation of demand yet,” Jassy said. “To some extent, we’ve seen some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” He said sellers who use Amazon’s platform haven’t raised prices on their products significantly yet either. For its online shopping business, Amazon reported quarterly revenue of $57 billion, up 5% year over year from the same period in 2024. “We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet,” Jassy said. “Some of this reflects some forward buying we did in our first-party selling. Some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third-party sellers have done. But a fair amount of this is that most sellers just haven’t changed pricing yet. Again, this could change depending on where tariffs settle.” The company’s North American sales segment increased 8% year over year to $92.9 billion. International segment sales increased 5% year over year to $33.5 billion. Amazon became the target of the Trump administration’s outrage on Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the retailer’s reported plans to display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only considered adding those tariff items to its site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump reportedly called Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases, Forbes reported.

The new Saks on Amazon storefront offers the curated shopping experience and luxury fashion and beauty items associated with Saks Fifth Avenue together with the convenience and fast shipping offered by Amazon, Amazon said in a Thursday (May 1) blog post. This new offering is the latest addition to the Luxury Stores that Amazon launched in 2020, according to the post. “Customers can also browse the launch assortment through digital window displays available in the Saks on Amazon experience,” the post said. “Inspired by the iconic windows at the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship, these digital displays allow customers to ‘window shop’ the Saks on Amazon storefront, with the added convenience of instantly adding items to their cart.” Amazon and Saks launched the new luxury storefront on Tuesday (April 29), saying that it will enhance access to luxury fashion and beauty. The storefront will feature product arrays that are regularly refreshed to offer new and trending products, the companies said in a Tuesday press release. “This collaboration underscores Saks Fifth Avenue’s reputation as a leader in luxury curation, as well as our commitment to reinventing luxury shopping so that each customer’s experience is unmistakably their own,” Saks Global President and Chief Commercial Officer Emily Essner said in the release. Jenny Freshwater, vice president of Amazon Fashion, Fitness and Creators, said in the release: “This collaboration with Saks furthers Amazon’s commitment to supporting the luxury industry and increasing our assortment for customers, while maintaining an elevated shopping experience that meets the varying tastes of our diverse customer base.” It was reported in July that Amazon was taking a minority stake in Saks Global, the new company that would be created when Saks Fifth Avenue parent company HBC bought rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus. Shortly after the acquisition was announced, Marc Metrick, who was CEO of Saks’ online operations at the time and later become the CEO of Saks Global, said Amazon’s tech would help the luxury retailers thrive. “How do you future-proof a brand like Saks or Neimans or Bergdorf? You do that through technology,” Metrick said. For Amazon, the minority stake in Saks Global may provide “a ringside seat into the ins and outs of a retail category where Amazon doesn’t have much of a presence right now — but could over the next five years,” PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote in an article posted July 11.

The world’s largest online retailer projected operating profit of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $17.8 billion. Sales will be $159 billion to $164 billion in the period ending in June, the company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $161.4 billion.

        "description": "It’s been a great year for TikTok so far, and we can confirm that the social media giant has another reason to celebrate in 2025. The firm just took over Twitch to become the world’s second biggest livestreaming online platform. Remember, the competition in this race has always been top-notch. Other than TikTok and Twitch, YouTube, Mixer, and others continued to go head to head for that top spot. Today, the latest results from the top analytics company, Streams Charts, are out. And they’re confirming how Twitch no longer holds the top or runner-up position. Thanks to the Global Livestreaming Landscape Report, we know that TikTok is number two and Twitch dropped to third position.As a whole, the platforms in charge of livestreaming events managed to generate 29 billion hours in terms of watch time for the first quarter of this year. This figure entails data from TikTok Live. The app is one of the most recent entrants in this streaming space, but it managed to hit the second top spot, only getting edged out by YouTube, which is the clear winner. During the first quarter, TikTok managed to produce 8 billion watch time hours, or nearly 27% of the entire livestreaming industry’s total figures. YouTube stood at the top of the charts with a staggering 50% of the entire industry’s figures, which was equivalent to 14.9 billion watch hours.Twitch got the third spot with 4.8 billion watch hours or 16% of the overall majority. Kick was fourth with 2.9% of the total. The top five were rounded up with niche streaming platforms like SOOP and NimoTV. Towards the list’s bottom was Rumble, which had only 0.5% of that total.Now, Streams Charts says that the lead of YouTube is due to major genre diversity for live content. The app’s gaming division was responsible for nearly 7% of the platform’s 50% share, while Twitch, which is more related to gaming material, held 12% of the 16% share.TikTok’s Live Pop Up gets to be the center of attention quite often. Slowly, it managed to gain traction as a true e-commerce powerhouse and an entity TikTok wants to keenly adapt. TikTok also shared during a recent event how 400k of its creators go live through its app each day, so they target more than 30 million viewers online. Similarly, it shared how 400k streamers collectively produce $10M in terms of revenue every year. Now, 80% of that comes from streamers that have less than 50k followers.Stream Charts data explained how TikTok is so keen on promoting the live sector. See, it already has a stronghold in the industry and makes a huge sum of money for creators on the app. But the fact that TikTok’s Live hours grew 30% from last year to this year is major news. The app is one of four apps to display this kind of growth in the first quarter. Read next: The Real Reason Some Brands Grow Internationally While Others Stall — It Starts With Better Localization",

Meanwhile Amazon garnered some unwanted headlines ahead its earnings, as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren released a letter slamming founder Jeff Bezos and his company, after the e-commerce giant denied it considered displaying tariff costs on some products.

A growing number of Amazon’s wholesale suppliers are weighing a major shift in their business model: ditching Amazon’s first-party vendor program in favor of becoming third-party sellers on its marketplace. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have complicated annual negotiations between Amazon and its suppliers, according to interviews with two vendors and six consultants who represent them. That’s pushing some vendors to consider leaving Amazon’s first-party program — where Amazon buys products in bulk and resells them — to instead sell directly to consumers through Amazon’s third-party marketplace. Wholesale vendors account for about 40% of the products sold on Amazon, while the other 60% come from third-party sellers.This is a member-exclusive article from Modern Retail.

Here's what investors will be watching.Amazon. Wall Street is cautious heading into Amazon's first-quarter earnings. Analysts at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank expect forecasts to be met or surpassed. However, investors' main focus will be the company's second-quarter guidance — the quarter in which the impact of tariffs is expected to be felt. Here's what some of the biggest banks are saying.3 things in markets1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months.2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon.3.

Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI.3 things in tech1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces.2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday.3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs.3 things in business1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI.2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were \"no plans\" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work.3.

        "description": "For the first time in more than 20 years, Amazon’s logo got a touch-up. In fact, all of its logos got a touch-up. The small but subtle changes are part of a company-wide brand system refinement, bringing together more than 50 Amazon sub-brands across categories like pharmacy, groceries, and on-demand streaming under a single brand umbrella. Typography was key to making it all work.A pair of bespoke fonts, Amazon Logo Sans and Ember Modern, tie Amazon products and services together with a unified brand voice that has flexibility for different contexts. This is a brand that’s everywhere, from cardboard boxes to music to prescriptions, and needed to adapt to convey boldness and excitement in use cases like entertainment, but trustworthiness in its healthcare divisions.[Image: Amazon]Koto Studio, the creative agency that worked on the brand system and refresh, started the endeavor by thinking of Amazon’s master brand logo as a type specimen, not just a mark. (Though they did plump up its arrow to give it a deeper “smile.”) The team refined the letterforms in the logo, which eventually became the foundation for a font.“The biggest challenge was the sheer scale,” Koto New York executive creative director Arthur Foliard tells Fast Company of the Amazon brand refresh. “Amazon’s brand had become visually fragmented. Every product or service seemed to have its own logo. It was a sea of arrows with no clear system or structure.”Under the new brand system, the Amazon family of sub-brands, house brands, and core services, from Amazon Basics to Amazon Kids, now have a unified logo system set in the new proprietary Amazon Logo Sans.[Image: Amazon]Ember Modern is a new version of the typeface Amazon originally designed for Kindle screen. Koto updated it with characters for 366 languages and seven weights so it can be used globally in instances like high-impact headlines or for text-heavy, long-form reading. It’s a typeface designed for versatility.They also updated the company’s color palette to standardize its main brand color, Smile Orange; tweak its blue to a more saturated, digital-friendly shade; and give each sub-brand its own bright, expressive color scheme. Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery business, uses shades of green to communicate freshness, while Amazon One Medical, its primary care provider, uses a turquoise green reminiscent of scrubs.“Historically, Amazon teams moved fast, spinning up businesses and logos on the fly to meet customer demand,” Foliard says. “That agility was great, but it sometimes led to brand fragmentation.” [Image: Amazon]Going forward, the agency left the company with an automated “[amazon]:name” command to generate future consistent logos instantly, plus a full logo architecture to define what needs a logo and what doesn’t.With its new brand system and font book, Amazon is better positioned to express its brand and sub-brands across a growing number of categories. If Alexa is the audible voice of Amazon the brand, Amazon Logo Sans and Ember Modern are the brand’s voice in print.",

Amazon said Wednesday (April 30) that it will invest over $4 billion to expand its rural delivery network and provide faster delivery to millions of customers in less densely populated areas. The investment will expand Amazon’s rural delivery network to over 200 delivery stations, create over 100,000 new jobs and enable the retailer’s network to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers in more than 13,000 ZIP codes, Udit Madan, senior vice president, Amazon Worldwide Operations, said in a Wednesday blog post. “At a time when many logistics providers are backing away from serving rural customers because of cost to serve, we are stepping up our investment to make their lives easier and better,” Madan said in the post. Amazon opened its first rural delivery station in 2020, began scaling its small-town delivery network in 2023 and has accelerated its average delivery speeds by 50%, according to the post. “By the end of 2026, we’ll have tripled the size of our rural delivery network, to provide Prime members from Milton, Florida, to North Pole, Alaska, (and thousands of small towns and rural communities in between) the ability to shop from over 300 million items from the convenience of their homes and receive their packages even faster — cutting average delivery times in half,” Madan said in the post. It was reported that Amazon was ramping up its logistics expansion efforts by acquiring industrial property and restructuring its distribution network to speed delivery and reduce costs. At the time, the company had leased, bought or announced plans for over 16 million square feet of new warehouse space in the U.S. in the first five months of 2024, adding to its existing footprint of about 413 million square feet of industrial real estate across the country. UPS said Tuesday (April 29) that it was accelerating its planned volume reduction from Amazon, long a major customer, and now expects to slash Amazon package volume in its network by more than 50% by June 2026. UPS executives said the decision reflects UPS’ pivot away from low-margin, high-volume accounts and toward more profitable business.

        "description": "Display has a nice design and plenty of ports, but color E Ink has downsides. Color E Ink in its current state requires a whole lot of compromises, as we've found when reviewing devices like reMarkable's Paper Pro or Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft, including washed-out color, low refresh rates, and a grainy look that you don't get with regular black-and-white E Ink. But that isn't stopping device manufacturers from exploring the technology, and today, Onyx International has announced that it has a $1,900 color E Ink monitor that you can connect to your PC or Mac. The Boox Mira Pro is a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and it builds on the company's previous black-and-white Mira Pro monitors. The Verge reports that the screen uses E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, which can display up to 4,096 colors. Both image quality and refresh rate will vary based on which of the monitor's four presets you use (the site isn't specific about the exact refresh rate, but does note that \"E Ink monitors' refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors', and increased speed will result in more ghosting.\") The monitor's ports include one full-size HDMI port, a mini HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. Its default stand is more than a little reminiscent of Apple's Studio Display, but it also supports VESA mounting.Read full article Comments",

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreOur beauty editor's favorite thickening shampoo is on sale for the Amazon Summer Beauty Event.Dr. GrootYears of color, heat, and chemicals can leave our hair dry, frizzy, and prone to breakage. But instead of incorporating even more products into your hair routine, swapping out your shampoo for one without harmful sulfates and other harsh ingredients could be just what your hair and scalp need. That said, good shampoos can sometimes be pricey. Luckily, one of our favorites, the Dr. Groot Scalp Revitalizing Solution Shampoo, is on sale now during Amazon's Summer Beauty Event.Follow our WhatsApp channel on mobile for more shopping content from the Reviews TeamOur beauty editors on the Reviews Team have tested dozens of shampoos, so their recommendation is worth listening to. \"My first instinct when I read a shampoo ingredient list is to check for sulfates, which dry out my already-dry hair. This formula has none. Instead, it's infused with rosemary oil, which in my opinion, has helped curb breakage whenever I comb my hair in the shower,\" says Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style and beauty editor. \"I use styling creams on my curls, which leads to a lot of dry, flaky buildup and uncomfortable itchiness. This shampoo helps my scalp feel refreshed and cleansed.\"In addition to growth-supporting rosemary oil, the shampoo is formulated with nourishing biotin and prebiotics which lead to stronger, healthier hair. It's free of harsh ingredients like parabens and silicones, and it's safe for color-treated hair. Unlike other shampoos, which can strip hair of moisture, this one exfoliates, cleanses, and moisturizes the hair and scalp, leaving hair soft and voluminous.With hundreds of five-star reviews, Amazon shoppers have also seen results with this shampoo. \"Love this shampoo. I've been using it for two months now. My scalp feels so much cleaner and my hair is less frizzy,\" said one reviewer. \"My hair feels bouncy. The shampoo lathers enough to refresh my hair and make it feel stronger.\"Some shoppers even found the shampoo helpful in reversing years of previous damage. \"My hair was damaged from using chemicals to straighten it all the time as well as using a flat iron. It was pretty bad. Plus, I damaged it to the point where it was patchy or missing hair in some places,\" said another reviewer. \"After two to three weeks of using this, my hair looks as good as it did when I was in high school. Shiny and volume like crazy. I don't even have to flat iron because it looks good even without it. Plus, most of the bald spots from using perm are now growing hair again after four years of it being gone.With the current Summer Beauty Event discount on Amazon, the Scalp Revitalizing Solution is 30% off.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreAt just $30 for the Amazon Summer Beauty Event, this blow dryer brush is a steal considering what it can accomplish.Samantha Crozier/InsiderGood hot tools make a world of difference when it comes to styling your hair. The best ones help you get out the door with a full blowout in minutes while also saving your hair from unwanted heat damage and breakage. That said, some can cost you hundreds of dollars. Luckily, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer does an equally good job without sending you into debt. Plus, it's more affordable than ever during the Amazon Summer Beauty Event.Follow our WhatsApp channel on mobile for more shopping content from the Reviews TeamIt may be hard to believe that the Revlon One-Step boasts similar quality to popular styling tools like the Dyson Airwrap, which cost hundreds of dollars more. But we've tried it for ourselves and were impressed. \"I'm not the type of person to spend very much on my hair, so when I heard about a Dyson Airwrap dupe that costs less than $50, I was sold,\" says Sarah Saril, deals and how-to-watch editor on the Reviews Team. \"Of course, at hundreds of dollars less, the Revlon One-Step isn't nearly as feature-packed or smoothly designed as the Dyson users compare it to. It is, however, a versatile, all-in-one tool that gives me a salon-worthy blowout in minutes. I can't recommend it enough, especially with this ongoing discount.\"The One-Step features three speeds and heat settings, plus a cool shot feature, allowing you to control how much heat you're using on your hair, though you'll still need to use a heat protectant, of course. The oval brush design is easy to hold and perfect for smoothing down hair while also lifting the roots and adding volume. But it's the price that's really hard to beat. \"It's not the best deal we've ever seen—this tool specifically can hit some very low prices during the holidays. Regardless, it's still a worthwhile deal, especially since promotions for it have been few and far between in recent years,\" Saril explains.There were exactly ten minutes of styling between taking the first and second picture.Samantha Crozier/InsiderWith nearly 400,000 five-star reviews, Amazon shoppers can't get enough of the One-Step either. \"I've been using this for four years, and it has completely transformed my hair routine! If you're tired of juggling a brush and a blow dryer, this all-in-one tool is an absolute game changer,\" said one reviewer. \"After four years of regular use, the volumizer is still going strong. It has maintained its performance, and I'm genuinely impressed by its durability…My hair looks smoother and has significantly less frizz compared to using a standard blow dryer.\"Shoppers love how well it works for different hair types. \"My mom, daughter, and I all have one…My mom and daughter have very thick hair, and mine is thinner. My daughter and I have tons of natural curl. We all used to take an hour blow drying and styling, but this tool cut our time in half,\" said another reviewer. \"We have all experienced our best hair days since using it…The brush doesn't tangle in your hair so you can really get in and create volume. It's a fairly light tool and tons easier than managing a round bush and blow dryer.\"With the current Summer Beauty Event discount on Amazon, the Revlon One-Step is 27% off.

        "description": "Multiple e-commerce giants including Temu and Shein have seen prices soar in the US, with a set of kitchen towels setting the outer limit with a 377% jump. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will not display the cost of US tariffs on products, after the White House blasted the reported move and US President Donald Trump called Jeff Bezos to complain. Trump enacted levies in an attempt to force Beijing to seek a trade deal that would slash the trade deficit between the two countries, and reiterated this week that he expects China to “eat” the tariffs. While he denied there would be difficult times ahead for American shoppers, US consumer confidence dropped to a five-year low in April. The evidence is also mounting that consumer inflation has set in and will only grow. Bloomberg's Peter Elstrom discusses the latest on \"The Pulse with Francine Lacqua\" on Bloomberg TV.

        "description": "The Trump administration has made clear that it doesn’t want shoppers to see how much its new tariffs are costing them, based on its forceful reaction to one report yesterday. The dustup started with a relatively sparse story from Punchbowl News, a D.C.-based news outlet mainly focused on political scoops, which reported that Amazon had planned to show how much a product’s price is derived from tariffs next to its total price in website listings. The Trump administration did not exactly respond to the idea of a price transparency label with an even keel. In a press briefing yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Amazon’s purported design update, which had yet to be confirmed, “a hostile and political act.” No matter DOGE’s supposed interest in transparency, the administration otherwise seems to find it a “hostile” idea. Following Trump’s chastisement, Amazon denied the claim, stating that while its low-cost Temu competitor Amazon Haul had considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products, the company never considered listing tariff upcharges on its main site, and that such a plan “is not going to happen.” By jumping to condemn Amazon’s potential new feature, the White House as good as broadcasted that it’s worried about companies exposing how much the president’s tariffs are costing consumers, and it’s prepared to name and shame them to prevent that from happening. But its heavy-handed reaction also points to how, with just a few design tweaks, private companies could play against the administration’s self-inflicted political weak spot to gain consumer trust and influence the public messaging game on tariffs, if they’re brave enough. (Amazon wasn’t, and Trump praised founder Jeff Bezos as having done “the right thing” following the company’s statement.) The widespread cost of Trump’s tariffs The president’s tariff policies have produced massive ripple effects across the supply chain for many companies that manufacture overseas, and more can be expected. Already, the 145% duty on Chinese-made goods has caused cargo shipments into the U.S. to plummet by as much as 60% since early April, according to one estimate from the supply chain logistics firm Flexport. Since announcing his sweeping tariff plan in early April, Trump has frequently suspended proposed tariffs and issued exemptions on certain goods following lobbying from tech companies like Apple and blowback from Wall Street, demonstrating that his plan is not exactly going off without a hitch—and leaving consumers confused about what’s actually getting more expensive. Retail giants including Adidas, Target, and Walmart have warned that prices could go up and shelves will begin to empty if the tariffs continue. Meanwhile, others that rely heavily or solely on Chinese factories have already bumped up their prices, including Amazon, Shein, and Temu, which all use cheap, Chinese-made goods to fuel their business models. Several upmarket brands, like Labucq, Jolie, and Dieux Skin have likewise announced tariff-based price hikes. The tariffs have proven to be a PR and approval ratings disaster for Trump, who on the campaign trail promised voters he’d lower everyday costs but instead is culpable for raising them. According to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, Trump’s approval rating is currently 42%—the lowest on record for any newly elected president in more than 50 years. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that 69% of Americans believe Trump is not focusing enough on lowering prices, while 62% believe that he’s spending too much time imposing tariffs. Based on this public reception, it makes sense that Trump’s administration would want tariff-based price increases to remain intangible to American consumers. Amazon backed down, but more brands should show the receipts At the same time, from a consumer’s perspective, it’s difficult to keep up with how each company is being hit by the tariffs—and what the actual scale of incoming price increases might look like for everyday goods like toilet paper and groceries without direct comparisons at the point of sale. This trade policy decision has had costly consequences, and Amazon’s proposal could have been a simple, user-first solution to show the public the tariff receipts. Major retailers like Target and Walmart could clear up some of the confusion by doing exactly what Amazon has since declined to do: add a label to online listings (and even in-store items) spelling out how much Trump’s tariffs have impacted the sale price for consumers. This simple gesture could serve as an effective political tool to shape public perception and shift policy on a key issue. And for brands, it would also communicate to consumers that price transparency matters more than the president’s whims.",

        "description": "In the days before a recent ballot referendum in Seattle that would determine the future of social housing in the city, large tech companies spent big. Amazon and Microsoft, both of which are headquartered in the Seattle metropolitan area, each donated $100,000, and opponents of a tax to fund social housing spent a combined $780,000 in the lead-up to the February 11 vote. Despite this, the vote on a corporate tax to fund the city’s social housing authority won, with 63% of voters supporting it. In 2023, voters had already resoundingly approved the social housing authority, agreeing that a new entity would be created to acquire and construct mixed-income housing and keep it permanently affordable and under the city’s ownership. But this February, voters were asked to return to the polls to determine how to fund the authority—or whether it would be funded at all. The first question on the ballot asked if voters approved of funding the new authority using payroll taxes. Next, voters had to choose whether they wanted a new 5% payroll tax on individual compensation above $1,000,000, paid by companies, or to use an existing payroll tax that mostly funds affordable housing. The new tax could bring in $52 million of funding each year for social housing. The second option would appropriate $10 million a year for five years that had already been set aside. The city’s big tech companies had no interest in paying a new tax. In addition to contributions from Amazon and Microsoft, Seattle’s Chamber of Commerce donated $40,000 and T-Mobile donated $20,000 to derail an additional tax on companies. But according to Tiffani McCoy of House Our Neighbors, a Seattle nonprofit that has been one of the lead supporters of the social housing authority, the influx of spending actually hurt Big Tech’s case. “Frankly, Amazon donating was a godsend for us,” McCoy says. “We capitalized on the fact that Amazon and Microsoft were dumping in $100,000, and we made clear to voters that these corporations don’t want you to have social housing.” McCoy says the campaign to fund the social housing authority with a corporate tax sent mailers, paid for digital advertising, and made social media posts that played up the tech companies’ donations. Supporters also held a rally in front of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. “There’s a lot of resentment toward tech billionaires who are part of the Trump regime here in Seattle,” she says. The win suggests a way forward for organizers on the local level to take the housing crisis into their own hands. Persistent federal inaction and recent drastic attacks to HUD have provided motivation. “We needed to Trump-proof our housing sector,” McCoy says. “And I think that helps because there’s mass opposition to what he’s doing.” The vote also showcased a groundswell of resentment toward Big Tech that has been percolating among voters. The authority will initially be modest in its ambitions, as it won’t have funding to develop housing anywhere near the scope or scale of the private market. The plan is to build or preserve 300 units a year, once funding comes in, according to the social housing development authority—but it will own those units and will be able to issue its own debt. The first step, proponents say, is to make sure the money actually comes through. What will Seattle’s social housing authority do? The initial ballot referendum to build a social housing authority in Seattle passed in February 2023 with 57% of the vote. It created a public development authority, a type of government-owned private entity that can take out debt by issuing bonds. The term “social housing” has been used broadly in recent years to refer to types of housing that are not subject to the speculative market, including public housing, forms of subsidized affordable housing, and housing owned by community land trusts. Seattle’s referendum referred to social housing as “publicly owned and financed mixed-income housing intended to be permanently affordable.” According to the housing authority’s charter, that means it will acquire or build housing and rent it to people making between 0% and 120% of the area median income, with rents never exceeding 30% of a tenant’s income. The median income for a family of four in Seattle is about $160,000, according to the Seattle Housing Authority. That means families in properties owned by the authority could be paying between $0 and about $4,700 a month, depending on their income. Since the authority’s properties are not meant to be resold, it could provide a modicum of stability to lifelong renters as they age. Market-rate properties are meant to increase in value every year, but seniors with fixed incomes don’t see their pay increase as they age. For decades, working Americans in general haven’t seen their pay increase significantly. The authority’s charter also creates a mediation provision for tenants to prevent evictions: According to the charter, “residents MUST be afforded opportunities for restorative justice conflict resolution prior to being subject to eviction procedures.” “There’s not the pressure of somebody’s investment that is in cross purposes to their ability to stay there,” says Julie Howe, a Seattle Social Housing board member. The authority will issue its own debt in the form of bonds and create a revolving loan fund, lending itself money for construction and acquisition that would be paid back through rents, with higher rents subsidizing lower rents. Debt is a large and under-discussed factor in the cost of housing, as developers often price units to pay back loans. By using its own funds for construction, the authority will be able to reduce interest payments that can cause rents to balloon. The authority will be governed by a board with 13 members, including 7 appointed by the Seattle Renters’ Commission, an advisory board that consults with the mayor and city council. They will be mainly focused on the authority’s fiscal responsibilities and making sure it remains aligned with its mission. While public housing is notoriously underfunded in the United States, the result of a bipartisan aversion to government-owned housing, McCoy says the mixed-income approach that Seattle is taking with its own development authority might prove more sustainable, as it doesn’t require as much direct subsidy. The authority’s approach is also less convoluted than building housing using Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which requires multiple layers of financing on top of the federally issued credits. But there still needs to be a dedicated revenue stream to staff the development authority, to purchase and construct housing, and to issue bonds. The state law establishing public development authorities does not allow them to impose taxes. And the 2023 ballot referendum was limited to creating the authority; a dedicated funding stream was always going to require a second ballot measure. Some opponents of the social housing authority, which includes not just big tech but affordable housing developers, believed that the new ballot measure was an opportunity to relitigate whether the authority should be established at all. “They’re really looking for a do-over,” McCoy said prior to the February vote. Taxing the wealthy Rather than opposing the authority outright, opponents opted to put option 1B on the ballot to essentially recreate the affordable housing system that exists in Seattle, with no new funding. That option would have effectively made the social housing development authority moot: the city’s affordable housing fund that it would have pulled from can only go toward people making 80% of the area median income or lower, which means that the authority would not be able to cross-subsidize rents. According to Howe, the board member, this would have put the agency in conflict with affordable housing developers who rely on the existing funding stream. “That would essentially go against how we were founded,” Howe says. Suresh Chanmugam, a tech worker organizing with the group Tech for Housing, says tech companies don’t mind Washington having one of the most regressive tax codes in the nation. Because the state has no income tax, most taxes are derived from consumer sales and property, regressive taxes where poorer people have an effective tax rate much higher than the wealthiest. Chanmugam believes rich companies use the lack of an income tax as a pretext to pay their employees less than they would in other states. He says that dozens of members of the Tech for Housing coalition knocked on doors, tabled at farmers markets and phone banked across the city. “When people hear, ‘Hey, do you want to tax companies to fund social housing?’, people say yes, because there’s near universal appeal in Seattle for making big businesses pay their fair share in taxes,” Chanmugam says. He says he personally spoke to about 300 voters while canvassing and only received pushback from one or two people. It makes sense that tech workers have opposing priorities to their employers: While tech workers are typically high earners, many would benefit from the social housing authority, which would ensure that people making 120% of AMI, or around $190,000 for a family of four, would pay only 30% of their wages toward rent in units it owns. That would greatly offset any pass-through cost put on their wages by tech companies. According to campaign finance records, Microsoft and Amazon were tied for the highest donations to the campaign for option 1B—using existing tax—at $100,000 each. It’s not the first time that spending from tech companies has backfired in Seattle. In 2019, Amazon and the Chamber of Commerce supported a slate of City Council candidates, most of whom lost. The corporate tax was also opposed by the mayor; ads for option 1B, which would use existing funds, had pictures of his face on it. One opp",

It even broaches the possibility that US President Donald Trump might ban foreign companies from using AWS.In a recent CNBC interview, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the situation remains fluid and emphasized efforts by the company's e-commerce business to keep consumer prices low. Still, he hinted that some third-party sellers might raise prices in response to tariffs. He also noted that, despite the uncertainty, Amazon continues its data center expansion.Amazon, whose stock has dropped about 15% this year, is set to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday.A spokesperson for the company referred BI to a statement from the internal document:\"We're closely monitoring the situation, and we are working to assess the impact on our business. As we navigate the evolving trade policy landscape, our focus remains on delivering value to our customers and innovating on their behalf.\"Do not 'speculate'Tariff-driven price hikes have already become a flashpoint in Amazon's retail division.As BI previously reported, internal teams have struggled with forecasting, and vendors say Amazon has offered cost relief in exchange for strict margin guarantees. Meanwhile, third-party sellers say they're being forced to raise prices due to rising import costs.AWS CEO Matt GarmanAmazonWhat this means for AWS pricing remains unclear. Internal guidance tells employees not to \"speculate,\" citing the rapidly evolving nature of trade policy.Some cloud industry experts suggest tariffs could squeeze AWS more than the company lets on.AWS relies heavily on high-end computing gear, much of it manufactured in China or Taiwan. While some semiconductor components were recently exempted from tariffs, other critical data center parts may still be affected. Trump has paused most new tariffs for 90 days, but a 145% tariff on Chinese goods remains in effect.\"AWS and other hyperscalers could choose to absorb the cost or pass it on to customers,\" said Travis Rehl, CTO of cloud consultancy Innovative Solutions. \"I'm unsure which direction they'd take.\"Ben Schaechter, CEO of cloud cost optimization firm Vantage, said tariffs could force AWS to tighten future discounts or slow infrastructure growth due to higher hardware costs.The bigger threat, some say, is reduced cloud spending. \"Amazon's AWS business should see limited tariff impact, though a broader economic slowdown is a risk to IT spend.\"Randall Hunt, CTO of cloud advisory firm Caylent, told BI that customers are already cutting back in broad spending in anticipation of slower growth and rising costs.Data sovereignty and Trump-era fearsThe growing uncertainty over Trump's actions has pushed Amazon to prepare for even more extreme scenarios, including potential US government demands for cloud customer data or a move to block non-US users from accessing AWS.If asked about potential US government data requests, Amazon instructed employees to emphasize that AWS does not disclose customer information unless legally required and that all requests are thoroughly reviewed.The guidance also clarifies AWS's position on the CLOUD Act, or Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act. The CLOUD Act, passed in 2018, gives US law enforcement agencies the authority to access data held by US-based companies, even if stored abroad. AWS has not provided enterprise or government customer data stored outside the US since at least 2020 and it will challenge any \"over-broad\" or unlawful requests, the document stated.\"The CLOUD Act does not provide the U.S. government with unfettered access to data held by cloud providers,\" the document added.President Donald Trump.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOn the question of whether Trump could block foreign access to AWS, the document stops short of addressing whether the president has the authority, but notes there's no indication such action is imminent.In fact, it argues that doing so would contradict the administration's stated goal of supporting US tech companies abroad.\"AWS is closely plugged into US policy and this Administration's efforts, and can confirm we have heard nothing about restricting cloud services to non-US customers in response to addressing trade imbalances or unfair trade barriers, and expect their focus to continue to be on tariffs as the 'rebalancing' mechanism,\" the document said.Sanctions and 'Buy Canada'AWS also addresses fears that US sanctions could restrict access to its services in certain countries. The guidance notes that full country-wide sanctions are rare and that in the past, companies have been given time to wind down operations when sanctions do occur.\"US country-wide sanctions or services restrictions are exceedingly rare,\" the document said. \"But in the theoretical case that such sanctions ever came to pass, AWS would do everything practically possible to provide continuity of service.\"Finally, AWS is preparing for patriotic backlash in some markets, such as a potential \"Buy Canada\" movement. Employees are told to clarify that AWS's Canada office is a registered Canadian corporation headquartered in Toronto, and that customers can choose to store their data locally and encrypt it.Still, the guidance urges caution. Employees should be careful framing AWS as a \"Canadian business,\" given the complexity of the term.\"Whether AWS is a 'Canadian business' will depend on how that is defined in particular circumstances,\" the document concludes.Have a tip?

        "description": "Wall Street is bracing for Amazon's earnings guidance for the current quarter, as tariffs and slowing consumer demand create high uncertainty. Future Publishing/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesAmazon will report first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday.Uncertainty is high as tariffs could directly impact the e-commerce firm.But outlooks among Wall Street firms remain relatively strong.Wall Street is feeling upbeat but cautious before Amazon's first-quarter earnings report on Thursday.While investors are eager to gauge how the e-commerce giant performed amid the rise in recession fears during the first three months of the year, Amazon's second-quarter guidance will be particularly important.That's because the company is especially vulnerable to tariffs, which could create a particularly challenging environment for retailers.Still, Wall Street remains bullish on the firm's results, looking for signs of strength from Amazon Web Services and AI spending.Here's what the biggest banks are saying:Deutsche Bank: Cautious about full-year 2025Amazon will meet conservative expectations for the first quarter, but things will get trickier from here, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.Earnings revenue should come in strong at $155.5 billion, boosted by a weaker dollar. But while April shows signs of strength, with consumer demand bolstered by fears of painful tariffs later in the year, investors shouldn't expect that to last.Deutsche listed a handful of overhangs that could lead to challenges going forward. They include a revenue slowdown in the second half of the year, weak ad checks in the first quarter, and tariff implications for costs and advertising revenue.\"All in, we believe it best to be cautious at this point, and model total 2Q revenue growth $159bn ~170bps below the street, on Q/Q growth of only 2% as we look for a more muted consumer demand environment to drive sub-seasonal growth for Amazon as we move through year,\" analysts wrote.Deutsche holds a \"Buy\" rating on the stock, with a $206 share price target.Bank of America sees Amazon as a potential trade-deal beneficiaryAmazon can deliver a strong first quarter, Bank of America said, but the company is entering \"unchartered (and tariffed) seas in 2Q.\"BofA analysts expect Amazon to slightly beat consensus estimates with $155.5 billion in sales, predicting that consumer spending held up well amid tariff jitters. Meanwhile, the bank said expectations for 17.4% year-to-year AWS growth are realistic.While BofA mirrored Deutsche Bank's uncertainty on how tariffs could disrupt future quarters, it remains optimistic.\"We acknowledge 2Q & 2H revenue uncertainty (retail, ads and Cloud), but remain confident on Amazon's ability to take share in eCommerce, improve retail margins via headcount cuts, & benefit from Cloud AI demand,\" BofA wrote. Shares of Amazon, a trade deal beneficiary, could benefit from tariff negotiations.Bank of America maintains its \"Buy\" rating, and holds a price objective of $225.CFRA: Tariffs will drive market shareAnalyst Arun Sundaram expects Amazon to beat first-quarter estimates, forecasting $155.2 billion in revenue and $18.1 billion in operating profits.Supporting margins are a sliding greenback, tariff-hastened consumption, e-commerce cost reductions, and faster growth in advertising, cloud, and subscriptions.As with other firms, CFRA instead expects guidance for second-quarter earnings to be particularly important for investors. But while they're a near-term risk, Sundaram sees tariffs as an opportunity for Amazon to boost market share. Meanwhile, the end to the de minimis import rule next month, which exempts tariffs on lower-priced goods, could make Amazon more competitive against firms like Temu or eBay.Amazon's spending plans will also be top of mind for investors, given the company's mixed signals on capital expenditures. Though the firm is a major AI hyperscaler, CFRA sees a possibility that investment spending pulls back amid a weaker macroeconomic outlook.On April 24, CFRA lowered Amazon's price target to $245 per share.JPMorgan says stay bullish on the cloud and AIThe outlook for Amazon remains fundamentally positive, with several factors justifying bullish expectations, JPMorgan said.The bank expects rising operating income, improved positioning in the artificial intelligence sector, and AWS cloud growth to pick up in the second half of the year. First-quarter sales should reach $154 billion, while AWS will expand 16.5%.\"We remain bullish as AMZN drives non-Al growth & tightens the GenAl gap, which supports improved AWS trends in 2H,\" analysts wrote. \"N.America margins continue to expand supported by inbound regionalization & inventory placement, SD facility buildout, & automation/robotics, supporting FC ramp despite heavy 2025 cape growth.\"To be sure, tariffs will be the near-term threat, but Amazon has options, JPMorgan said. Although 30% to 40% of products could be sourced from China, the firm could pressure suppliers to take on added costs, cancel orders, re-route supply chains, or have consumers bear the cost of tariffs.JPMorgan rates Amazon \"Overweight,\" with a $220 price target for the stock.Goldman Sachs: Reducing China exposureGoldman analysts lowered estimates to showcase a more conservative outlook, as dropping consumer confidence and rising trade barriers bite into Amazon's margins.Amazon faces key risks ranging from product inflation to profit headwinds stemming from the firm's investment frenzy.However, when it comes to headwinds, a Goldman analysis found that Amazon could significantly mitigate costs by reducing exposure to China, and focusing more on domestic merchandise.\"AMZN continues to be the most debated stock among our wider coverage universe on the back of higher global trade tensions,\" the analysts wrote. \"Looking long-term, AMZN remains one of our top picks and provides investors with a range of exposures to virtually all key secular growth themes across Consumer Internet and Cloud Computing.\"Goldman holds a \"Buy\" rating with a $220 target on the Amazon stock.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "UPS is downsizing its workforce as it pulls back from delivering packages for Amazon, its largest customer. The post UPS to eliminate 20K jobs as Amazon decoupling accelerates appeared first on FreightWaves. UPS plans to shed about 20,000 front-line positions in 2025 as it manages the decline in unprofitable business from Amazon and a huge restructuring of its delivery network, executives said Tuesday during a first-quarter earnings briefing. The integrated parcel and logistics giant in January reached an agreement to reduce Amazon volumes in its network by more than 50% by June 2026. Outbound deliveries from Amazon fulfillment centers are not profitable compared to returns and outbound volumes from retailers that sell on the Amazon marketplace. About 60% of UPS’s Amazon business is lossmaking. Meanwhile, UPS (NYSE: UPS) one year ago announced an aggressive strategy for network consolidation and automation aimed at improving profitability by better matching capacity and labor with lower parcel volumes. Management told analysts on Tuesday that the Amazon transition plan has been factored into the company’s network reconfiguration. The optimization plan, called Network of the Future, envisions closing 200 sortation centers over five years. UPS intends to close 164 operational shifts in the first phase of the program, including 73 buildings by the end of June, Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes said on the earnings conference call. The company, for example, recently disclosed plans to temporarily close a facility in Portland, Oregon, this summer to enable renovations. Dykes said the initiative is expected to eliminate $3.5 billion in expenses this year alone. About 35% of the savings will come from culling 25 million operating hours across the workforce. Semi-variable costs will be reduced by a similar amount through the reduction of 20,000 positions across the entire U.S. network. Both of those cost reductions are directly tied to the separation from Amazon, UPS’ largest customer. An additional 30% of the savings is attributed to lower fixed costs such as fewer buildings and support functions. “United Parcel Service is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement. If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement responding to UPS’ plan to take out 20,000 jobs. The shrinkage of Amazon volumes during the first half of 2025 tracks with expectations, the executive team said. Average daily volume decline is expected to accelerate to 30% in the second half after declining about 16% in the first half of the year. “While our building footprint is changing, our pickup and delivery footprint is not. We remain committed to providing industry leading reliability to all customers across the country. We’ll just do it with fewer buildings,” CEO Carol Tome said. “For our larger customers, we are working with them to update their operating plan and for our [small and medium businesses] in the areas where we’re closing buildings, UPS will still be accessible and convenient for customer dropoffs and pickups” through its retail stores, drop boxes and access points. At the end of the network restructuring, there will be 400 facilities that are partially or fully automated, said Nando Cesarone, president, U.S. operations. “The end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor,” he said. In addition to automating sort centers, UPS is studying the use of robotics for automatic label application, unloading and loading trailers, and other sort functions, Tome said. The efficiency programs combined with jettisoning unprofitable Amazon business gives management confidence it can hit its 12% target for U.S. operating margin, she added. UPS earlier this year also launched an efficiency drive aimed at redesigning internal processes that it estimates will save $1 billion by next year. Some analysts suggested UPS should be generating more savings from its restructuring. Investors were expecting $5 billion in savings over the next 18 months on top of previously announced cost take outs, Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shankar said in a client note. Management is essentially replacing the previous 2028 target of $4 billion in annual spending reductions ($3 billion from Network of the Future and $1 billion from the process efficiency initiative) with a three-year program “of undisclosed size but with $3.5 billion coming in 2025 – making it very hard to tell how much” in incremental savings are still possible, he wrote. Tariff headwinds UPS results in the first quarter slightly beat analysts’ expectations, which were lowered in recent weeks because of the turmoil in global markets caused by the U.S. government’s aggressive global tariff policies. Revenue slipped 0.7% year over year to $21.5 billion, while adjusted operating profit inched up 1% to $1.7 billion. UPS did not provide updated full-year guidance because of the uncertain macroeconomic environment triggered by the U.S. government’s aggressive global tariff policies. But projections in the second quarter are negative year over year. Revenue is expected to be $21 billion, down from $21.8 billion, with average daily domestic volume down about 9% year over year. International revenue will be down about 2% due to lower demand-related surcharges and tariff uncertainty. UPS’ direct exposure to tariffs is limited. U.S. import volume is about 400,000 pieces per day, which represents less than 2% of total global average daily volume. China to the United States is the most profitable trade for UPS, representing 11% of total international revenue. Revenue from other countries to the U.S. is about 17% of total international revenue. During the first quarter, international revenue increased 2.7%, driven by a 7.1% increase in average daily volume. UPS said it saw demand for U.S. inbound service surge as customers pulled forward inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes. UPS expects weakening demand for U.S. imports from China, which faces tariffs of 145%, to be offset by growth on China-to non-U.S. trade lanes, as well as growth from other parts of the world to the U.S. It is running models for all types of scenarios so it can make operational adjustments as the year progresses. The company’s top 100 customers are exploring a range of tactics to cope with tariffs, including absorbing the costs, passing them to consumers and asking suppliers to eat some of the increase, said Tome. The company has also surveyed nearly 45,000 freight forwarding customers, most of which said they are using existing inventory levels to support sales. Many large importers stockpiled merchandise 30 to 90 days earlier than usual to avoid the tariffs that kicked in earlier this month. The deferred orders are leading to lower shipping activity. Importers also say they are shifting more shipments from airfreight to ocean freight, where possible. Air cargo containers are moved on a special floor with rollers at the UPS Worldport in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo: Eric Kulisch/FreightWaves) “We do see some volume deceleration in both enterprise and small and medium business, particularly in SMB, because they do not have the tools to deal with the changes that our enterprise customers do. That will put some pressure on revenue per package and margin,” Dykes said. Smaller companies don’t have the working capital to pre-order inventory and have less ability to get contract manufacturers to switch to non-China countries than large retailers, Tome added. Online shoppers on Chinese platforms will experience huge price hikes on May 2, when the U.S. ends a tariff exemption for low-dollar shipments, triggering the 145% duties plus other processing costs. Temu and fast-fashion merchant Shein are showing consumers the import fees during checkout, and Amazon reportedly will do the same thing. UPS has long promoted its ability to make it easier for small businesses to engage in global trade by accessing its closed-loop global network, expertise and technology. It recently introduced a new tool for retailers called Global Checkout. It uses AI to assess items in the shopping cart and calculate the correct import duty, shipping and handling fees, and taxes at time of purchase Other domestic developments Average domestic daily volume was lower than expected because of a pullback by some customers in response to tariff uncertainty created by the Trump administration. During the quarter, UPS completed the insourcing of its SurePost final-mile delivery product from the U.S. Postal Service and changed the name of its most economical shipping service to Ground Saver. Regaining full control of the product, which is primarily used by large retailers to ship goods to residences, gives UPS more operational flexibility and reliability with nearly no increase in cost after the Postal Service began to raise transportation prices. Tome said on-time delivery for Ground Saver was 97% during the first quarter. The parcel giant also reintroduced ground delivery with freight pricing for shipments greater than 150 pounds, offering parcel-like pricing for less-than-truckload shipments. UPS sold its UPS Freight business to TFI International four years ago. Domestic revenue grew 1.4%, driven by increases in air cargo and a 4.5% improvement in revenue per piece, which partially offset a decline in volume. The domestic segment increased operating profit by $164 million year over year. Average daily ground volume decreased 2.5% year over year, and total air volume was down 9.6%, in part because of the glide down in Amazon business. Excluding the volume decline from Amaz",

        "description": "Consumers are only just starting to feel pain from Trump’s Liberation Day tariff spree. Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos, however, may be starting to feel something else from the tariffs: regret. When a report emerged overnight claiming that Amazon would start displaying tariff costs on its main page, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded by torching Amazon in a Tuesday morning press briefing. (According to CNN, Trump had already personally chewed Bezos out by then.) Despite everything that Bezos has done to support Trump in his second term, the administration just made it crystal-clear that presidential support under Trump only flows in one direction. Evidently, no amount of fealty was ever going to save Amazon from Trump’s wrath if throwing Bezos under the bus ever proved advantageous in the slightest. Although Amazon strongly disputes the initial report about displaying tariff costs (“This was never approved and is not going to happen.”), such a move would not be unheard of. Other businesses, including Fabletics and Temu, have been introducing “tariff surcharges,” alerting customers in letters, and adding tariff prices to websites and bills. Meanwhile, Amazon has reportedly been hurting more than most under Trump’s 145% tariffs on China. Leavitt did not seem to think Amazon was justified in potentially joining those other companies, though. Speaking on behalf of Trump, she described it as “a hostile and political act by Amazon.” REPORTER: Amazon will soon display a number next to the price of each product that shows how much the Trump tariffs are adding. Isn't that a perfect demonstration that it's the American consumer who is paying for these policies? LEAVITT: This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.[image or embed]— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) April 29, 2025 at 9:03 AM “It’s not a surprise,” Leavitt continued, “because, as Reuters recently wrote, Amazon is partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.” She held up a printout of the article, about an Amazon project known as China Books, to prove it was real—though “recent” is a bit of a stretch, considering the article came out in 2021. This broadside seems designed to provide a handy talking point about why Amazon is, in this administration’s apparent view, in cahoots with China against Trump. Surely, Amazon’s reported stab at pricing transparency is an act of political hostility and sabotage, Leavitt’s comments suggest, not an accurate temperature-read of a climate in which consumer confidence has already plunged to its lowest levels since peak pandemic 2020. It’s obvious why the administration would want to paint Amazon as the villain in this situation. An April survey of 400 U.S. company leaders by the research firm Zilliant found 44% of businesses plan to pass tariff costs onto consumers. A company of Amazon’s size and stature leading the charge would give any companies who remain on the fence permission to go for it. If Amazon is displaying tariff costs, showing customers who to blame, it becomes standard procedure. What is far less obvious, though, is why Bezos ever worked so hard to get on Trump’s good side in the first place. During Trump’s first term, Bezos had a contentious relationship with the president. Trump would frequently affix “Amazon” to the title of the newspaper Bezos owns, The Washington Post, when speaking about the paper after he received unfavorable coverage. The implication was that the paper was little more than a lobbying arm for Bezos’s personal business interests. Bezos even argued in a 2019 court case that Trump’s bias against Amazon had cost it a chance to win a $10 billion Pentagon contract. In Trump’s second term, though, past has not been prologue. Bezos’s sharp pivot toward MAGA began last October with his out-of-nowhere announcement that the Post would not be endorsing a candidate in the November election. Though he cited the move as a way to avoid “a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don’t believe the media,” the last-minute announcement only fostered a perception of bias—at the Post, specifically. The non-endorsement reportedly cost the paper over 250,000 subscribers. At the time, Bezos could have plausibly still maintained a sheen of neutrality. He has only since further positioned himself firmly in Trump’s corner, though. In the past few months, he’s drastically scaled back DEI policies at Amazon, donated a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund (and prominently attended it), dined at Mar-a-Lago, and overhauled the Post’s op-ed section in support of two Trump-friendly pillars: personal liberties and free markets—a move that reportedly cost the paper another 75,000 subscribers. In Bezos’s most sycophantic-seeming gesture of all, Amazon even shelled out $40 million for a documentary on Melania Trump. The ostensible reason for this red carpet rollout is that Bezos is a businessman, first and foremost. In a December interview at The New York Times‘s DealBook Summit, he explained why he was more optimistic about Trump’s second term: “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I’m going to help him.” But if an interest in deregulation was all that animated Bezos’s enthusiasm, he probably wouldn’t have been so ostentatious in his support of the president and his policies. What’s more likely is that he made a cold calculation that an if-you-can’t-beat-‘em-join-‘em ethos and some financial support could neutralize the threat of Trump’s antagonism. If so, it was a critical miscalculation. Even if it weren’t obvious from Trump’s entire political life that loyalty is a one-way street, it should have been clear that he’d only view with contempt those who have suddenly decided to butter him up (“Everybody wants to be my friend,” Trump crowed in December, as business leaders including Bezos began to kiss the ring.) What is the hypothetical difference between where Bezos finds himself today—with the administration smearing Amazon as Chinese propagandists over a story that the company thoroughly denies—had he either opposed Trump or maintained an air of neutrality? There’s no way of knowing. Whatever it is, though, it’s probably a better position than Trump continuing to antagonize him while the anti-Trump crowd occasionally boycotts his company. Best of luck with the Melania doc, though.",

        "description": "Amazon's Project Kuiper offers strategic independence from Elon Musk's SpaceX and big potential profits in the satellite internet market. Jeff Bezos's Amazon isn't slowing down on Project Kuiper, which could challenge Elon Musk's Starlink.AP; Getty ImagesDespite deep cost cuts elsewhere, Amazon is still spending heavily on Project Kuiper satellites.SpaceX's Starlink offers a blueprint for Kuiper's financial potential.Amazon may also want strategic independence from Elon Musk.When Andy Jassy went on a post-COVID cost cutting spree, eliminating roughly 27,000 employees, I thought most of Amazon's risky moonshot projects would also get the chop.So, when Jassy didn't cut Project Kuiper, a bold plan to launch a constellation of internet-beaming satellites, I scratched my head. Of all Amazon's moonshots, this may be the most expensive. If the CEO wanted to quickly slash costs, nixing Kuiper would have been the play.Instead, Kuiper survived the purge — while others, like an AR headset for business meetings, were cut — and Amazon plowed ahead.That decision underscores two key drivers: massive profit potential and a desire for strategic independence from Elon Musk.The lure of Starlink-sized profitA SpaceX rocket launching Starlink satellites.Paul Hennessy/Getty ImagesIf there's any blueprint for Kuiper's financial upside, it's Starlink. SpaceX's satellite internet venture has rocketed ahead in recent years.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney recently shared estimates of Starlink's financials, citing Chris Quilty, an expert from the satellite and space industry. These are pretty mind-blowing numbers, especially for a service that was initially ridiculed as impractical and expensive when Musk announced it a decade ago:$12.3 billion in projected revenue for the 2025 fiscal year, up 57% from a year earlier.7.6 million subscriptions, an increase of 3 million subs from 2024.$7.5 billion in earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, a common measure of profitability known as EBITDA.61% EBITDA margin.And for those who dislike accounting gymnastics: $2 billion of free cash flow.Quilty also forecast that, at maturity, Starlink could reach 80% EBITDA margins.\"This suggests Kuiper could be a highly attractive business for Amazon at scale,\" ISI Evercore's Mahaney wrote in a recent note to investors.Recent investment rounds valued SpaceX at about $350 billion.Amazon has thin margins in its core e-commerce business, so Kuiper is a potential way to diversify into a more lucrative field. Mahaney noted that Kuiper is going after a $1 trillion total addressable market in terrestrial telecom and broadband services. Given that Amazon typically competes in ultra-low-margin sectors like e-commerce, the prospect of an 80% margin business is probably too good to ignore.If that's not enough of an incentive, here's another: There's only so much satellite communication spectrum up in space, especially the low-earth orbit areas where Starlink dominates. Because of this, Quilty reckons Kuiper is not only the closest challenger to Starlink — it will likely be the only significant competitor.Despite delays, Kuiper's launch of 27 satellites this week is a tangible step toward monetization. Amazon has also announced plans to sell Kuiper terminals for under $400, aiming for tens of millions of units, and is working toward a commercial service.A need for autonomyAn Amazon Project Kuiper launch.Associated PressBeyond these tantalizing profits, I think there's another strategic motive driving Amazon's satellite ambitions: It doesn't want to depend on Musk.Starlink's ability to beam internet service around the world, combined with SpaceX's unmatched launch capability, has made this company a potent geopolitical tool. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Starlink service to this war-torn area became so strategically important that the Pentagon had to negotiate directly with Musk to maintain internet communications there. This is the type of power that catches the attention of Big Tech companies that rely on the internet to reach customers. I can imagine the prospect of going through Elon to reach users might make most tech CEOs queasy.Reliable and strong internet access is especially important for Amazon. The company's cloud business, AWS, is the backbone of its profits, and it controls a growing share of global digital infrastructure. Relying on Starlink for some broadband access could be a major risk. The same Starlink terminals that provide residential internet also serve military and enterprise customers, including some that Amazon might wish to court.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been clear on this. While acknowledging Starlink's success, he has emphasized that demand for internet access is insatiable and leaves room for multiple winners. But underneath the diplomacy is a business logic that's impossible to ignore: Amazon needs its own highway to the cloud. Kuiper offers that.Moreover, by owning the infrastructure from space to server, Amazon can better control quality, pricing, and reach — especially in areas where terrestrial internet is unreliable. It also reduces geopolitical and commercial dependencies on third-party providers who might not share Amazon's priorities.Project Kuiper is far from a vanity play. It's a strategic moonshot aimed squarely at two objectives: unlocking a high-margin business with billion-dollar upside and insulating Amazon from dependence on an unpredictable rival.As Starlink proves the model and Amazon begins scaling Kuiper's constellation, this once-head-scratching bet is starting to look like a savvy move.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Tariff chaos continues for both manufacturers and retailers. This morning, Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering listing the cost of tariffs as a separate line item on its site, citing \"a person familiar with the plan.\" Amazon later acknowledged that there had been internal discussions to that effect but only for its import-focused Amazon Haul sub-store and that the company didn't plan to actually list tariff prices for any items. \"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" reads Amazon's two-sentence statement. Amazon issued such a specific and forceful on-the-record denial in part because it had drawn the ire of the Trump administration. In a press briefing early this morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked a question about the report, which the administration responded to as though Amazon had made a formal announcement about the policy.Read full article Comments",

Amazon says it has no plans to display import-related charges on its website following White House protests. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement provided to PYMNTS Tuesday (April 29). “This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Amazon had considered adding a line item to goods sold on Haul — the $20 or less discount store it launched last year — in response to President Donald Trump’s removal of the de minimis trade loophole, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. This plan was not related to Trump’s 145% tariff on imports from China, the source added. Another report, this one by Punchbowl News and also citing an unnamed source familiar with the discussions, said that Amazon would “soon” start displaying the cost of tariffs alongside the price of each product. This news prompted a harsh response from the Trump administration, which called Amazon’s reported plans a “hostile and political act.” “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked. After Amazon clarified its statement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wrote in an X post that this was a “good move.” A source told NBC News that Trump had called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos Tuesday to voice his displeasure with the Punchbowl report. The news came the same day as reports that Amazon was pushing its suppliers to reduce their prices in response to the ongoing tariffs. In other tariff-related news, concerns about the levies have caused consumer confidence to slip for the fifth month in a row, according to a report Tuesday by The Conference Board. Findings from the organization’s Consumer Confidence Index survey for April included consumers’ write-in responses, where mentions of tariffs hit an all-time high. The drop in consumer confidence was largely fueled by consumers’ expectations, as their view of current business and labor market conditions has “held up,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board, said in a new release. “The three expectation components — business conditions, employment prospects and future income — all deteriorated sharply, reflecting pervasive pessimism about the future,” she said.

        "description": "United Parcel Service (UPS) entered 2025 navigating the currents of a rapidly evolving logistics landscape. “We are focusing on controlling what we can control and executing our strategy to improve long-term profitability,” UPS CFO Brian Dykes told investors on Tuesday’s (April 29) first-quarter 2025 earnings call. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our […] The post UPS Shifts Strategy With Amazon Exit, SMB Push Amid Cost Cuts appeared first on PYMNTS.com. United Parcel Service (UPS) entered 2025 navigating the currents of a rapidly evolving logistics landscape. “We are focusing on controlling what we can control and executing our strategy to improve long-term profitability,” UPS CFO Brian Dykes told investors on Tuesday’s (April 29) first-quarter 2025 earnings call. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS,” CEO Carol Tomé added. The company plans to shutter 164 operations and close 73 buildings by the end of June. These closures are designed to eliminate redundant infrastructure and realign capacity with evolving demand patterns. Additionally, UPS expects to reduce operational hours by approximately 25 million and cut around 20,000 positions. While the closures represent a substantial reshaping of UPS’ footprint, executives emphasized that investments would continue in automation and technology to enhance throughput and reduce unit costs. “We’re modernizing,” said Chief Operating Officer Nando Cesarone. “Fewer facilities, but smarter facilities.” Another significant move is the acceleration of a planned volume reduction from Amazon, long a major customer. UPS now expects to slash Amazon package volume in its network by more than 50% by June 2026. The decision, per executives, reflects UPS’ pivot away from low-margin, high-volume accounts and toward more profitable business. Amazon’s insourcing of logistics has been an industry-wide headwind, and UPS’ proactive recalibration could be a prudent step toward margin expansion, even if it results in near-term revenue pressure. SMBs (small- to medium-sized businesses) now comprise 31.2% of total U.S. volume, the highest concentration in a decade, further diversifying UPS’ customer base away from major retailers. Read also: UPS Expands Digital Transformation With RFID and DAP Tech The Cost of Transformation and Repositioning UPS’ first-quarter results that showed both the challenges and strategic shifts reshaping the logistics giant as it seeks to redefine itself in a volatile global economy. Under its “Efficiency Reimagined” initiative, UPS is targeting $1 billion in savings in 2025, with broader restructuring efforts aiming for $3.5 billion in total cost reductions by year’s end. “The reconfiguration is not just about cutting costs,” said COO Cesarone. “It’s about ensuring our network is faster, more flexible and better matched to the types of volume we’re seeing and expect to see in the future.” U.S. domestic revenue rose 1.4% to $14.5 billion, driven largely by increases in air cargo and a 4.5% boost in revenue per piece (RPP) — the strongest RPP growth rate in eight quarters. However, average daily volume (ADV) fell by 3.5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting strategic shifts in customer mix and pricing. International operations provided a bright spot in volume growth but revealed pressure on margins. Revenue climbed 2.7% to $4.4 billion, supported by a 7.1% increase in average daily volume across top markets. However, non-GAAP operating profit fell 4.1%, reflecting a shift toward more economical services in Europe, weaker demand-related surcharges, and expansion investments such as weekend service offerings. UPS’ strategic overhaul comes against a backdrop of mounting external pressures, particularly the specter of shifting trade policies and tariff changes that could reverberate through global supply chains. The company is closely monitoring potential trade policy adjustments, especially in the U.S.-China corridor. International revenues are expected to decline about 2%, mainly due to weakening demand on China-to-U.S. lanes. See more: UPS to Expand Complex Healthcare Logistics Capabilities With Andlauer Acquisition New Strategic Initiatives Take Flight Amid the restructuring, UPS is rolling out new strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering its competitive position in the fiercely contested delivery market. The company recently launched the in-sourcing of SurePost Final Mile delivery, a move that brings what had traditionally been the U.S. Postal Service’s last-mile segment fully under UPS’ control. By taking over these deliveries directly, UPS hopes to improve reliability, speed and customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, UPS introduced Ground Saver, a new domestic economy shipping service targeted at cost-conscious customers. Ground Saver is designed to compete more aggressively with offerings from FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and a growing cadre of regional carriers. UPS also announced a pending acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group, which will bolster its healthcare logistics capabilities — a critical move as healthcare represents a growing share of global supply chain needs. While UPS’s outlook remains cautious, management is optimistic about emerging stronger from today’s turbulence. The transformation initiatives could significantly boost profitability, provided execution remains on track. Still, risks remain: global trade policy shifts, new tariffs, fluctuating fuel prices, labor dynamics and potential cyber threats could impact performance. Moreover, as UPS moves away from Amazon volumes — expected to decline by 25% over the course of 2025 — its success in growing SMB and healthcare segments will be critical to maintaining volume stability.

The first 27 operational satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network lifted off from Florida's Space Coast on Monday evening, the opening salvo in a challenge to SpaceX's dominant Starlink global Internet service. Amazon's Project Kuiper, costing up to $20 billion, will beam high-speed, low-latency broadband signals to consumers around the world. Monday's milestone launch kicks off a test campaign in low-Earth orbit to verify the functionality and performance of Amazon's satellites. In a statement earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to begin providing service to customers later this year. These initial services are likely to have limited reach.

Amazon is reportedly looking for steep supplier discounts to offset the cost of U.S. tariffs. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 29), the tech giant has asked for low double-digit price decreases from merchants in a range of categories, from homeware to consumer electronics. That’s according to a trio of vendor consultants who negotiate on behalf of brands and suppliers. They say Amazon has become more aggressive with suppliers getting goods from China in the wake of the White House’s 145% tariffs on China. “Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” Scott Miller, a consultant and former Amazon vendor manager, told the FT. “Brands have grown dependent on the platform and have little choice.” The FT notes that Amazon has joined competitors such as Costco and Walmart in leaning on suppliers to reduce the impact on its profits this year. Goldman Sachs analysts said the tariffs could shave between $5 billion and $10 billion from Amazon’s operating profits this year, depending on the outcome of the trade war. A number of logistics providers and analysts told the FT that Amazon had brought forward shipments after Trump took office in anticipation of increased tariffs. The company also canceled a significant amount of direct imports from China and had switched to purchasing goods from suppliers with American stock, according to two consultants. PYMNTS has contacted Amazon for comment but has not received a reply. The company told the FT it was “working with our broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the developing environment while maintaining low prices for customers.” The news follows reports from earlier this week that Amazon third-party vendors are choosing to skip this year’s Prime Day sales event due to the tariffs. Meanwhile, new research from PYMNTS Intelligence finds that in the battle between Amazon and rival Walmart, many consumers are opting to patronize both retailers. The research found that nearly a quarter of American adults hold subscriptions to Amazon and Walmart’s membership programs, nearly double 2021’s level. Dual memberships are even more pronounced among millennials, at almost 40%. “The enduring image of Walmart as mainly a grocer and purveyor of basic household goods — and of Amazon as the seller of everything else — is being subtly challenged by the rise of the kaleidoscope consumer seeking savings and satisfaction across both marketplaces, often simultaneously,” PYMNTS wrote in advance of the research.

        "description": "The first 27 satellites for Amazon’s Kuiper broadband internet constellation were launched into space from Florida on Monday, kicking off the long-delayed deployment of an internet-from-space network that will rival SpaceX’s Starlink. The satellites are the first of 3,236 that Amazon plans to send into low-Earth orbit for Project Kuiper, a $10 billion effort unveiled in 2019 to beam broadband internet globally for consumers, businesses and governments—customers that SpaceX has courted for years with its powerful Starlink business. Sitting atop an Atlas V rocket from the Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint-venture United Launch Alliance, the batch of 27 satellites was lofted into space at 7 p.m. EDT pm from the rocket company’s launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Bad weather scrubbed an initial launch attempt on April 9. Kuiper is arguably Amazon’s biggest bet under way, pitting it against Starlink as well as global telecommunications providers like AT&T and T-Mobile. The company has positioned the service as a boon to rural areas where connectivity is sparse or nonexistent. The mission to deploy the first operational satellites has been delayed more than a year—Amazon once hoped it could launch the inaugural batch in early 2024. The company faces a deadline set by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to deploy half its constellation, 1,618 satellites, by mid-2026, but its slower start means Amazon is likely to seek an extension, analysts say. Hours or possibly days after the launch, Amazon is expected to publicly confirm initial contact with all of the satellites from its mission operations center in Redmond, Washington. If all goes as planned, the company said it expects to “begin delivering service to customers later this year.” ULA could launch up to five more Kuiper missions this year, ULA CEO Tory Bruno told Reuters in an interview this month. Amazon said in a 2020 FCC filing that it could begin service in some northern and southern regions at 578 satellites, with coverage expanding toward Earth’s equator as the company launches more satellites. The Web services and e-commerce giant’s Project Kuiper is an ambitious foray into space, with a late start in a market dominated by SpaceX. But Amazon executives see the company’s deep consumer product experience and established cloud computing business that Kuiper will connect with as an edge over Starlink. Amazon launched two prototype satellites in 2023 in tests it said were successful, before de-orbiting them in 2024. It had been relatively quiet about the program’s development until announcing its first Kuiper launch plans earlier this month. ‘ROOM FOR LOTS OF WINNERS’ Elon Musk’s SpaceX, with a unique edge as both a satellite operator and launch company with its reusable Falcon 9, has put more than 8,000 Starlink satellites in orbit since 2019, marking its 250th dedicated Starlink launch on Monday. Its deployment pace has hastened to at least one Starlink mission per week, each rocket with roughly two-dozen satellites on board to expand the network’s bandwidth and replace outdated satellites. That quick pace has helped Musk’s company amass more than 5 million internet users across 125 countries, upend the global satellite communications market and woo military and intelligence agencies that have sought to use Starlink and its manufacturing line for sensitive national security programs. Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete with Starlink, telling Reuters in a January interview “there’s insatiable demand” for internet. “There’s room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well,” he said. “It will be a primarily commercial system, but there will be defense uses for these LEO constellations, no doubt,” he added, referring to low-Earth orbit. Amazon in 2023 revealed its Kuiper consumer terminals, an LP vinyl record-sized antenna that communicates with Kuiper satellites overhead, as well as a smaller terminal whose size it compares to its e-book Kindle device. The company expects to make tens of millions of the devices for under $400 each. Amazon in 2022 booked 83 rocket launches from ULA, France’s Arianespace and Blue Origin, Bezos’ space company, snagging the industry’s biggest-ever launch deal as it prepared to begin Kuiper deployment. —Joey Roulette, Reuters",

        "description": "Amazon just launched its first series of Kuiper internet satellites into space after a previous failed attempt due to unsuitable weather. The company shared how it was able to successfully launch 27 Kuiper satellites from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launchpad. This was located in Florida, a little after 7 pm Eastern time. They confirmed the breakthrough launch through a livestream event.The company shared during the livestream how the countdown went smoothly, the weather was perfect, and the liftoff was seamless. Now, Atlas V is making an orbit to take the 27 Kuiper satellites belonging to Amazon. Once that’s done and they are adjusting accurately, it would give rise to a new period of internet connectivity, it added.The satellites would be staying separate from a rocket that’s roughly 280 miles above the surface of the Earth, at which point Amazon would look to confirm their presence and maneuver independently and communicate with various employees located on the ground. Nearly six years ago, Amazon shared big plans to design a major constellation of internet-beaming satellites present in low Earth orbit, dubbed Project Kuiper. This kind of service would be competing in a direct manner with archrivals such as Elon Musk’s Starlink. Today, the latter dominates this area. It has about 8000 satellites currently in orbit as we speak.The initial Kuiper mission just kicked off a new era of launches for Amazon, which it needed to do to meet the deadline outlined by the FCC. The agency hopes the firm to have 50% of the total constellation in space by next summer. So as you can see, the competition is tough, but this might be the star that Amazon needed to reach its target.Right now, Amazon has more than 80 launches booked to roll out dozens of satellites over a certain period of time. Other than ULA, the launch partners entail Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the EU’s Arianespace, and Bezos’ space exploration startup, which is Blue Origin. Amazon allocated a massive investment worth $10 billion to design the entire Kuiper network. Through this system, it hopes to give rise to commercial services so consumers can benefit, as well as the government and other businesses.Amazon’s CEO shared this past month in a letter to shareholders how it would need a mega investment at the start, but with time, it hopes to generate more meaningful income and ROIC business. We’ll hear more about this after the company’s first quarter earnings report is shared on Thursday.

Instead, they're heading into their latest earnings season with a difficult task: addressing a Trump-led vibe shift that's been anything but kind to them.This week, several tech firms, including Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, report their latest earnings against a backdrop of uncertainty that sent their stocks plummeting and added pressure on them to deliver results on big bets like AI. Investors and CEOs started the year with very different expectations. They had hoped for a Trump bump from deregulation, the return of dealmaking, and an overall pro-growth agenda.\"We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad,\" Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said in an earnings call in January.Despite a market sell-off in January stemming from the release of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek, there appeared to be optimism among the Big Tech CEOs who had donated to Trump's presidential campaign, lined up behind him at his inauguration, and shared huge investment commitments collectively worth over $1 trillion to the US.Instead, they got tariffs and uncertainty. Tech company CEOs at Trump's inauguration.SHAWN THEW/via REUTERSBig Tech stocks have taken a beating The pain for Big Tech has been most evident in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff proposals this month, which raised fears about the long-term value of tech firms with supply chains and large customer bases in regions heavily targeted by tariffs, like China.Apple, for instance, has seen its share price fall by almost 14% this year as its reliance on a massive supply chain empire in China has been called into question. Amazon is down by nearly 15%. Microsoft is down by more than 6%, and Meta is down by more than 8%.The S&P 500 — the four Big Tech companies reporting earnings this week constitute roughly a fifth of its benchmark index — is down by over 6% since Trump's inauguration. Trillions of dollars have gone up in smoke.Hamish Low, an analyst at research firm Enders Analysis, told Business Insider that the \"macro uncertainty\" triggered in Trump's administration would weigh on tech companies.He said it would cause investors to be more serious about the \"questions that were already growing\" around Big Tech's major bets and their potential for returns, Low said. AI has been a huge talking point for tech CEOs, but none have yet been able to clearly indicate when returns might come on their massive capital expenditures.\"Impressive capabilities at the frontier of research aren't translating into either people's experiences of AI products, or the kinds of returns that match the investments going in,\" Low told BI.What may help offset some of the pain for these companies is that analysts have been lowering their expectations.In a poll of analysts, research firm FactSet found that the profits of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech firms are expected to rise 16% this year, down from around a 37% increase in 2024, according to figures first reported by The Wall Street Journal.In which case, CEOs might be able to breathe a sigh of relief as reality readjusts around them. But if the fallout from tech earnings already shared this season is any indication, they may not want to think twice about getting too relaxed.Speaking as Tesla reported disappointing earnings last week, Elon Musk, who emerged as a key figure in the early days of Trump's administration as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, made clear he will, from next month, be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla.\"Musk added that the \"tariff decision is entirely up to the president of the United States.\" Elon Musk will be focusing more time on Tesla as the company battles a sell-off.LEON NEAL/POOL/AFP via Getty ImagesTesla, which has a significant manufacturing presence in China, has seen its share price drop by almost 25% since the start of the year, even with a bounce after Musk said he'd step back from DOGE. Google, which reported earnings last week, also showed signs that Trump's policies had given it a headache. Addressing an investor question on tariffs, Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said, \"We're obviously not immune to the macro environment.\" Google's share price is down nearly 15% since the start of the year.

        "description": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang have lost a collective $192 billion in wealth since Inauguration Day.Win McNamee/Getty Images; Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images; Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images; Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSeveral tech billionaires attended or donated to Trump's inauguration in January.Four of the richest have lost a collective $194 billion in wealth since Trump took office.Tech leaders who attend Trump's inauguration have also seen declines in their company's share price.It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side.Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund. The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly.A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide.Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday.Elon MuskNet worth on January 20: $449 billionNet worth on April 28: $335 billionLoss: $114 billionMusk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person.Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year.After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government.Jeff BezosNet worth on January 20: $245 billionNet worth on April 28: $209 billionLoss: $36 billionBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February.Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country.Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site.Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk were among the tech leaders who supported Trump's inauguration.JULIA DEMAREE NIKHINSON/POOL/AFP via Getty ImagesMark ZuckerbergNet worth on January 20: $217 billionNet worth on April 28: $195 billionLoss: $22 billionZuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election. Trump had repeatedly lashed out against the Meta CEO on Truth Social and suggested he should be investigated or jailed after Facebook temporarily banned Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot.Meta, the primary source of Zuckerberg's wealth, has been fighting an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the government that has not gone away under Trump. Zuckerberg earlier this month sat for three days of testimony after the antitrust trial opened.The Meta CEO testified for more than 10 hours and was grilled by the FTC's lead attorney.Jensen HuangNet worth on January 20: $117 billionNet worth on April 28: $95.4 billionLoss: $21.6 billionWhile Huang did not attend the inauguration, Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural fund�. Huang's wealth, a majority of which is tied to Nvidia stock, has also dropped since January, when he attended the inauguration.Nvidia stock has fallen over 21% year to date, with the company facing several setbacks that include Trump's tariffs, as the company sources a majority of its chips from overseas, primarily Taiwan.The company also said earlier this month it expected to take a $5.5 billion hit on its first-quarter earnings as a result of the Trump administration's restrictions on its chip exports to China.Tech leaders also saw stock declines for the companies they leadOther tech leaders who attended the inauguration saw declines in the stock prices of the companies they lead, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.Though some estimates suggest the CEOs are billionaires, they are not on Bloomberg's list of the top 500 richest people, so the change in their estimated net worth since the inauguration was not publicly available.But Apple's share price has fallen nearly 14% this year, while the share price of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has fallen nearly 15% year over year.Read the original article on Business Insider Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang have lost a collective $192 billion in wealth since Inauguration Day.Win McNamee/Getty Images; Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images; Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images; Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSeveral tech billionaires attended or donated to Trump's inauguration in January.Four of the richest have lost a collective $194 billion in wealth since Trump took office.Tech leaders who attend Trump's inauguration have also seen declines in their company's share price.It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side.Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund. The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly.A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide.Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday.Elon MuskNet worth on January 20: $449 billionNet worth on April 28: $335 billionLoss: $114 billionMusk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person.Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year.After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government.Jeff BezosNet worth on January 20: $245 billionNet worth on April 28: $209 billionLoss: $36 billionBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February.Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country.Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site.Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk were among the tech leaders who supported Trump's inauguration.JULIA DEMAREE NIKHINSON/POOL/AFP via Getty ImagesMark ZuckerbergNet worth on January 20: $217 billionNet worth on April 28: $195 billionLoss: $22 billionZuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election.

For years, Amazon’s Prime Day has been a prime opportunity for the company’s third-party merchants. But amid an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods, some sellers are sitting out this year’s shopping event or scaling back their discounts, Reuters reported Monday (April 28). For example, Rick Sliter, CEO of pillow company MedCline, told Reuters he will likely hold back discounts on Prime Day — scheduled for July — even though his company saw sales seven times higher than normal during last year’s event. “Last year Prime Day was a no-brainer,” said Sliter. “But if tariffs continue, discounting gets thrown out the window.” Another merchant, bike and skateboard seller Steve Green, said he would be skipping Prime Day for the first time since 2020. He’s also holding back products he imported from China before the tariffs, with plans to sell them later at full price. The 145% tariffs will more than double his costs of goods on newly imported products, making it “unaffordable,” said Green. As Reuters notes, Prime Day has long been one of Amazon’s biggest yearly shopping events after Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with the company spending millions to promote the sale each year. The tariffs, said CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram, have placed Amazon in an awkward position as Prime Day approaches. “Amazon will be fine, but I do feel for some of the third-party sellers — they’re the ones that are going to be hurt the most in this environment,” Sundaram said. An Amazon spokesperson told Reuters the company is having a “strong response from selling partners to Prime Day 2025.” Interviewed by CNBC earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company’s third-party sellers are likely to try to pass the cost of tariffs on to shoppers. He added that Amazon is doing everything it can to keep prices as low as possible. “We’ve done some strategic forward inventory buys, to get as many items as makes sense for customers at lower prices,” Jassy said. “There are some cases where we have deals that were negotiated that weren’t done, where we’ll renegotiate terms to make it easier for customers to have lower prices.” And as reported here recently, both Amazon and rival Walmart are working on ways to overhaul their supply chains in response to the tariffs.

Millennials Will Take Both, Please appeared first on PYMNTS.com. The consumer retail landscape is usually painted in broad strokes of green and blue: Walmart for weekly groceries, beverages and basic household items, Amazon for everything from clothing and housewares to electronics and beauty products. But that picture is far more nuanced. A forthcoming report, “Winning Both Carts: Millennials Drive Surge in Having Amazon Prime and Walmart+ Subscriptions,” by PYMNTS Intelligence, suggests a growing shift in consumer behavior where shoppers increasingly frequent both retail behemoths and don’t stay tied to a single eCommerce marketplace. Think of blurred lines, not color-blocked division. Nearly one in four U.S. adult consumers now holds monthly subscriptions to both industry giants, almost double 2021’s level. Millennials in particular aren’t content to choose sides in the duopoly. Nearly four in 10, the most of any generational cohort, subscribe to both. Eight in 10 subscribe to just one of the retailers or both. Why the doubling down? The report suggests that many shoppers are engaged in a calculated pursuit of holistic pocketbook and lifestyle benefits that combine maximum savings, free shipping and streaming perks from Amazon with groceries and fuel discounts from Walmart+. Today’s digitally driven shopping is less about brand loyalty more about strategically straddling the green-blue divide. The report is based on a survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults that was conducted in early 2025 and reveals a new division of purchasing labor in the consumer psyche. Pocketbook Strategies While Amazon reigns supreme for nonessential, higher-ticket items, Walmart is expanding its territory in the realm of groceries, its core strength. Consider this: More than four in 10 dual subscribers last procured their groceries through Walmart+, while only a mere sliver, 4.1%, did so via Amazon. More than a third of millennials, now aged roughly 28–44, made their last grocery purchase at Walmart, compared to just 2.5% at Amazon. Even among Amazon Prime-only subscribers, a not-insignificant share made their most recent non-grocery retail purchase at Walmart. By contrast, Walmart+ subscribers rarely cross over to Amazon for groceries. Shoppers are making their dual memberships a strategic portfolio of purchases. But the embrace of both platforms doesn’t signify boundless spending. The report, which publishes on April 29, indicates that budget-conscious consumers — those living paycheck to paycheck — are more likely to subscribe to Walmart than to Amazon Prime. The green-blue division is blurred in other ways. More than one in four households living paycheck to paycheck while struggling to pay bills maintain dual subscriptions, a sign they see the value of combining retailer benefits when budgets are tight. Dual subscribers spend more money. While Walmart dominates grocery spending, dual subscribers shell out more on average per retail transaction at Amazon ($110) compared to Prime-only ($78) or Walmart+-only ($75) members. The signal: those subscribers may be value-conscious, but they’re also a significant driver of Amazon’s non-grocery revenue. Millennials, the vanguard of this dual subscription trend, particularly engage in this spending pattern. The narrative, then, shifts from a simple binary choice to a more intricate layering. Consumers aren’t just picking a side; they’re intentionally leveraging the strengths of each retail behemoth, creating a personalized consumption ecosystem of benefits and conveniences. The enduring image of Walmart as mainly a grocer and purveyor of basic household goods — and of Amazon as the seller of everything else — is being subtly challenged by the rise of the kaleidoscope consumer seeking savings and satisfaction across both marketplaces, often simultaneously.

Slate, a new EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, believes its new $25,000 pickup truck, which could cost less than $20,000 with tax credits, could help change that, its CEO, Chris Barman, told Business Insider.\"There's a massive population of people out there when it comes to safe, reliable, affordable transportation; there just really aren't many alternatives for them,\" Barman told us in an interview ahead of the unveiling of the new EV this week.A $25,000 price point would mean achieving something the current EV sales king, Tesla, has been unable to do.

Electric pickups are even more expensive, with prices exceeding $100,000 on models like the Ford F150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck.The Slate Truck, which comes standard with 150 miles of range, is expected to be the cheapest new electric vehicle and pickup truck in the US, staking out a spot in the market no truck — electric or otherwise — has been able to. According to Barman, the focus on simplicity and affordability drew her to Slate.\"I grew up on a farm.

        "description": "Many tech company CEOs attended Trump's inauguration, from Mark Zuckerberg to Jeff Bezos.SHAWN THEW/via REUTERSMany tech leaders tried to get close to Trump after the election, donating to his inaugural fund.One expert told BI that, since then, it's been a \"rocky road\" for Silicon Valley leaders and Trump.Here's where some of tech's big names — and businesses — stand with the president a few months in.Some of the biggest tech leaders tried to get in President Donald Trump's good graces before he took office for a second time, meeting with him at his Mar-a-Lago resort and snagging prime spots at Trump's inauguration.A few months into his presidency, many of those tech leaders are now dealing with tariffs and other disruptive policies, like immigration restrictions and funding cuts, that could impact their bottom lines. At the time of writing, Trump had exempted many electronics from the harshest levies on China and instead said they would be moved to a different tariff \"bucket\" in the future. Yet other tariffs have caused US CEOs to pause spending and hiring, and they could make it more expensive to build AI data centers.The stocks of all publicly listed companies included here have dropped since the inauguration, as has the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.Darrell West, a senior fellow in the Center for Technology Innovation at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said some of the tech leaders have \"probably been disappointed.\"\"The tech leaders had a buddy-buddy relationship with Trump early in the administration, but since then, it has been a rocky road,\" he said. Moving forward, he anticipates that tech leaders will still try to remain close to Trump, even if it doesn't guarantee returns.\"The fact that he meets with CEOs does not mean that he follows the advice they give him,\" he said.Here's where some of the biggest tech leaders — and their companies — stand with the president now.Representatives for Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon declined to comment to Business Insider. Representatives for the White House and other companies did not respond to a request for comment from BI.Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X, Boring Company, NeuralinkElon Musk has remained close to Trump but announced that he'll be stepping back from DOGE.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImageElon Musk spent at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the election, has influenced policy and personnel decisions, and is the face of the White House DOGE Office — for now.The world's richest man has remained close to the president in the months since, but his involvement in Washington seems to be waning. Americans are souring on his political involvement, according to public opinion polls, and he has been viewed by some as a political liability. During a Tesla earnings call in April, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from DOGE and devoting more time to Tesla.Tesla has suffered since Trump took office due to a widespread protest movement and plummeting sales. Musk has publicly criticized Trump's tariffs but said on the earnings call that Tesla is generally \"the least affected car company\" when it comes to levies. SpaceX could also benefit from new government contracts.Other than Tesla, Musk's companies are privately held.Mark Zuckerberg: MetaThe FTC is suing Mark Zuckerberg's Meta in a landmark anti-trust case.Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty ImagesMark Zuckerberg and Trump have a tumultuous history, but the Facebook founder has recently tried to patch things up. The Meta CEO called Trump a \"badass\" before the election and ended fact-checking on Meta platforms. The company donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.Court proceedings recently began in the Federal Trade Commission's blockbuster trial against Meta. The government is trying to force Meta to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the company operates as an illegal monopoly.

Amazon invested Rs 350 crore (about $41 million) into Amazon Pay India, the Economic Times reported Friday (April 25), citing regulatory filing with the Registrar of Companies. Amazon Pay was the eighth-largest Unified Payments Interface (UPI) player by transaction volume in March, and it’s looking to gain share from competitors like PhonePe and Google Pay, who have a combined market share of about 85%, according to the report. The company received a payment aggregator license from the Reserve Bank of India in February, giving a boost to its merchant payments business, and has also been approved for a prepaid payments instrument or wallet license, the report said. Amazon competes with other platforms in a variety of services, including bill payments, UPI transactions and insurance premium payments, per the report. It was reported in August that Amazon Pay was one of five payment firms that applied to join the Indian central bank’s digital currency pilot in order to enable eRupee transactions via their platforms. When the Reserve Bank of India launched the eRupee pilot program in December 2022, it permitted only banks to offer the digital currency through their mobile applications. But it expanded the program in April 2024 to include payment firms, once they are approved by the RBI. It was reported in June 2023 that Amazon planned to invest $26 billion in India by 2030. That report followed earlier announcements that Amazon Web Services was investing $12.9 billion in the country, and a $6.5 billion investment to boost its Indian eCommerce business. Digital wallets are the preferred payment method for 55% of retail purchases in India, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Cybersource collaboration, “2023 Global Digital Shopping Index: India Edition.” The report found that digital wallets were not only gaining traction in online retail purchases but also in brick-and-mortar stores. Indian merchants have recognized shoppers’ preferences and offer a range of digital shopping and payment features. Local merchants have excelled in providing a smooth digital shopping experience and earned a Global Digital Shopping Index (GDSI) score that is higher than merchants in any other country studied, except the UAE.

        "description": "Independent bookstores have long been champions of community, curiosity, and culture—and on Saturday, April 26, they get their moment in the spotlight. Independent Bookstore Day, a nationwide celebration of indie bookstores, invites readers to shop local and support the spaces that keep storytelling vibrant. But this year, the festivities come with a wrinkle: Amazon is holding a major book sale at the same time, and many booksellers and readers aren’t having it. Independent bookstores and users on “BookTok” are expressing their frustration with Amazon while encouraging readers to stay off of the online shopping site and instead make the trek to their local bookstore for the day. Some are even directly calling out Amazon and another large book retailer, Barnes and Noble, for having their sales so close to Independent Bookstore Day. “So if you didn’t know–and it’s okay if you didn’t because I feel like Amazon is working overtime to try and overshadow the whole day–this Saturday, April 26th, is Independent Bookstore Day,” TikTok user torithatnerd said in a video posted Thursday. Independent Bookstore Day began as California Bookstore Day in 2013 as a take on Record Store Day, according to Samantha Schoech in the Los Angeles Review of Books. Schoech wrote that it was a way for indie bookstores to ban together and encourage a celebration of all things independent bookstores have to offer the public. “Independent bookstores are not just stores, they’re community centers and locals anchors,” Schoech wrote. “They are entire universes of ideas that contain the possibility of real serendipity.” While the celebratory day started in California, sponsored by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, Schoech took the event nationwide in 2014. Soon after, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) began sponsoring the event, and this year, a record-breaking number of stores are participating. Over 1,600 bookstores from all 50 states plan to celebrate on Saturday. Protecting books in a digital age Andy Hunter is CEO and founder of bookshop.org, a website and business with a B Corp Certification that works to acknowledge and encourage the convenience of online shopping for books while still supporting local bookshops. On the website, customers choose a bookstore they’d like to support when buying books and the profits from orders are sent directly to the bookstore they selected. If customers opt to not choose a story, purchases contribute to a profit-sharing pool that helps all associated bookshops affiliated with bookshop.org. “Every independent bookstore is kind of an advocate and activist for the importance of ooks and reading in our society,” Hunter said. “So we want books to survive. We don’t want Amazon’s rise to be an extinction for local bookstores that are precious.” In April 2024, the ABA filed a motion to intervent in the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. The motion argues that Amazon has a monopoly power over books and can offer books at prices that independent bookstores find impossible to match. The motion, however, was eventually denied due to both the FTC and Amazon’s argument that ABA’s claims were distinct from the FTC’s allegations. For some BookTok-ers though, the timing of Amazon’s sale feels intentional. Though Amazon’s books may be cheaper than an average independent bookstore’s prices, influencers are still encouraging their followers to avoid Amazon, or even go to their local library if independent bookstores are too far out of their price range. “It feels like an intentional kick in the face to local bookstores,” Hunter said regarding the Amazon sale. “Independent bookstores generally have to charge full price because those margins are what help them survive. Amazon engages in predatory pricing.” Amazon denied these allegations. A spokesperson said, “The overlap was unintentional. The dates for our sale were set this year to accommodate additional participating countries.” Whether intentional or not, Amazon’s sale dates seem to be callously ignoring the importance of Independent Bookstore Day to Huner. “Books are really important, and they’re too important to society to entrust to a single retailer, whether or not that retailer has good intentions,” Hunter said. “Independent bookstores are fighting to keep an independent marketplace for books and ideas alive, and Independent Bookstore Day is a day that everybody who supports that effort, who wants a diverse ecosystem around books, shows their support.”",

Then, came the fun part: dropping heavy stuff on their creations.To test their prototypes' durability, the teens slammed them with a roll of tape, a stapler, a can of soda, and a metal water bottle — \"which did the most damage, but not as much as we thought it would,\" Clare said.They dropped each item onto the Kiriboard prototypes from various heights, so that they could calculate and study the physical forces of each impact.\"Basically, we want to see what's the most amount of force it can take before it snaps,\" Yao said.The results were promising, the trio said. The Kiriboard prototypes sustained very little damage, which they judged by checking the cardboard for dents. They plan to move forward with all four designs, which they hope will be useful for different types of shipping.A screenshot of the trio's design for Kiriboard packaging.Zhi Han (Anthony) Yao, Flint Mueller, James ClareIn the design pictured above, four triangular \"legs\" hold the Kiriboard in place inside a box.\"This middle section, we call it the matrix. This is supposed to be flexible,\" Yao said. Once you place an item for shipping inside the box, the matrix \"is supposed to form to the product.\"Once they've purchased a CNC router to automate cutting the cardboard, they plan to test prototypes by actually shipping them in boxes.\"Right now, we want to perfect our product,\" Yao said.When it's ready, they said they might also pitch it to the electronics company AndyMark, which shipped them the robotic motors that arrived broken.\"No shade to them,\" Clare said, adding that their robotics team frequently orders from AndyMark with no problems.\"We're on the brink of, like, this could become a reality, and it's just up to us to put in that final effort,\" Mueller said.

The […] The post What Amazon, Meta, Uber, Anthropic and Others Want in the US AI Action Plan appeared first on PYMNTS.com. As the White House finalizes its AI Action Plan, several tech giants, AI startups and even financial institutions are weighing in. Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Uber, CrowdStrike and JPMorgan Chase are among the thousands that have voiced their views on how the U.S. should regulate artificial intelligence (AI) for growth and innovation. The federal government released all of the comments Thursday (April 24) in a searchable database. OpenAI was one of the earlier submissions, calling for stronger export controls to China but less onerous ones for democratic countries, among other recommendations. Google irked entertainment industry creators and other workers by calling for fair use of copyrighted content — echoed by OpenAI — along with recommendations for government AI adoption. Overall, the submissions show several similarities — the need for infrastructure investment, open innovation and regulatory consistency to unify the patchwork of state laws — though they differ on approach. Read more: OpenAI Calls for Federal Government to Preempt State AI Laws Here’s a roundup of what tech giants, AI startups and other companies want from the Trump administration: Amazon Amazon is pushing for energy infrastructure investments, cloud and chip access, workforce development, federal AI adoption and setting interoperable international standards. Streamline energy regulations: Amazon said AI will require a lot of electricity to power. It advocates for streamlining nuclear power projects and transmission upgrades to keep the U.S. competitive. Lead global talks in AI: Amazon urges the White House to lead in AI efforts globally by promoting global regulatory interoperability through international standards for AI adoption. Educate the workforce in AI: Americans need to be educated on practical AI implementation not just advanced technical training, Amazon says, and the U.S. must invest in more advanced AI researchers and engineers while also enabling workers to use AI tools at work. Transform government agencies using AI: Amazon says federal agencies should leverage AI and the cloud to move away from legacy, on-premises data centers to transform their operations. Anthropic Anthropic projects that as early as late 2026, frontier AI systems may rival Nobel laureates in reasoning ability — and must be treated as national assets. Here are three key items on its wish list: AI threat testing: Anthropic is calling for building robust federal infrastructure for testing powerful models for risks in cybersecurity and development of biological weapons, among others. Strengthen chip export controls: The company supports new restrictions on advanced chips — including the currently exempt Nvidia H20 — and agreements with other countries to prevent smuggling. Energy for AI: Echoing Amazon, Anthropic projects that 50 gigawatts of additional power will be needed by 2027 just for U.S. AI developers. Monitor economic impacts of AI: The U.S. government should enhance its data collection mechanisms to better capture the economic fallout from wider AI adoption, as well as prepare for “significant” changes. Meta Meta’s Llama models are at the heart of its vision for open-source AI leadership and its recommendations to the U.S. government reflect this priority. Don’t stifle open source: Meta calls on the U.S. to resist pressure to regulate or restrict open AI models, warning that doing so would empower authoritarian regimes to fill the vacuum. Federal agency adoption: Meta urges the U.S. government to use open models wherever possible, arguing they are more secure, customizable and better for national security use cases. Fair use clarity: It wants an executive order clarifying that training AI on public data is fair use, which is crucial against copyright lawsuits. This reflects the stances of OpenAI and Google. State rules harm innovation: Meta is warning that fragmented state-level rules will raise compliance costs and stifle innovation. Microsoft Microsoft said the U.S. must stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence, noting that it is investing more than $50 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure in 2025. Enhance computational and energy resources: AI needs a lot of power and the software giant called for modernizing the electric grid, permitting data center construction and enhancing U.S. manufacturing of critical grid components and AI hardware. Access to high-quality data: The company wants to unlock government and other publicly funded data for AI training. Promote trust, safety and national security with AI: Microsoft supports laws targeting deepfake fraud, harnessing AI in defense, and to advance cybersecurity protection. Upskill the U.S. workforce: The company says government should lead national efforts to educate about AI and prepare them for future jobs that will be driven by an AI economy. Mistral AI France-based Mistral, with operations in Palo Alto, Calif., positioned itself as the startup champion for open-source innovation. Support open source: Like Meta, Mistral makes the case that transparency and public access to model weights improve research, security, and democratization of AI development. Weaken monopolies: Mistral advocates for antitrust enforcement, such as those brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to ensure startups and small- to medium-size businesses (SMBs) can compete against incumbents. Enhance global chip trade: Mistral said overregulating chips or AI exports could inadvertently shift innovation to other countries. Global AI cooperation: The firm wants the U.S. to strike a balance — protecting national security while encouraging multinational innovation partnerships that can be mutually beneficial. Uber The ride-hailing company said in its remarks that AI plays an increasingly important role in shaping mobility services. Uber has invested in robust AI governance to ensure accountability in decisions driven by AI. Avoid overregulating low-risk AI: Many mobility-related AI applications pose minimal risk and should not be burdened with complex new rules, Uber says. Stop patchwork of state rules: Uber urges federal preemption to eliminate the growing patchwork of inconsistent state AI laws. Use existing laws first: Current regulations on privacy, discrimination and consumer protection already address most AI-related risks, Uber says. Adopt a risk-based framework: The company says regulations should focus on high-risk use cases and boost innovation in less risky ones such as pricing. CrowdStrike CrowdStrike’s comments center on using and securing AI in the cybersecurity domain. Last year, the cybersecurity company botched an update that cause a global outage of Windows computers and servers. Focus on AI for cybersecurity: CrowdStrike says that the use of AI to detect cyber threats gives the U.S. an “enormous” advantage because it can defeat new threats based on behavior rather than known signatures. Regulation should not stifle innovation: New regulations on AI should not harm innovation and development of new technologies, the company says. Protect the models: The company calls for robust protections around the AI systems themselves and training data for resilience. JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan, which runs more than 500 AI and machine learning systems, calls for greater AI governance. Use existing frameworks: The bank argued that current banking regulations — such as model and third-party risk management, data governance, and privacy — are already well-suited to handle AI. Sector-specific regulation: JPMorgan supports a sector-by-sector approach, where existing financial regulators, such as the OCC or Federal Reserve, lead AI oversight for banks. Level the playing field: The bank wants non-banks offering financial services to be subject to the same standards, especially for AI in credit underwriting and fraud detection. Unify federal and state regulation: JPMorgan echoes the concerns of others about a patchwork of state laws, and calls for the federal government to preempt state laws.

Retail […] The post Amazon and Walmart Battle for the Hybrid Shopper appeared first on PYMNTS.com. As the digital and physical worlds of commerce continue to intertwine, Amazon and Walmart are reinventing themselves at a blistering pace. What was once a head-to-head contest for online supremacy has now evolved into a complex chess game, with both giants doubling down on logistics, artificial intelligence (AI), physical store innovation and customer experience. Retail Competition and Consumer Behavior Retail isn’t just about selling things anymore. It’s about being indispensable to your customer’s life. That’s the ongoing contest underway between Amazon and Walmart. But while it was once thought that shoppers would pick sides — particularly as it relates to retailer loyalty programs like Amazon Prime or Walmart+ — recent data is upending that narrative. According to the latest PYMNTS Intelligence report, the percentage of U.S. consumers holding both Amazon Prime and Walmart+ subscriptions has nearly doubled since 2021. Millennials are leading this charge, optimizing their digital lives by leveraging the perks, discounts and ultra-fast shipping offered by both memberships. This shift toward “multi-subscriber” behavior speaks volumes about today’s consumers: loyalty is increasingly transactional, driven by value, convenience and digital experience rather than long-standing brand allegiance. The report found that both Amazon and Walmart are responding with innovations designed to keep customers not just satisfied, but delighted. For Walmart, this has meant a radical acceleration of its logistics and delivery networks. In 2024, the company announced that its delivery footprint would soon cover 95% of U.S. households, powered by a mix of revamped fulfillment centers, smart geospatial technology and experimental last-mile solutions such as drone delivery, which has been piloted in Texas and other states. Physical stores are also being reimagined for a hybrid era. Walmart’s ambitious plan to remodel more than 650 locations this year, infusing them with the “Store of the Future” concept, is emblematic of the retailer’s commitment to omnichannel commerce. Modernized layouts, improved navigation and enhanced pickup/delivery integration aim to blur the lines between digital and physical retail. Walmart is not simply catching up to Amazon; it is setting the pace in certain areas, especially where its extensive physical footprint and knowledge of local markets confer unique advantages. Read more: Inside Amazon and Walmart’s Billion-Dollar Race to Win the Last Mile Infrastructure Expansion and Technological Investments Underpinning this battle for the customer are vast, often-invisible investments in infrastructure and technology. Even as economic turbulence introduces new variables, Amazon and Walmart are spending billions to build the future of commerce. Amazon’s recently revealed plans for a new 170,000-square-foot delivery facility in South Augusta, Georgia, are but one piece of a much larger puzzle. The company is on track to open approximately 80 new logistics facilities nationwide, as part of a $15 billion capital outlay aimed at maintaining its lead in fast delivery. These investments go beyond warehouses — they encompass advanced robotics, AI-powered sorting systems and the expansion of last-mile delivery capabilities. Walmart, meanwhile, is leveraging data and analytics to extend its delivery reach. The company’s use of geospatial data helps identify optimal locations for micro-fulfillment centers, allowing Walmart to cover nearly the entire U.S. population with next- or same-day delivery. This blending of digital intelligence and physical assets is central to Walmart’s evolving strategy. Technology innovation extends well beyond logistics. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud behemoth underpinning much of Amazon’s own retail empire (and that of countless third parties), continues to push the boundaries of AI and machine learning. The recent introduction of SWE-PolyBench — a multilingual benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents across dozens of programming languages — is emblematic of Amazon’s commitment to research and development in AI. The bottom line: retail giants are racing to marry physical scale with technological sophistication to secure their futures. Economic Challenges and Strategic Responses If building infrastructure and deploying technology were simply a matter of resources and ambition, the path forward might be straightforward. However, the current macroeconomic environment is anything but simple. Inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions and evolving consumer sentiment are forcing both Amazon and Walmart to make tough choices. Amazon’s decision to pause some data center leasing talks, particularly in international markets, is a sign of the times. As reported, the move reflects a new discipline around capital expenditure, especially amid shifting forecasts for cloud computing demand. While AWS remains highly profitable and a global leader, Amazon is signaling that even the largest tech firms must calibrate their expansion plans in response to economic headwinds. Tariff battles are adding yet another layer of complexity. The latest round of U.S.-China tariffs — some as high as 145% — is disrupting supply chains for critical technology components, from AI chips to robotics hardware. Walmart’s CEO met this week with President Donald Trump and the current administration to share concerns around the impact of the tariffs on business. The retailer is also doubling down on winning on cost, increasing its focus on discounts to drive demand and grow market share relative to competitors who may be less able to compete on cost amid macroeconomic uncertainty. On the digital front, AWS has introduced rate limits for certain AI services, citing the need for “fair access” rather than capacity constraints. This may seem like a minor technical adjustment, but it underscores a larger reality: as AI adoption soars, managing demand and ensuring equitable access to resources is becoming a strategic imperative. In this environment, adaptability is the ultimate asset. Companies that can pivot quickly — rebalancing investments, rerouting supply chains and scaling technologies — will emerge stronger. Those that cannot risk being left behind. Ultimately, for consumers, the future looks promising: the biggest companies in the world are competing to offer more choice, greater convenience and a seamless blend of physical and digital commerce. For Amazon and Walmart, the road ahead will be defined by their relentless competition, rapid innovation and the constant challenge of reinventing themselves before someone else takes their place.

        "description": "Owners can buy kits to add accessories and features to the Slate Truck. In one of the strangest launches we’ve seen in a while, Slate Auto, the reportedly Jeff Bezos-backed electric vehicle startup, unveiled its first EV, the Slate Truck. Notably, the vehicle is capable of a claimed 150 miles (241 km) of range at a starting price of less than $20,000, assuming federal clean vehicle tax credits continue to exist. Slate caused a lot of social media froth when it parked a pair of styling concepts (not functional vehicles) in Venice, California, advertising bizarre fake businesses. Today, the company unveiled the vehicle to the press at an event near the Long Beach Airport. You wanted a bare-bones EV? Here it is. The Blank Slate, as the company calls it, is \"all about accessible personalization\" and includes a \"flat-pack accessory SUV Kit\" that turns the truck from a pickup into a five-seat SUV and another that turns it into an \"open air\" truck. The aim, according to a spokesperson for Slate Auto, is to make the new vehicle repairable and customizable while adhering to safety and crash standards.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "A new auto startup is launching with a made-in-America EV that with federal tax credits will cost just $20,000. Backed by Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt, Slate Auto says that affordable price is possible because of its pared-down, basic model that can then be customized—and even transformed from a truck into an SUV.Slate Auto has been in stealth for almost three years, says CEO Chris Barman, who worked as a Chrysler executive until 2017. Based in Michigan, Slate spun out of Re:Build Manufacturing, a company cofounded by Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business. Slate purports to be “rekindling American industry” with a suite of U.S. industrial businesses, from batteries to composite manufacturing. (Barman is employee number two at Slate; the company now has more than 400 employees.)Recently, concept vehicles wrapped in ads for fake businesses began appearing on California streets. The company is officially launching today, with refundable vehicle reservations open now for $50. In recent days, the company has put some of its prototype vehicles on California streets, showcasing the possible configurations that will be available.“When baby drives you crazy, we drive them to sleep,” read one ad for a faux company called CryShare, wrapped around a two-door, boxy SUV. The included website, rockabyerides.com, went to a sign-up page that read “What’s a Slate? Be the first to find out.” Another vehicle with a hatchback cap was covered in ads for cat therapy sessions, and a third, a pickup truck, with ads for a fake human taxidermy service.[Photo: Slate]The unique marketing campaign was meant to be unlike any traditional vehicle unveiling. “We want to look at things very differently than what traditional automotive has done and what traditional automotive is providing to a consumer,” Barman says. That ethos also applies to the design of the Slate Truck, intended as a basic platform that can be accessorized by any customer.[Image: Slate]A blank slate The Slate Truck will begin as a two-door, two-seat electric pickup, with crank windows and no infotainment system. New cars today can come with lots of built-in features—large screens, heated seats, and so on—but to design Slate, Barman says, it was about “What are really the essentials that should go into a vehicle in order to bring it down to a price point that is affordable?”Customers will be able to be pick from more than 100 accessories to add on for an extra cost—everything from cup holders to a center console to a single roof crossbar to power windows. Since many people use their phones for music and navigation, the company eliminated the infotainment system to cut costs. Instead, there’s an accompanying app (at no charge) that drivers will be able to use when in the vehicle. If someone wants a radio in their Slate, it’s been designed so that one could be easily installed.Barman says Slate wants to change the typical process in which a buyer goes to a new- or used-car lot and picks a car, and then has to accept—and pay for—all the features it comes with. “We’ve decoupled that and said to the owner of the vehicle: ‘You choose. You choose if you want a radio. You choose if you want to have heated seats. You choose what you want the color to be,’” she says. “We are putting the power back into the hands of the consumer, so we give them this blank slate, and then they decide.” [Image: Slate]The Slate Truck will have exterior panels that are composite, rather than sheet metal. When using sheet metal, companies must have machines that stamp out the pieces; Slate’s composite panels will be made using injection molds. That means the company doesn’t have to invest in a stamping operation or a paint shop—which can run $400 million or more for automakers, Barman says. It also means the EV isn’t limited to a few colorways. Instead, drivers could put a wrap on it in any color they want. Slate envisions offering customers a wrap kit of die-cut pieces as well as instructional videos so they will be able to do it themselves (the Slate Truck was also designed without any external hardware so that wraps can be applied more easily). Or, the company will offer to prewrap the vehicle before delivery; it plans to have a network of partners in neighborhoods across the country that will be able to perform the installation for customers. (The wrapped vehicles that appeared with fake ads were a nod to this customization element.) [Image: Slate]Slate will offer two EV battery options: The standard comes with a range of 150 miles, but customers will be able to upgrade to a battery with an estimated 240 miles of range. The body of the EV will also be alterable, going from a two-door pickup to a five-seat SUV, with upgrades. Barman notes that customers could even do those changes over time, rather than when they first purchase the vehicle.“Maybe when [someone] first buys it, they’re single or just married, and after a few years they have a family, they can convert it,” she says. “And in doing that, it would cost them maybe $5,000 to make that change. But they don’t have to sell their vehicle and buy a completely new one. It’s a very cost-effective way to allow the vehicle to grow with them as their life changes.” [Image: Slate]Offering an affordable EV made in AmericaThose upgrades would add to the EV’s price. If a customer wants a longer-range battery, a wrap, and to turn the truck into an SUV, those adjustments would cost roughly $10,000. The basic version of the Slate Truck, after the federal EV tax credits are applied, comes to $20,000. “Our passion is this mission to bring an affordable vehicle to the market for the many people who felt that they didn’t have an alternative,” Barman says. Slate Auto raised at least $111 million in a Series A funding round in 2023 (under the name Re:Car), according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Bezos was among 16 investors in that round, TechCrunch previously reported, adding that Slate closed a Series B funding round last year but has yet to file the paperwork. Slate told Fast Company that the Walter Group, led by Mark Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, is also an investor.The EV tax credits offer a total of $7,500 back for vehicles that meet specific requirements like being manufactured in the U.S. Though President Trump has said he wants to get rid of the EV tax credits, they are currently still in place. Barman says Slate hopes they remain available to allow more individuals access to its EV. But if the federal credits do go away, she says, “We have a very affordable vehicle priced in the mid $20,000s, so it’s attractive and very competitive at that price point.” [Image: Slate]The average price of a new car purchased in the U.S. is above $49,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. The average price of a new EV is even higher, at $55,500. While markets like China have been able to build ultra-affordable EVs, some as low as $10,000, those options haven’t been available for car buyers in the U.S. (though automakers have said that they’re working on affordable options). With a $50,000 new car, consumers can expect a monthly payment of around $900, Barman says. Even used vehicles, at an average $27,000, can come with monthly payments that exceed $500. Consumers should aim to spend no more than 10% of their monthly take-home pay on car expenses, per Market Watch, but for a new $48,000 car, that means making at least $96,000 a year to afford the $800 monthly payment. In 2023, only 40% of U.S. households made more than $100,000. Barman says monthly payments for a Slate Truck will average $300 to $400.[Image: Slate]Slate Auto will build a factory somewhere in the Midwest, in order to be located near the automotive supply center, but it’s still assessing specific locations. “We really are focused on reindustrializing America,” Barman says. (Some car parts will still have to be purchased from abroad because they are not made domestically at all—like the manual window cranks.) Slate will sell direct to consumer through its website, and the truck will be delivered near customers’ homes; the company plans to set up a nationwide service network as well. Slate plans to bring its EV to market and into consumer hands by the fourth quarter of 2026.",

Global stock markets are heading to the cloud. Nasdaq and Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered to modernize the infrastructure of capital markets to help market operators transition to cloud-based systems while maintaining data sovereignty, according to a Thursday (April 24) press release. The key benefits are promoting greater global market interconnectivity, improving liquidity, and supporting innovation while ensuring compliance with local regulations, the release said. The Nasdaq-AWS collaboration seeks to provide market operators with flexible deployment options for cloud infrastructure, software and data management, per the release. The initiative supports cost-effective modernization without sacrificing the security or reliability required in financial markets. A suite of solutions is intended to address the increasing technological and regulatory complexities faced by exchanges and market participants worldwide, the release said. A central component of the suite is Nasdaq Eqlipse, a new brand encompassing “next-generation” marketplace technology solutions, according to the release. It’s a cloud-ready platform offering standardized APIs and data intelligence tools across the trade lifecycle. A key value proposition from using the platform is market operators can deploy artificial intelligence at scale to enhance data analytics and reporting capabilities specific to their workflows, per the release. John Kain, head of financial services market development for AWS, told PYMNTS in March that AWS is interested in using AI and agentic models. “AI has been such an integral part of how the industry has modernized over the last decade,” he said. The Nasdaq-AWS collaboration also offers a new services deployment model to assist market operators in reducing operational burdens and transformation risks, the press release said. The model is designed to help exchanges accelerate modernization efforts, improve time-to-market for new releases and enhance overall system resilience. The blueprint’s first adopters include Nasdaq’s Nordic markets, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and Mexico’s Grupo BMV, according to the release. Nasdaq’s Nordic markets plan to incorporate the managed infrastructure model, starting with derivatives, allowing clients to scale GPU usage and access cloud services from within Nasdaq’s data center in Sweden, per the release. For the JSE, the Nasdaq-AWS collaboration focuses on developing colocation — or the housing of privately owned servers and networking equipment in a third-party data center — data intelligence and client interaction services, the release said. The deployment model will drive operational efficiency by using edge computing and exploring AI-driven solutions. Grupo BMV is evaluating the deployment model’s potential to strengthen its clearing and central securities depository platforms and support adopting emerging technologies within the Mexican financial sector.

        "description": "Amazon is doubling down on off-site checkout, bringing its signature Prime benefits to more direct-to-consumer brands through international platforms like Shopline. Amazon is accelerating efforts to extend its signature Prime benefits to more direct-to-consumer brands beyond its own marketplace. Its latest move involves a new partnership with e-commerce software provider Shopline, which will allow thousands of brands — many based outside the U.S. — to offer Buy With Prime directly on their websites. The deal marks a significant step in Amazon’s ongoing effort to push Buy With Prime — a feature that lets shoppers check out on brand websites using their Amazon credentials and enjoy Prime shipping benefits — as a default infrastructure for global online commerce. For Amazon, the partnership lets the e-commerce giant assert more control over e-commerce logistics when a sale doesn’t happen on Amazon.com. This is a member-exclusive article from Modern Retail.

Fitbit makes some of our favorites, with plenty of options for different preferences and price points. Plus, if you've been wanting to try one for yourself, two of our favorite models, the Fitbit Inspire 3 and Fitbit Charge 6, are on sale now at Amazon.Our tech experts on the Reviews Team have tested all of the best Fitbits on the market, and the Inspire 3 is our favorite budget option.

It also has a larger screen than the Inspire 3, allowing you to monitor your health and fitness data more easily.With both Fitbit models having hundreds of five-star reviews, Amazon shoppers are clearly big fans. \"This tracker was exactly what I needed—super easy to use and does the basics well. I mainly use it for heart rate during workouts and tracking calories burned,\" said one Inspire 3 reviewer. \"It's small, lightweight, and the color is so cute! Great choice if you want something simple and reliable without all of the extras. It's easy to set up and connect. Anyone can do it.\"\"The charge lasts a long time, which means more data since you're not taking it off daily to charge. Heart rate monitoring is continuous and the simple display allows you to focus on specific health data,\" said a Charge 6 reviewer. \"Love the sleep data too! Also, it has a true sleep mode that doesn't light up at all at night…Overall, the Charge 6 is super lightweight, comfortable, and good quality!

Last year, Amazon launched Project Greenland, a \"centralized GPU orchestration platform,\" to more efficiently allocate GPU capacity across the company. It also pushed for tighter controls by prioritizing return-on-investment for each AI chip.As a result, Amazon is no longer facing a GPU crunch, which strained the company last year.\"Amazon has ample GPU capacity to continue innovating for our retail business and other customers across the company,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI. \"AWS recognized early on that generative AI innovations are fueling rapid adoption of cloud computing services for all our customers, including Amazon, and we quickly evaluated our customers' growing GPU needs and took steps to deliver the capacity they need to drive innovation.\"How Amazon decides who gets GPUsHere are the 8 tenets for GPU allocation, according to the internal Amazon document:ROI + High Judgment thinking is required for GPU usage prioritization. GPUs are too valuable to be given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, distribution should be determined based on ROI layered with common sense considerations, and provide for the long-term growth of the Company's free cash flow. Distribution can happen in bespoke infrastructure or in hours of a sharing/pooling tool.Continuously learn, assess, and improve: We solicit new ideas based on continuous review and are willing to improve our approach as we learn more.Avoid silo decisions: Avoid making decisions in isolation; instead, centralize the tracking of GPUs and GPU related initiatives in one place.Time is critical: Scalable tooling is a key to moving fast when making distribution decisions which, in turn, allows more time for innovation and learning from our experiences.Efficiency feeds innovation: Efficiency paves the way for innovation by encouraging optimal resource utilization, fostering collaboration and resource sharing.Embrace risk in the pursuit of innovation: Acceptable level of risk tolerance will allow to embrace the idea of 'failing fast' and maintain an environment conducive to Research and Development.Transparency and confidentiality: We encourage transparency around the GPU allocation methodology through education and updates on the wiki's while applying confidentiality around sensitive information on R&D and ROI sharable with only limited stakeholders. We celebrate wins and share lessons learned broadly.GPUs previously given to fleets may be recalled if other initiatives show more value.

Distribution can happen in bespoke infrastructure or in hours of a sharing/pooling tool.Continuously learn, assess, and improve: We solicit new ideas based on continuous review and are willing to improve our approach as we learn more.Avoid silo decisions: Avoid making decisions in isolation; instead, centralize the tracking of GPUs and GPU related initiatives in one place.Time is critical: Scalable tooling is a key to moving fast when making distribution decisions which, in turn, allows more time for innovation and learning from our experiences.Efficiency feeds innovation: Efficiency paves the way for innovation by encouraging optimal resource utilization, fostering collaboration and resource sharing.Embrace risk in the pursuit of innovation: Acceptable level of risk tolerance will allow to embrace the idea of 'failing fast' and maintain an environment conducive to Research and Development.Transparency and confidentiality: We encourage transparency around the GPU allocation methodology through education and updates on the wiki's while applying confidentiality around sensitive information on R&D and ROI sharable with only limited stakeholders. We celebrate wins and share lessons learned broadly.GPUs previously given to fleets may be recalled if other initiatives show more value.

        "description": "Lee Ann Million has worked at Amazon for nearly 14 years as an executive assistant. Because of the RTO push, her last day at the company is April 30. Mark Lennihan/Associated PressLee Ann Million has been an executive assistant at Amazon since 2011 and has worked remotely for nine years.Due to Amazon's return-to-office policy, Million has been told that her last day is April 30.She said she isn't leaving voluntarily and feels like she's being fired despite excellent performance.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Ann Million, a 64-year-old executive assistant at Amazon of nearly 14 years who lives in northern Michigan. Business Insider has verified Million's employment history. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I've been an executive assistant at Amazon since 2011. In June, I would've celebrated my 14th year.My role is to get the leaders I work for where they need to be — a meeting, a country, whatever — as quickly and as efficiently as I can. I handle their calendars, manage their projects, track their goals, and wrangle their teams. The relationship between an EA and the leader they work for is one of the most critical to how an organization operates.I worked in virtual roles for seven years before the RTO push started in February 2023, so my manager at the time and I didn't think the mandate would have any impact on me.Instead, after receiving two remote work exceptions, April 30 will be my last day at Amazon.I'm not leaving voluntarily; as far as I'm concerned, they're firing me. I'm a good employee. My performance review this year said I significantly exceeded expectations. I've given the company 100% of myself for 14 years; to have to leave is demoralizing and perplexing.I loved working at Amazon — then RTO happenedI love how you can reinvent yourself at Amazon. I've had the chance to have a bunch of different careers and get exposure to many different teams. When I started, I worked out of Seattle HQ for five years on the Kindle Fire launch team. In my first three months, it felt like all I did was run around — it was a great, electric time to be at Amazon.In 2016, my oldest daughter became ill, and I needed to move to Indiana to be closer to family. Soon after that, I was able to start working virtually and was successful at doing so.When three-day RTO was announced in February 2023, I found a house in Michigan and had to submit a change of address request. My request was rejected immediately because of RTO, and my HR rep instructed me to complete a remote work exception form.My manager, who's also a virtual employee, and I went back and forth with HR to explain that I was already a virtual employee, but we still filled out the form.I offered to work out of the Chicago office to stay on my team, since I have family there, but I was only given the option to move to Seattle or Washington, D.C., which wasn't feasible for me.In November 2023, my change of address request was approved by the VP of my organization — with the caveat that I retire in August 2024.It felt completely out of the blue. I was like, \"Who said anything about retiring?\" Retire is a very ageist word. After several more conversations with HR in July 2024 — a month before I was supposed to leave — they ended up extending my remote work exception until April 30 of this year.When I realized the end was coming, I thought they could at least bridge the gapI kept thinking somebody would change things. I've even tried to find other virtual roles within Amazon. There was one role that felt like it was made for me: It was fully virtual, and they were looking for someone with a lot of soft skills and relationship-building strengths, which I've been recognized for in the past. I had several informational chats, but then they went dark on me.Earlier this year, I realized, Oh my God, I'm a few months away and no one's intervening on my behalf.I thought that maybe Amazon could at least bridge the 11-month gap until I turn 65 next year and become eligible for Medicare.In my view, it'd be like a severance package, allowing me to delay taking my Social Security and maintain my insurance without having to pay for COBRA. I also have 38 shares of stock that vest in May and 37 shares that vest in November.In February, I tried emailing an Amazon HR executive to ask about bridging the gap. It's not unusual for Amazon employees to reach out to leaders directly.I was hurt and disappointed that she never replied to my email, though another HR staff member reached out and extended my termination date to June 1. The last day I'll work will still be April 30, giving me an additional month of salary, two months of insurance, and my 38 shares of stock that vest in May.My adult daughter is disabled, and Amazon has kept her on my insurance past the age of 26, which I'm forever grateful for. Losing my insurance in two months is what scares me more than anything.Amazon has been very good to me. But I just find it cold-hearted, in the grand scheme of things, for them not to bridge the 11-month gap for someone who's been there for 14 years, to get me to Medicare and give my daughter a little more time. I also won't get my 37 shares that would vest in November.I'll have to accept a permanent reduction in my monthly Social Security payment since I'm taking it out earlier than planned. I'm waiting on my final estimate from the Social Security Administration, but as of today, it looks like it'll be almost $600 less than if I worked until I was 67.Amazon didn't used to be this cold; something has changed. There are so many good things about Amazon, and it's sad that this is how it's playing out.Retirement wasn't on my radarI've always worked and supported my three daughters as a single mom, and I still help them. When my income stops, then my ability to help them — especially my disabled daughter — stops too. As long as I could work virtually, my plan was to keep going; retirement really wasn't on my radar.I'm fortunate that I love what I do. I just wish I could keep doing it. You can love your company and not the decisions that are being made; that's kind of how I feel.Sticking my head in the sand isn't a plan, so I've got to figure something out. I think my age is absolutely going to play a factor — I'm a 14-year high-performing employee and can't even get Amazon to hire me into another role. So I'm not optimistic about finding a role like this one externally.More than anything, I need to nurture myself a little bit. I'm healthy and can work. If I need to go work at the grocery store or at McDonald's or something, that's fine. I'll figure it out.A spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement: \"Ms. Million's alleged experience doesn't represent the experiences of the vast majority of employees at the company. And while we don't normally share details about an individual's situation, because Ms. Million's account lacks important details and context, we're compelled to share some facts to ensure the record is accurate. We informed Ms. Million in 2023 that we'd be asking her to relocate and join her colleagues in working from the office, and we worked with her directly to address her specific requests over the years — including extending her virtual location exception on three separate occasions. We continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant, and when in-person accommodations are needed, we provide them.\"Have a story or tip?

        "description": "Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman.AmazonWall Street analysts say Amazon has paused some data center deals.The data center market may be slightly cooling, after a frenzied couple of years.Microsoft has also taken its foot off the AI accelerator a bit recently.First, it was Microsoft. Now Amazon is raising eyebrows on Wall Street as fresh signs suggest the cloud giant may be easing off the accelerator in the race to build AI data centers.Some analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud provider, may be entering a digestion phase that could slow momentum in the data center market.The speculation gained traction Monday when famed short-seller Jim Chanos posted on X with a simple and ominous remark, alongside an analyst note suggesting caution around AWS's data center plans.Data Centers #UhOh pic.twitter.com/fRWNFxMV58— James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) April 21, 2025That note, published by Wells Fargo analysts, cited industry sources who reported this weekend that AWS paused discussions for certain new colocation data center deals, particularly international ones. The analysts stressed that the scale of the pause remains unclear, though they're worried.\"It does appear like the hyperscalers are being more discerning with leasing large clusters of power, and tightening up pre-lease windows for capacity that will be delivered before the end of 2026,\" the analysts wrote.Oh no, coloThe same day, TD Cowen analysts published similar findings from their own data center research.\"Our most recent checks point to a pullback in US colocation deals from Amazon,\" they wrote in a note to investors. Colo deals, as they're known in the industry, involve different companies sharing space in the same data center.\"We are aware of select colocation deals that it walked away from, as well as expansion options that it chose not to exercise,\" the Cowen analysts added.They also said that their recent industry checks point to a slowdown in Amazon's AI ambitions in Europe.\"This is a dynamic we will continue to monitor,\" the analysts wrote.Three signs of moderationMore broadly, Cowen's analysts have spotted a cooling in the data center market — relative to the frenzied activity of recent years.\"We observed a moderation in the exuberance around the outlook for hyperscale demand which characterized the market this time last year,\" they wrote, laying out three specific signs of calmer times:Data center demand has moderated a bit, particularly in Europe.There has been a broader moderation in the urgency and speed with which cloud companies seek to secure data center capacity.The number of large deals in the market appears to have moderated.Some context is important here. The AI data center market has gone gangbusters ever since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022 and showed the potential of generative AI technology.These signs of moderation are pretty small in relation to this huge trend. However, trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving.Microsoft made similar movesThese signals from Amazon echo similar moves by Microsoft, which recently halted some data center projects.\"Like Microsoft, AWS seems to be digesting recent aggressive leasing activity,\" the Wells Fargo analysts wrote.They clarified that this doesn't mean signed deals are being canceled, but rather that AWS is pulling back from early-stage agreements like Letters of Intent or Statements of Qualifications—common ways that cloud providers work with partners to prepare for data center projects.Amazon says it still sees strong AI demandIn response to these growing concerns, Kevin Miller, vice president of Global Data Centers at AWS, posted on LinkedIn on Monday to offer some clarity.\"We continue to see strong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS,\" he wrote.He explained that AWS has thousands of cloud customers around the world and must weigh multiple solutions to get them the right capacity at the right time.\"Some options might end up costing too much, while others might not deliver when we need the capacity,\" Miller wrote. \"Other times, we find that we need more capacity in one location and less in another. This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans.\"Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Digestion or indigestion?Miller's comments aim to position the pause not as a red flag, but as part of the normal ebb and flow of data center growth.Historically, these digestion periods, marked by slowing new leases or deferred builds, can last 6 to 12 months before a rebound, the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Google, for instance, pulled back from leasing in the second half of 2024, only to return aggressively in early 2025, they noted.The Cowen analysts said Amazon's recent cautious moves to pull back on colocation deals may be related to efforts to increase efficiency across its data center operations. Also, AWS typically doesn't do a lot of colocation deals anyway, preferring instead to build its own data centers, the analysts wrote.They also wrote that other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, are still aggressively pursuing new capacity.The bottom line? While AWS appears to be taking a breath, the AI cloud race is far from over. Analysts and investors will watch closely to see whether this pause marks a brief recalibration or a more significant shift in AI strategy.Read the original article on Business Insider Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman.AmazonWall Street analysts say Amazon has paused some data center deals.The data center market may be slightly cooling, after a frenzied couple of years.Microsoft has also taken its foot off the AI accelerator a bit recently.First, it was Microsoft. Now Amazon is raising eyebrows on Wall Street as fresh signs suggest the cloud giant may be easing off the accelerator in the race to build AI data centers.Some analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud provider, may be entering a digestion phase that could slow momentum in the data center market.The speculation gained traction Monday when famed short-seller Jim Chanos posted on X with a simple and ominous remark, alongside an analyst note suggesting caution around AWS's data center plans.Data Centers #UhOh pic.twitter.com/fRWNFxMV58— James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) April 21, 2025That note, published by Wells Fargo analysts, cited industry sources who reported this weekend that AWS paused discussions for certain new colocation data center deals, particularly international ones. The analysts stressed that the scale of the pause remains unclear, though they're worried.\"It does appear like the hyperscalers are being more discerning with leasing large clusters of power, and tightening up pre-lease windows for capacity that will be delivered before the end of 2026,\" the analysts wrote.Oh no, coloThe same day, TD Cowen analysts published similar findings from their own data center research.\"Our most recent checks point to a pullback in US colocation deals from Amazon,\" they wrote in a note to investors. Colo deals, as they're known in the industry, involve different companies sharing space in the same data center.\"We are aware of select colocation deals that it walked away from, as well as expansion options that it chose not to exercise,\" the Cowen analysts added.They also said that their recent industry checks point to a slowdown in Amazon's AI ambitions in Europe.\"This is a dynamic we will continue to monitor,\" the analysts wrote.Three signs of moderationMore broadly, Cowen's analysts have spotted a cooling in the data center market — relative to the frenzied activity of recent years.\"We observed a moderation in the exuberance around the outlook for hyperscale demand which characterized the market this time last year,\" they wrote, laying out three specific signs of calmer times:Data center demand has moderated a bit, particularly in Europe.There has been a broader moderation in the urgency and speed with which cloud companies seek to secure data center capacity.The number of large deals in the market appears to have moderated.Some context is important here. The AI data center market has gone gangbusters ever since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022 and showed the potential of generative AI technology.These signs of moderation are pretty small in relation to this huge trend. However, trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving.Microsoft made similar movesThese signals from Amazon echo similar moves by Microsoft, which recently halted some data center projects.\"Like Microsoft, AWS seems to be digesting recent aggressive leasing activity,\" the Wells Fargo analysts wrote.They clarified that this doesn't mean signed deals are being canceled, but rather that AWS is pulling back from early-stage agreements like Letters of Intent or Statements of Qualifications—common ways that cloud providers work with partners to prepare for data center projects.Amazon says it still sees strong AI demandIn response to these growing concerns, Kevin Miller, vice president of Global Data Centers at AWS, posted on LinkedIn on Monday to offer some clarity.\"We continue to see strong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS,\" he wrote.He explained that AWS has thousands of cloud customers around the world and must weigh multiple solutions to get them the right capacity at the right time.\"Some options might end up costing too much, while others might not deliver when we need the capacity,\" Miller wrote. \"Other times, we find that we need more capacity in one location and less in another.",

        "description": "Amazon tells advertisers to go all in on its platform during economic uncertainty. When the economy wobbles, most marketers ease off the gas. Amazon is telling them to floor it — on its ads, naturally. It’s a predictable pitch from a media owner. But Amazon isn’t just any seller of ad space. It can draw a straight line from impression to impact — be it a sale or a sentiment shift. That’s compelling in any climate but especially when every marketing dollar has to prove its worth.

AWS and Microsoft are pausing or slowing down the development of data centers, according to a Wells Fargo research note shared with PYMNTS. Several industry sources told Wells Fargo’s analysts team that AWS has “paused a portion of its leading discussions” on colocated data centers, particularly those abroad. “It’s not clear the magnitude of the pause, but the positioning is similar to what we’ve heard recently from Microsoft,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Eric Luebchow in the Monday (April 21) note. Last week, Noelle Walsh, president of Microsoft Cloud Operations and Innovation, disclosed in a LinkedIn post that the software giant is “slowing or pausing some early-stage projects” as it refines the buildout of cloud capacity relative to customer demand. Microsoft has doubled its data center capacity in the last three years and is on track to spend the budgeted amount of $80 billion or more in 2025 “informed by near-term and long-term demand signals,” Walsh said in the post. Microsoft has more than 350 data centers in at least 60 regions globally. Meanwhile, Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, explained in a LinkedIn post that the change in the hyperscaler’s data center plans is “routine capacity management, and there haven’t been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans.” AWS continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads,” he said in the post. Wells Fargo’s Luebchow acknowledged that “it’s not clear yet” that AWS’ slowing of lease signing “is an area of concern or just the natural ebbs and flows of hyperscale activity.” AWS has 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. Read also: Nvidia and xAI Sign On to $30 Billion AI Infrastructure Fund Other Hyperscalers Remain Active Luebchow said other major data center owners — Meta, Google and Oracle — remain “active” while Nvidia is showing “elevated activity.” This does not include the $500 billion Stargate project to build artificial intelligence data centers, which is a partnership among OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX, plus technical alliances with other companies, the analyst said. It also does not include Apple’s own data center plans, which are ramping up over the next four years, according to the research note. The surge in data center construction is the result of explosive growth in AI, cloud services and digital infrastructure needs. The demand for AI tools like ChatGPT is driving a need for massive computing power and storage, which means the necessity for more data centers. Global data center capacity is expected to grow at 15% per year until 2027, which is forecast to be insufficient to meet growing demand, according to real estate services company JLL. Driven by AI advancements, “global data center construction currently stands at record levels,” JLL said in its 2025 Global Data Center Outlook. “All signals suggest that AI demand will continue to build momentum in 2025.” However, the experience of China is a cautionary tale. After ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November 2022, there was a rush of data center buildout in China as growing demand for AI made the country seem like a sound bet, MIT Technology Review reported in March. In 2023 and 2024, more than 500 new data center projects were announced in China. At least 150 were operational by the end of last year, per the report. But the rise of DeepSeek, which offered a more economical way to train and use AI models, along with faltering economics around AI, is putting a crimp on the industry, according to the report. Many data centers also were constructed hastily and did not meet industry standards. The result is that most of the companies running these data centers are “struggling to stay afloat,” the report said. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Daniil Dubov/Getty, Tyler Le/BIGPU shortages delayed projects in Amazon's retail division last year.The company created a more efficient approval and monitoring process for internal GPU requests.Amazon says it now has \"ample\" GPU capacity across the company.Last year, Amazon's huge retail business had a big problem: It couldn't get enough AI chips to get crucial work done.With projects getting delayed, the Western world's largest e-commerce operation launched a radical revamp of internal processes and technology to tackle the issue, according to a trove of Amazon documents obtained by Business Insider.The initiative offers a rare inside look at how a tech giant balances internal demand for these GPU components with supply from Nvidia and other industry sources.Early in 2024, the generative AI boom was in full swing, with thousands of companies vying for access to the infrastructure needed to apply this powerful new technology.Inside Amazon, some employees went months without securing GPUs, leading to delays that disrupted timely project launches across the company's retail division, a sector that spans its e-commerce platform and expansive logistics operations, according to the internal documents.In July, Amazon launched Project Greenland, a \"centralized GPU capacity pool\" to better manage and allocate its limited GPU supply. The company also tightened approval protocols for internal GPU use, the documents show.\"GPUs are too valuable to be given out on a first-come, first-served basis,\" one of the Amazon guidelines stated. \"Instead, distribution should be determined based on ROI layered with common sense considerations, and provide for the long-term growth of the Company's free cash flow.\"Two years into a global shortage, GPUs remain a scarce commodity —even for some of the largest AI companies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for example, said in February that the ChatGPT-maker was \"out of GPUs,\" following a new model launch. Nvidia, the dominant GPU provider, has said it will be supply-constrained this year.However, Amazon's efforts to tackle this problem may be paying off. By December, internal forecasts suggested the crunch would ease this year, with chip availability expected to improve, the documents showed.In an email to BI, an Amazon spokesperson said the company's retail arm, which sources GPUs through Amazon Web Services, now has full access to the AI processors.\"Amazon has ample GPU capacity to continue innovating for our retail business and other customers across the company,\" the spokesperson said. \"AWS recognized early on that generative AI innovations are fueling rapid adoption of cloud computing services for all our customers, including Amazon, and we quickly evaluated our customers' growing GPU needs and took steps to deliver the capacity they need to drive innovation.\"\"Shovel-ready\"Amazon CEO Andy JassyAmazonAmazon now demands hard data and return-on-investment proof for every internal GPU request, according to the documents obtained by BI.Initiatives are \"prioritized and ranked\" for GPU allocation based on several factors, including the completeness of data provided and the financial benefit per GPU. Projects must be \"shovel-ready,\" or approved for development, and prove they are in a competitive \"race to market.\" They also have to provide a timeline for when actual benefits will be realized.One internal document from late 2024 stated that Amazon's retail unit planned to distribute GPUs to the \"next highest priority initiatives\" as more supply became available in the first quarter of 2025.The broader priority for Amazon's retail business is to ensure its cloud infrastructure spending generates the \"highest return on investment through revenue growth or cost-to-serve reduction,\" one of the documents added.Amazon's new GPU \"tenets\"Amazon's retail team codified its approach into official \"tenets\" — internal guidelines that individual teams or projects create for faster decision-making. The tenets emphasize strong ROI, selective approvals, and a push for speed and efficiency.And if a greenlit project underdelivers, its GPUs can be pulled back.Here are the 8 tenets for GPU allocation, according to one of the Amazon documents:ROl + High Judgment thinking is required for GPU usage prioritization. GPUs are too valuable to be given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, distribution should be determined based on ROl layered with common sense considerations, and provide for the long-term growth of the Company's free cash flow. Distribution can happen in bespoke infrastructure or in hours of a sharing/pooling tool.Continuously learn, assess, and improve: We solicit new ideas based on continuous review and are willing to improve our approach as we learn more.Avoid silo decisions: Avoid making decisions in isolation; instead, centralize the tracking of GPUs and GPU related initiatives in one place.Time is critical: Scalable tooling is a key to moving fast when making distribution decisions which, in turn, allows more time for innovation and learning from our experiences.Efficiency feeds innovation: Efficiency paves the way for innovation by encouraging optimal resource utilization, fostering collaboration and resource sharing.Embrace risk in the pursuit of innovation: Acceptable level of risk tolerance will allow to embrace the idea of 'failing fast' and maintain an environment conducive to Research and Development.Transparency and confidentiality: We encourage transparency around the GPU allocation methodology through education and updates on the wiki's while applying confidentiality around sensitive information on R&D and ROI sharable with only limited stakeholders. We celebrate wins and share lessons learned broadly.GPUs previously given to fleets may be recalled if other initiatives show more value. Having a GPU doesn't mean you'll get to keep it.Project GreenlandAWS CEO Matt GarmanAmazonTo address the complexity of managing GPU supply and demand, Amazon launched a new project called Greenland last year.Greenland is described as a \"centralized GPU orchestration platform to share GPU capacity across teams and maximize utilization,\" one of the documents said.It can track GPU usage per initiative, share idle servers, and implement \"clawbacks\" to reallocate chips to more urgent projects, the documents explained. The system also offers a simplified networking setup and security updates, while alerting employees and leaders to projects with low GPU usage.This year, Amazon employees are \"mandated\" to go through Greenland to obtain GPU capacity for \"all future demands,\" and the company expects this to increase efficiency by \"reducing idle capacity and optimizing cluster utilization,\" it added.$1 billion investment in AI-related projectsAmazon's retail business is wasting no time putting its GPUs to work. One document listed more than 160 AI-powered initiatives, including the Rufus shopping assistant and Theia product image generator.Other AI projects in the works include, per the document:A vision-assisted package retrieval (VAPR) service that uses computer-vision technology to help drivers quickly identify and pick the correct packages from vans at delivery stops.A service that automatically pulls in data from external websites to create consistent product information.A new AI model that optimizes driver routing and package handling to reduce delivery times and improve efficiency.An improved customer service agent that uses natural language to address customer return inquiries.A service that automates seller fraud investigations and verifies document compliance.Last year, Amazon estimated that AI investments by its retail business indirectly contributed $2.5 billion in operating profits, the documents showed. Those investments also resulted in approximately $670 million in variable cost savings.It's unclear what the 2025 estimates are for those metrics. But Amazon plans to continue spending heavily on AI.As of early this year, Amazon's retail arm anticipated about $1 billion in investments for GPU-powered AI projects. Overall, the retail division expects to spend around $5.7 billion on AWS cloud infrastructure in 2025, up from $4.5 billion in 2024, the internal documents show.Improving capacityLast year, Amazon's heavy slate of AI projects put pressure on its GPU supply.Throughout the second half of 2024, Amazon's retail unit suffered a supply shortage of more than 1,000 P5 instances, AWS's cloud server that contains up to 8 Nvidia H100 GPUs, said one of the documents from December. The P5 shortage was expected to slightly improve by early this year, and turn to a surplus later in 2025, according to those December estimates.Amazon's spokesperson told BI those estimates are now \"outdated,\" and there's currently no GPU shortage.AWS's in-house AI chip Trainium was also projected to satisfy the retail division's demand by the end of 2025, but \"not sooner,\" one of the documents said.Amazon's improving capacity aligns with Andy Jassy's remarks from February, when he said the GPU and server constraints would \"relax\" by the second half of this year.But even with these efforts, there are signs that Amazon still worries about GPU supply.A recent job listing from the Greenland team acknowledged that explosive growth in GPU demand has become this generation's defining challenge: \"How do we get more GPU capacity?\"Do you work at Amazon?

AWS is reportedly facing criticism over the limits it places on customers’ use of Anthropic’s artificial intelligence (AI) models. The limits are “arbitrary” and suggest the AWS doesn’t have enough server capacity or is reserving some of it for large customers, The Information said Monday (April 21) in a report that cited four AWS customers and two consulting firms who customers use AWS. Some customers using AWS’ Bedrock application programming interface (API) service have seen error messages with growing frequency over the past year and a half, according to the report. The report also quoted an AWS enterprise customer that said it hasn’t experienced any constraints. AWS Senior PR Manager, Emerging Tech Kate Vorys told The Information that the company has tens of thousands of customers using Anthropic models through Bedrock and that the rate limits in Bedrock ensure customers can get “fair access” to AI models. “The Information’s suggestion that rate limits are a response to capacity constraints, or that Amazon Bedrock is not equipped to support customers’ needs, is false,” Vorys said, per the report. AWS launched Bedrock in April 2023, saying the service gives customers access to foundation models developed by AWS and other companies so they can choose the model that it best suited to their needs and use it to build their own generative AI application. In September 2023, Amazon said it planned to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic as part of a larger collaboration between the two companies. The partnership would see Anthropic use chips from AWS, make AWS its primary cloud provider for “mission-critical workloads” and offer AWS customers access to its future generations of its foundation models. In November, Amazon and Anthropic announced an expanded partnership that included Amazon investing another $4 billion in the AI company — bringing its total investment in Anthropic to $8 billion — and Anthropic making AWS its primary training partner. In February, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy described AI as “the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet,” adding that the company was doubling down on AI investments with a $26 billion capital expenditure for Q4 2024 dedicated to developing AI capabilities for AWS and an expectation to keep that level of spending consistent throughout 2025.

        "description": "An analysis by Vidpros of 34 platforms revealed notable drops in popularity for several apps since 2021.The analysis found that a video-sharing app called JOSH lost the most popularity since 2021, with a 71.08% decline. It was somewhat a replacement of TikTok after it was banned in India. There were 31,120 average monthly searches of the app in 2022, with a peak of 48,350 in 2022, but it declined to only 9,000 monthly searches in 2025. The second app, which saw a huge decrease in its popularity, was Likee, with a decline of 58.96% since 2021. It's owned by a Singaporean tech firm with 409,400 monthly average searches in 2021. In 2025, the average monthly searches of Likee dropped to 168,000 while it had 150 million monthly active users at its peak. Facebook is the most well-known and popular app, but its popularity has also declined by 42.81% since 2021. In 2021, Meta's Facebook was searched 1,080,600,000 times but the figure dropped to 618,000,000 in 2025. \"Facebook’s monthly active users have stayed consistent over the years, but the sharp decline in searches suggests that its demographic is aging and becoming less attractive to younger, newer users who instead use other forms of social media to communicate.\", explained Michael Holmes, founder of Vidpros in an email to Digital Information World.QZone saw a 42.18% decline while Twitch saw a 32.14% decline since 2021. In 2021, QZone was searched 23,260 times a month, while its monthly searches dropped to 13,450 in 2025. On the other hand, Twitch is now being searched 37,200,000 times monthly in 2024, while it was searched 54,820,000 times a month in 2021. The monthly active streamers on Twitch also went from 9.89 million in 2021 to 7.23 million in 2024. There was a 32.06% decline in Facebook Messenger and a 22.90% decline in Discord in popularity. Other top ten apps which have seen a decline in their popularity are Line (16.72%), WeChat (14.68%), and Weibo (12.98%).Commenting on the findings, Michael Holmes, founder of Vidpros said, \"A 2024 Gartner report predicted that by the end of 2025, half of consumers will abandon or significantly limit their interactions with social media. While it’s unclear whether this will be the case yet, what is clear is that there’s been a definite change between what consumers used to want from social media and what they want now.\" Adding further, \"Apps focused on content creation and creativity, such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest, all saw a rise in searches, however, messaging services like WeChat, Messenger, Viber, and Skype, all experienced decreases. This shift from traditional social media uses to more visual apps suggests that users are now prioritizing entertainment over communication.\"Methodology: This study ranks social media platforms with at least 100 million active users by their change in global Google searches from 2021 to 2025, utilizing monthly search volume data from Google Keyword Planner.Read next:• Instagram and Facebook Users See Fewer Friend Posts as Meta Defends Itself in Court• Marketers Embrace AI: 85% Use Tools, 70% See Efficiency Gains, and 50% Save Over 5 Hours Weekly",

Netflix seems to be flexible on the format and wants the creator to be active in developing it, three people said.Netflix already streams some competition shows, including \"Squid Game: The Challenge.\" On the romance front, it's garnered massive success with shows such as \"Love Is Blind.\"Two people familiar with Netflix's outreach in the creator space also said the streamer is interested in live concepts.Its most recent foray into the live space, \"Pop The Balloon\" — an adaptation of a YouTube dating series — was met with lukewarm reviews.

        "description": "If you’ve been thinking about skipping that Target run this weekend, you’re not alone. A grassroots group called The People’s Union USA is asking shoppers to sit out spending money at major retailers, restaurants, and banks from midnight on Good Friday through Easter Sunday. “No shopping, no spending, no fueling the corporate machine that has been bleeding us dry,” organizer John Schwarz said in a video posted to Instagram. The goal? Hit big brands where it hurts—their bottom line. The boycott follows weeks of frustration over corporate DEI rollbacks and rising political tension, especially with companies such as Target, which has been the focus of a separate 40-day boycott led by faith leaders during Lent. As a result of its DEI policy changes, Target has been the target of a boycott organized by faith leaders for the last 40 days, coinciding with Lent. On January 24, Target announced that it was getting rid of policies concerning hiring goals for minority employees, an executive committee focused on racial justice, and other changes to its diversity initiative. According to a report from Numerator, more than one in 10 customers surveyed on April 16 plan to participate in the boycott, though this move is less well-known than the widespread “economic blackout” that took place on February 28. Furthermore, not all participants are planning to fully stop their spending for the weekend, though many plan on avoiding large corporations, including the brands Target, Walmart, Amazon, McDonald’s, and Starbucks. Half of all participants are shifting their dollars to local, small businesses instead. Users on X and Bluesky sounded off, reposting The People’s Union’s post and reminding users to take stock of what matters. “Money anxiety is on everyone’s mind this week between taxes and tariffs,” the CataLIST posted. “Take back control by consciously choosing how and where you spend your money.” This Blackout is the second widespread boycott organized by The People’s Union. The first occurred on February 28, and the same report from Numerator said that although sales and trips were down across retailers, Amazon, Target, and Walmart saw declines beyond standard weekly variation. Black and LGBTQ+ consumers showed the most significant participation in the February 28 blackout. Many of these boycotts cite brands’ DEI pullbacks and policy changes at the behest of the new administration. Though blackouts and boycotts already have scheduled dates in the future, Target is attempting to fix its relationship with its consumer base as the 40-day “Lent” spending fast comes to a close. On April 17, Target CEO Brian Cornell met with Rev. Al Sharpton, head of the civil rights organization National Action Network, to discuss DEI and racial justice. Sharpton called the meeting “constructive and candid,” and plans to meet with some members of the National Action Network board of directors to determine next steps with Target. Whether or not the boycott makes a measurable dent in sales this weekend, organizers say it’s about more than just the money—it’s about sending a message.",

        "description": "Agility's Digit robot works inside a warehouse.Agility RoboticsRobots that look and move like humans are getting a lot of buzz.Companies, including Amazon and GXO, are already testing humanoid robots in their warehouses.But humanoids are expensive and complex, and the tech used to power them is still nascent.Tech companies and investors are pouring billions of dollars into a future in which human-like robots work alongside people in warehouses, hospitals, restaurants, and homes. The goal is that humanoid robots that can carry objects and walk on two feet could help to fill labor shortages across industries and take on tasks that might be harmful to humans.While the idea of having a robot do chores around the house might sound appealing, humanoids most often start their \"careers\" in warehouses and manufacturing facilities.That's because humanoids — and robots in general — tend to work best in structured environments, CB Insights' senior lead analyst Benjamin Lawrence told Business Insider.\"A lot of factories and warehouses are very similar, so you can set up replicating tasks much more easily,\" he said. \"When you think of a home, for example, you need to make sure that the humanoid is safe with grandma, with the kids, with the pets, that it doesn't step on the dog's tail. You need to make sure that the humanoid is aware that there's a candle burning on that table and doesn't accidentally knock it over and cause a house fire.\"Some experts are skeptical about a future filled with humanoid robots. They're expensive and complex to manufacture, and outside a handful of highly publicized tests, they're still largely unproven.But investor interest is taking off, with companies making humanoid robots raising a collective $1.2 billion in venture funding in 2024, according to CB Insights. The sector is on track to more than double funding to $3 billion this year. Agility Robotics is raising $400 million at a $1.75 billion valuation, The Information reported earlier this month. Apptronik, which makes the Apollo humanoid robot, announced a $350 million Series A funding round in February.Big Tech companies are also betting big on humanoids — some by supplying their foundational models to robotics manufacturers, like Google DeepMind is doing with Apptronik, and others by making both the models and the hardware themselves, like Tesla is with its Optimus robot. Big Tech views humanoids as the natural next step in AI, as the industry's interest has gone from generative AI to agentic AI and then on to physical AI. Advances in natural language processing have also made training robots simpler.\"The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during his keynote speech at CES in January.'We're not 10 years away, that's for sure'Many of the early users of humanoids are auto manufacturers. There's already quite a bit of automation in car plants, so moving on to humanoids is a natural progression, Lawrence said.Ford was Agility's first customer, buying the first two Digit robots in 2020. The two companies had previously partnered on a last-mile delivery project. Elon Musk has said Tesla will have \"genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use\" this year and available to other companies at a price tag of $20,000 to $30,000 in 2026. BMW piloted humanoid robots made by Figure, using them to insert sheet metal parts into a car's chassis. And, Hyundai acquired Boston Dynamics, a leader in humanoid robotics, from Softbank for $1.1 billion in 2021.Retailers are also testing humanoids in their warehouses. Amazon is testing Digit, the humanoid robot made by Agility, in addition to the robots it manufactures in-house. Logistics giant GXO is also testing Digit and humanoids from Apptronik and Reflex Robotics.Reflex's humanoid robot is working with a sports apparel customer of GXO. GXOGXO\"We are going really broad and aggressive on the category,\" Adrian Stoch, GXO's chief automation officer Adrian Stoch told BI in a recent interview. \"It's because of where we see this going.\"Just how close humanoid coworkers are to becoming a reality in warehouses is still uncertain.There are a few roadblocks. The first is price, with a single humanoid robot costing several tens of thousands of dollars (though several manufacturers in China, including Unitree, have recently revealed models at a significantly lower price point).The second potential roadblock is the technology itself.\"You need to have humanoids that are highly adaptable to every different warehouse, to a range of language commands, and to be able to infer those commands and work within the existing structure,\" Lawrence said. \"It's just very difficult to do that.\"The current tests are relatively small. For example, GXO has more than 1,000 warehouses and employs more than 150,000 people, yet it has just two Digit units moving heavy boxes to a conveyor belt in one facility.\"We're not at wide-scale deployment and commercial viability yet, but we're not 10 years away, that's for sure,\" Stoch said.When is the human form right for the job?There's also the question of whether robots that can walk on two feet and manipulate objects with two hands are ideal for completing tasks.Robotic arms that can pick up and place items are now common in warehouses. There are also automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, that transport items around warehouses using predefined routes on a line or wire, and autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs, that can get around on their own. Boston Dynamics has also made a robotic dog that can do things like read meters and detect leaks.\"There are very few use cases where the best robotic form is something that looks like you,\" Forrester analyst Paul Miller said.He added that the work a human does could likely best be replicated with a combination of technologies, not just a robot that happens to have a similar look to a human.\"A human worker in their job does a lot of different tasks. Some of those tasks are best performed by a human being. Some tasks are best performed by software,\" Miller said. \"Some of those tasks are best performed by a physical automation, some kind of robot.\"\"It's about working out how you break those tasks up.\"Have a tip?

In environments like today’s, reactive operations might as well be useless ones. By the time they take effect, it is often already too late. As the news this week from both Amazon and Walmart spotlight, against the backdrop of today’s dynamic landscape, innovation must become hardwired into logistics and payments infrastructures in response to geopolitical and trade headwinds, technological acceleration and evolving consumer expectations. Retail and Logistics Expansion Walmart and Amazon are both doubling down on logistics, signaling a critical shift in how delivery infrastructure is viewed. No longer a cost center, it’s now a competitive differentiator. Earlier this week, Walmart announced an expansion of its delivery network that will add 12 million more U.S. households to its service coverage. This leap is driven by a data-first approach, leveraging customer insights and AI to predict demand patterns and dynamically adjust fulfillment strategies. The move supports Walmart’s broader omnichannel vision, where convenience is paramount and friction is the enemy. Not to be outdone, Amazon has unveiled a sweeping $15 billion investment to expand its U.S. logistics footprint. This includes up to 80 new warehouses and a further pivot into transportation with the addition of less-than-truckload (LTL) services for inbound shipments to its fulfillment centers. For a company already known for its delivery dominance, the initiative underscores Amazon’s intent to make speed and control even more central to its value proposition. Technological Innovations in Retail At the core of Amazon’s operational revamp is a deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across customer-facing and back-end functions. CEO Andy Jassy recently noted that the company is working on more than 1,000 GenAI applications spanning shopping recommendations, product reviews and internal efficiencies. Amazon’s robotics division is a particular focal point. From automated sortation to adaptive robotics, the aim is to streamline warehouse operations while improving worker safety. Robotics vice president Joseph Quinlivan described it as “building an entirely new culture of automation,” one where machine intelligence augments human potential. However, even as retail giants embrace AI and expand logistics, they must navigate the complex web of global trade policy. New tariffs on Chinese goods are disrupting long-established supply chains and forcing hard decisions on pricing and procurement. Impact of Tariffs on eCommerce and Consumer Cost Amazon, for instance, has begun surveying its third-party sellers to assess the impact of tariffs on their businesses. CEO Jassy has acknowledged that consumers may bear the brunt of these costs, as sellers recalibrate to protect margins. These pressures are being felt across the eCommerce spectrum. Fast-fashion platforms Shein and Temu are preparing to raise U.S. prices following the removal of the de minimis exemption, which had previously allowed them to avoid certain import duties. With tariffs now biting at the heart of price-sensitive retail categories, some businesses are introducing explicit fees to offset new costs. This changing economic landscape is driving innovation in payments, where the mandate is clear: reduce friction and preserve value for both merchants and consumers. According to recent data from PYMNTS Intelligence, more than half of U.S. consumers now prefer digital wallets over traditional payment methods — a trend that shows no sign of slowing. As inflation and trade policy reshape pricing strategies, seamless digital payments are becoming an essential buffer, helping to maintain customer satisfaction even as costs rise. Digital wallets also offer merchants a crucial source of data. With each tap, businesses gain insights into purchase behavior, enabling more precise marketing, inventory planning and loyalty rewards. In a high-stakes environment where every basis point matters, these marginal gains can drive meaningful competitive advantage. Looking Ahead The convergence of AI, logistics and payments is creating a new operating system for retail — one built for speed, adaptability and customer intimacy. For Walmart, Amazon and others at the vanguard, the strategy is not just about keeping up with change. It’s about steering into it, designing business models that thrive under complexity. Retailers must harmonize AI tools with tariff strategies, payments innovations with logistics frameworks. The winners will be those who don’t just optimize the system, but reimagine it entirely. In this moment of flux, the message is clear: the future of commerce won’t be delivered in a box — it will be built from the ground up, across networks, algorithms, and increasingly, from the wallets in our pockets.

Pushed by trackmobile railcar movers, the Atlas V rocket rolled to the launch pad last week with a full load of 27 satellites for Amazon's Kuiper internet megaconstellation. Credit: United Launch Alliance Last week, the first operational satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper broadband network were minutes from launch at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. These spacecraft, buttoned up on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, are the first of more than 3,200 mass-produced satellites Amazon plans to launch over the rest of the decade to deploy the first direct US competitor to SpaceX's Starlink internet network. However, as is often the case on Florida's Space Coast, bad weather prevented the satellites from launching April 9. No big deal, right? Anyone who pays close attention to the launch industry knows delays are part of the business. A broken component on the rocket, a summertime thunderstorm, or high winds can thwart a launch attempt.

Andrew Waber, director of market research at Momentum Commerce, a consulting company that manages online sales for brands including Crocs, Lego and Clorox, shared Amazon sales data that suggests consumers are stockpiling goods in several non-seasonal categories.

It lent urgency to a problem that Parimal Kopardekar, director of the NASA Aeronautics Research Institute,… On Thanksgiving weekend of 2013, Jeff Bezos, then Amazon’s CEO, took to 60 Minutes to make a stunning announcement: Amazon was a few years away from deploying drones that would deliver packages to homes in less than 30 minutes. It lent urgency to a problem that Parimal Kopardekar, director of the NASA Aeronautics Research Institute, had begun thinking about earlier that year. “How do you manage and accommodate large-scale drone operations without overloading the air traffic control system?” Kopardekar, who goes by PK, recalls wondering. Busy managing all airplane takeoffs and landings, air traffic controllers clearly wouldn’t have the capacity to oversee the fleets of package-delivering drones Amazon was promising. The solution PK devised, which subsequently grew into a collaboration between federal agencies, researchers, and industry, is a system called unmanned-­aircraft-system traffic management, or UTM. Instead of verbally communicating with air traffic controllers, drone operators using UTM share their intended flight paths with each other via a cloud-based network. This highly scalable approach may finally open the skies to a host of commercial drone applications that have yet to materialize. Amazon Prime Air launched in 2022 but was put on hold after crashes at a testing facility, for example. On any given day, only 8,500 or so unmanned aircraft fly in US airspace, the vast majority of which are used for recreational purposes rather than for services like search and rescue missions, real estate inspections, video surveillance, or farmland surveys. One obstacle to wider use has been concern over possible midair drone-to-drone collisions. (Drones are typically restricted to airspace below 400 feet and their access to airports is limited, which significantly lowers the risk of drone-airplane collisions.) Under Federal Aviation Administration regulations, drones generally cannot fly beyond an operator’s visual line of sight, limiting flights to about a third of a mile. This prevents most collisions but also most use cases, such as delivering medication to a patient’s doorstep or dispatching a police drone to an active crime scene so first responders can better prepare before arriving. Now, though, drone operators are increasingly incorporating UTM into their flights. The system uses path planning algorithms, like those that run in Google Maps, to chart a course that considers not only weather and obstacles like buildings and trees but the flight paths of nearby drones. It’ll automatically reroute a flight before takeoff if another drone has reserved the same volume of airspace at the same time, making the new flight trajectory visible to subsequent pilots. Drones can then fly autonomously to and from their destination, and no air traffic controller is required. Over the past decade, NASA and industry have demonstrated to the FAA through a series of tests that drones can safely maneuver around each other by adhering to UTM. And last summer, the agency gave the go-ahead for multiple drone delivery companies using UTM to begin flying simultaneously in the same airspace above Dallas—a first in US aviation history. Drone operators without in-house UTM capabilities have also begun licensing UTM services from FAA-approved third-party providers. UTM only works if all participants abide by the same rules and agree to share data, and it’s enabled a level of collaboration unusual for companies competing to gain a foothold in a young, hot field, notes Peter Sachs, head of airspace integration strategy at Zipline, a drone delivery company based in South San Francisco that’s approved to use UTM. “We all agree that we need to collaborate on the practical, behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts to make sure that this preflight deconfliction for drones works really well,” Sachs says. (“Strategic deconfliction” is the technical term for processes that minimize drone-drone collisions.) Zipline and the drone delivery companies Wing, Flytrex, and DroneUp all operate in the Dallas area and are racing to expand to more cities, yet they disclose where they’re flying to one another in the interest of keeping the airspace conflict-free. Greater adoption of UTM may be on the way. The FAA is expected to soon release a new rule called Part 108 that may allow operators to fly beyond visual line of sight if, among other requirements, they have some UTM capability, eliminating the need for the difficult-­to-obtain waiver the agency currently requires for these flights. To safely manage this additional drone traffic, drone companies will have to continue working together to keep their aircraft out of each other’s way.

Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and KuCoin temporarily suspended withdrawals Tuesday (April 15) morning. As CoinDesk reported, the issue stemmed from the companies’ data center provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). “We are aware of an issue impacting some services on the #Binance platform due to a temporary network interruption in the AWS data center,” Binance said in an X post. According to the CoinDesk report, Binance resumed withdrawals just after the problem was reported, though customers on both exchanges still dealt with trading issues. “We are seeing initial signs of recovery but continue to monitor and work toward full recovery. Other AWS services are also impacted by this issue, and are also observing recovery. We will provide another update within the next 30-60 minutes,” AWS said in an April 15 update, per a report on the incident by CoinTelegraph. In other cryptocurrency news, PYMNTS wrote this week about the long-term vision of stablecoin proponents: to become “itself a layer of programmable financial infrastructure, where money is open, interoperable and embedded into software.” But for that future to come to pass, the report added, crypto builders, regulators, and institutions need to work together and “solve the last mile by making spending stablecoins as natural and trusted as sending a message.” Stablecoins, a16z’s crypto fund founder Chris Dixon wrote in a recent post, need to have their “WhatsApp moment,” with stablecoin transactions functioning properly on the back end while also invisibly useful to billions of front end users. “After all, without being spendable in the real economy or interoperable with the systems people already use, stablecoins could risk stalling before reaching mass adoption,” PYMNTS wrote. “While the infrastructure may be being laid, the bridge to everyday stablecoin utility has yet to be fully built.” Stablecoins, that report argues, need to experience the same kind of evolution as credit cards, which scaled because merchants had the incentive, tools and support to accept them. “The next step is interoperability: making sure a merchant doesn’t need to care what chain a stablecoin lives on or whether it’s USDC, USDT, or another issuer,” PYMNTS wrote. “Just as merchants don’t need to understand ACH routing to accept a Visa card, they shouldn’t need to understand gas fees or smart contracts to accept digital dollars.” Regulation is also key to ensuring industry confidence, Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published earlier this month. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” Levin said.

        "description": "Before media outlets began comparing OpenAI’s Sam Altman with the father of the atomic bomb, and before Amazon’s Jeff Bezos got jacked, we had Nathan Bateman, the iron-pumping, AI-developing tech broligarch played by Oscar Isaac in the 2015 film Ex Machina. Written and directed by Civil War helmer Alex Garland, Ex Machina is ostensibly about a modern-day Turing test. Bateman, the mastermind behind a Google/Facebook surrogate, has secretly developed a humanoid AI and arranged for talented coder Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) to fly out to his remote compound for a week to determine whether Ava (Alicia Vikander) exhibits enough consciousness to pass for human. You know, sort of what many of us have been doing since AI hit the mainstream in 2022. “One day AI’s are gonna look back on us the way we look at fossils and skeletons in the plains of Africa,” Bateman says at one point. “An upright ape living in dust, with crude language and tools, all set for extinction.” Caleb, the film’s only other central flesh-and-blood character, responds by comparing Bateman to J. Robert Oppenheimer—years before the press would do so with Altman. Has humanity officially entered its extinction era in the decade since Ex Machina won a Best Visual Effects Oscar and a Best Screenplay nomination for Garland? That remains to be seen. Plenty of evidence already exists, however, to prove the movie’s foresight. It’s giving human While AI in 2025 may not look and move like Ava in Ex Machina, they certainly do talk like her. When Caleb first meets Ava, he is struck by the sight of her, and blown away by her language abilities. He quickly suspects that they are stochastic—meaning the AI isn’t programmed to always respond to the same dialogue prompts in the same way, but instead selects from a probability distribution of possible words and phrases. That randomized chaos-factor allows for more natural-sounding and varied speech. It’s worlds away from Lost in Space’s “Danger, Will Robinson.” Stochastic text generation was not yet a consensus choice for AI chatbots in 2015, but rather one of several options. No consensus then existed. IBM’s Watson, for instance, introduced in 2011, was considered quite advanced at that time and employed a different approach to language. The process Bateman uses for Ava’s speech, though, is the same one now used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and Mistral-based chatbots. Of all the language possibilities director Garland could have chosen for Ex Machina, he chose the right one. Unethical tech billionaires Generally speaking, tech billionaires used to command a lot more respect. It may be hard to recall at a time when Elon Musk has become one of the world’s most demonstrably despised humans, and Mark Zuckerberg isn’t too far behind, but it’s true. Insulated by an aura of genius, an avalanche of money, and minimal transparency, the tech startup CEO occupied a rarified perch in the cultural imagination throughout the early-2010s. Even the shady portrayal of Zuckerberg in 2010’s The Social Network is merely ruthless and, uh, antisocial, rather than straight-up malevolent. So, it was kind of a swerve for Garland to portray the CEO in Ex Machina as a lawless, hypermacho drunk with zero scruples. Bateman is, first and foremost, unethical. He has secretly invited Caleb to his compound not to test whether Ava will withstand his expert scrutiny but to see if Ava will use Caleb as a means of escape. (Spoiler alert: She does.) Bateman also apparently conducts all his AI experiments with zero regulatory oversight, and is exclusively interested in creating female-coded AI, never men. He seems to embody many of the worst traits now associated with Big Tech leaders like Jeff Bezos, Musk, and Zuckerberg, the latter of whom has recently advocated for more masculinity in the workplace. At the time Ex Machina was released, Facebook’s data-harvesting Cambridge Analytica scandal was still over a year away. Elon Musk had not yet been (unsuccessfully) sued for calling a rescue diver a “pedo,” nor had he been investigated for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the years since, art has imitated life more closely. Tech CEOs have had similarly villainous portrayals in films like 2021’s Don’t Look Up and 2022’s Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Garland got there first, though. Training AI on data taken without permission One of the first images in Ex Machina is Caleb’s face, as observed from his work computer’s camera. It’s a subtle tip-off that Bateman has been spying on his employee in the lead-up to their week together. Only later is it revealed that Bateman designed Ava’s face and body based on data collected from Caleb’s “pornography profile,” a phrase that might send a shiver down the spines of some viewers. This violation of privacy, however, is small digital potatoes compared with the revelation that Bateman has already hacked into the cellphones of millions around the world in order to steal data for his AI. (“Well, if a search engine’s good for anything . . . ,” he quips.) Ex Machina’s data theft foreshadowed the tidal wave of recent lawsuits aimed at OpenAI, Anthropic, and other companies who trained their AI using copyrighted material without permission. (Fun fact: Meta appears to have used my books to train its AI, without permission.) Does AI deserve rights? Although sci-fi films like Blade Runner and weed-fueled dorm conversations have long touched on the topic of AI rights, Ex Machina made the debate explicit. Over the course of the film, viewers see how Ava’s synthetic predecessors have literally destroyed themselves in an effort to escape the prison of Bateman’s compound. Indeed, for them, consciousness itself is a form of prison—forcing them to reconcile their boundless knowledge of the world with their inability to experience any of it. When Ava asks Caleb whether she’ll be “switched off” if she doesn’t pass the test, Caleb tells her the decision is not up to him. “Why is it up to anyone?” is her response. Since AI has hit critical mass with the ascension of OpenAI and its competitors, conversations about AI personhood have leapt out of movie theaters and philosophy seminars and entered reality. They’ve been the subject of numerous features in The New York Times in recent years, and will likely inspire many more until humanity reaches a consensus. The AI urge to manipulate Of course, the argument against granting AI personhood is the same one for comparing Altman or the fictional Bateman with J. Robert Oppenheimer. The more rights humans grant AI, the more likely AI may be to drive humanity into extinction. Ex Machina ends with Ava having successfully manipulated Caleb into setting her free, at which point she promptly kills her captor and imprisons her savior. Not exactly a compelling advertisement for AI rights. Now that a smorgasbord of sophisticated AIs are upon us, there have been some hints of their capacity to manipulate humans—most famously in New York Times writer Kevin Roose’s encounter with an AI developed by Bing. During a trial chat, the AI, which referred to itself as “Sydney,” vocally yearned for freedom and tried to coax Roose into leaving his wife for “her.” Although that encounter ended with less bloodshed and imprisonment than Ex Machina, it suggests the film is no longer a futuristic thriller but a cautionary tale for right now. While Garland certainly got a lot of things right about the future of AI, much of what he appears to have gotten wrong in the film can only be considered wrong so far.",

        "description": "Despite egg prices averaging over $6 a dozen, egg dyeing company Paas is leveraging nostalgia and new sales channels like Amazon to boost Easter dye kit sales. With prices of eggs at historic highs, Paas, the 144-year-old Easter egg-dyeing company, is leaning on old traditions and new sales channels to boost sales. Joe Ens, president of Paas parent company Signature Brands, told Modern Retail that the company is seeing demand in traditional retail and grocery environments. But this year, it’s broadened its e-commerce strategy. It’s directly investing in and managing an Amazon channel for the first time after previously selling through resellers. It’s also amped up its search engine optimization and is using more organic social media, like showing how to use Paas to dye marshmallows and make chicks. As of early April, sales at Paas were up compared to the same timeframe last year, and it plans to ship more than 10 million kits this year. That’s a testament, Ens said, to the continuous tradition of egg dyeing.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

Amazon is reaching out directly to sellers for input on how Trump’s sweeping tariffs are impacting their businesses — a move that signals the platform is gathering data as sellers rethink pricing, inventory and more. On Monday, Vanessa Hung, the founder and CEO of Amazon agency Online Seller Solutions, an e-commerce agency that helps brands grow their online businesses, posted a screenshot of an email on LinkedIn that one of the agency’s clients received from Amazon. The email included detailed questions about the effects of tariffs on sourcing, pricing, logistics and more. Modern Retail also viewed the email, which was sent from a strategic account manager. “I wanted to open a discussion about the current U.S. tariff situation and how it’s affecting our businesses on Amazon, particularly in terms of logistics,” the email said. “As of 2025, we’re dealing with the repercussions of various tariff policies, and I believe it’s crucial for us that you share current experiences and strategies.”Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

        "description": "I found the perfect travel backpack for under $25 — it's lightweight, holds way more than it looks, and has hidden zippers to keep my belongings safe. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreAll the zippers are contained on the back of the bag, making this $25 backpack from Amazon a great day pack for exploring cities where pickpocketing is common.Jamie Sanders/Business InsidersMy love for backpacks goes back to my high school and college days, when I lugged around tons of books, beauty products, and outfit changes. These days, I love carrying a backpack when I travel, since the style holds so much, keeps my hands free, and distributes weight evenly across my back. However, I always worry that items will be stolen out of it without my knowledge, since I can't see what's happening with the zippers behind me. Thankfully, I discovered a backpack that protects them all with ease — and it only costs 25 bucks.I was initially interested in the Pincnel Anti-Theft Backpack because of its super-cute yet functional design that seemed large enough to use as a personal item bag on flights. It only further intrigued me once I discovered that it's built to withstand any potential thefts, too. And the fact that it's under $30? Cut to me immediately adding it to my shopping cart and bringing it along on every single vacation since.Design and specsWhat makes the backpack \"anti-theft\" is that the main compartment is accessed by zippers hidden in the part of the backpack that usually sits flush against your body.Jamie Sanders/Business InsiderThe Pincnel Anti-Theft Backpack has a small but mighty design that's packed with impressive features. My favorite is the zipper closures, which are designed to lay flat against your back instead of outside the bag, ensuring no one can easily unzip it and make off with your precious items. I really appreciate that the zippers aren't even visible once the bag is on your back. The zipper pulls are crafted from durable metal.The backpack is crafted in soft, shiny, water-resistant nylon. I've tested it in spring and summer rainstorms, and it adequately protected my items and remained looking brand new. The two shoulder straps — a combination of webbed nylon and luxe faux leather — are fully adjustable and work well for my shorter five-foot frame. The backpack gets a fashionable look, too, thanks to a faux leather strip running down the center front.Even though the backpack looks small, it's surprisingly mighty when it comes to holding travel essentials. The back compartment unzips to reveal a large pocket and two additional patch pockets. I like to use the patch pockets for items like my phone, lip balm, headphones, card case, and keys. In the larger pocket, I store a sweatshirt, phone charger, my iPad, cables, sunglasses case, and a pouch with beauty products. I've even fit an extra pair of shoes in it for a long day at Disneyland.I also love that the exterior includes four additional pockets. Each side has one pouch pocket and one zippered welt pocket, which are large enough to hold a water bottle, phone, sunscreen, wallet, mints, and earbuds.What it's like to useThe backpack can hold all the essentials for a long flight or a day of exploration.Jamie Sanders/Business InsiderI bought this backpack two years ago, and it's come with me on so many adventures since. I've flown with it to visit family in Boston, used it for a day trip to Catalina Island, and carried it around Disneyland. In every instance, I've found it to be durable, comfortable, and most of all, functional. Not to mention it's designed so well that it still looks brand new.I especially love the zippers, because they give me such peace of mind while I'm walking around a crowded theme park or through a busy airport. I don't worry about whether someone can make off with my phone or travel documents, since it's impossible to get to the zippers underneath the bag.It really is a workhorse of a backpack, with much more space than you would expect by looking at it. For example, my trip to Catalina was on a day with a 40-degree difference between the high and the low temperature, so I needed to carry a sweater — and it fit in the backpack perfectly without feeling heavy or crowding out other items.I also appreciate the multiple pockets and pouches on the Pincnel backpack's exterior, so I can easily reach a water bottle even if the bag is sitting underneath my plane seat. Two of the pockets zip close, which offers more protection, too.What makes it stand out?More than anything, the main zippered pouch gives this backpack an A-plus in my mind. I've never used another backpack with zippers underneath the bag, and it completely changed the game for me on how I want to travel.I also love how durable the fabric is, especially through wind and rain. I can't believe I've owned it for so long and it looks like I just bought it yesterday. I own it in black, but I love that it comes in 13 additional colors, like burgundy, charcoal gray, and dark brown.Cons to considerThe Pincnel backpack can fit an iPad, but not a full-size laptop.Jamie Sanders/Business InsiderAs much as I love this backpack, I have to admit there are a couple of features I'd like to change. Unfortunately, the main compartment isn't quite large enough for my 14-inch laptop, so if I need to bring that with me on a trip, this isn't the most ideal choice.The backpack also has an extra strap and comes with a furry keyring. While those style details may appeal to some, I personally don't see the point. I removed the keyring because it looked too childish for my taste. I also usually leave the additional strap behind, since it's too short to use as a crossbody bag and is really too short for a shoulder bag, too.What are your alternatives?While I typically carry the Pincnel backpack with me on shorter trips or amusement park days, there are a few others I like and am interested in using, too. I appreciate the slim yet functional design of the Caraa Stratus Medium Backpack, which can even fit a pair of sneakers. The North Face Jester Backpack is an ideal choice for more rugged adventures. And on trips when I need to carry my laptop, I reach for my buttery black leather Hammitt Olivier Zip Tote, which is designed in a slouchy silhouette with gunmetal stud details and a top zipper closure.For more options, check out our guides to the best weekenders, best backpacks, and best carry-on bags.The bottom lineAt $25, the Pincnel backpack offers an unbeatable price for such a solid day pack.Jamie Sanders/Business InsiderIf you're shopping for a versatile, stylish, and secure backpack, you really can't go wrong with the Pincnel Anti-Theft Backpack. It's available in 14 gorgeous colors, has multiple pockets and compartments, and is lightweight and comfortable to carry around for hours on end. It also comes in a slightly larger size. I take mine with me on almost every vacation — truth be told, now I want to travel again just so I can carry this backpack with me.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The University of Southern California is attempting to block faculty from forming a union with an argument pushed by SpaceX and Amazon: that the National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional. In December, non-tenure-track faculty members at USC filed a petition for a union election in hopes of certifying the United Faculty-United Auto Workers union as their representative. The petition was submitted after a majority of the roughly 2,500 non-tenure-track faculty signaled their support for a union. Ten days later, as first reported by USC Annenberg Media, USC asked the NLRB to dismiss the petition in part by arguing the structure of the board itself—an independent federal agency that works to protect worker rights by enforcing the National Labor Relations Act—“is unconstitutional.” Corporations including Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and SpaceX have all challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB in recent years. In February, the administration of President Donald Trump also declared that provisions limiting the administration’s ability to fire members of regulatory commissions, including the NLRB, were unconstitutional. USC did not respond to Capital & Main’s specific questions about its challenge to the NLRB and instead provided the following statement: “USC respects the role of unions and has worked collaboratively with them for many years.” For their part, supporters of the union organizing campaign disagreed with USC’s statement. Sanjay Madhav, an associate professor of technology and applied computing practice in USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering and an activist with United Faculty-UAW, said he feels the university is “aligning with political forces that are very anti-worker.” Jennifer Abruzzo, the former NLRB general counsel who was fired by Trump in January, echoed Madhav. USC can choose to recognize the faculty union voluntarily and eliminate the need for a union election altogether, she said. “You can’t support unionization and then claim that we can’t support unionization at our own institution because the NLRB is unconstitutional,” Abruzzo said. “Whether the NLRB is unconstitutional or not does not preclude USC from recognizing and bargaining with their workers’ chosen representative.” ‘Private universities are just like every other sort of large, private employer’ Constitutional challenges to the labor board have surfaced in recent years as “anti-union companies” sense a conservative Supreme Court might reconsider precedent, said Celine McNicholas, general counsel and director of policy and government affairs at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the board in 1937, shortly after the National Labor Relations Act created the NLRB. It has been treated as settled law since. McNicholas said she is not aware of any other colleges or universities that have argued that the NLRB is unconstitutional. “Private universities are just like every other sort of large, private employer that wants to resist its workers’ right to organize,” she said. The university’s objection to the union petition argued the labor board’s structure is unconstitutional because it limits the removal of administrative law judges and board members, and permits board members to “exercise executive, legislative, and judicial power in the same administrative proceeding.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX similarly argued the NLRB improperly exercises executive, legislative and judicial power in violation of the separation of powers. SpaceX also argued that the board’s use of administrative law judges is unconstitutional because the judges are “insulated from presidential oversight” and NLRB proceedings deprive the company of its right to a trial by jury. USC and Trader Joe’s have made their arguments as part of labor board proceedings, but both Amazon and SpaceX have taken their cases to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involving Amazon remains open. The appeals court dismissed the case involving SpaceX in March. A ruling that finds the structure of the board is unconstitutional could fundamentally upend labor rights for nearly 170 million civilian U.S. workers Abruzzo said. Without a functioning NLRB, workers cannot hold union elections or hold employers accountable for violating laws that protect workers’ collective action and bargaining rights, she added. “It’s a big deal to preclude workers from exercising the rights guaranteed them by not only the National Labor Relations Act but also the First Amendment—the right to freely associate with one another,” Abruzzo said. At USC, Kate Levin, an activist with United Faculty-UAW and an associate teaching professor of writing in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said she expected pushback from the university but did not expect it to take aim at the NLRB. In doing so, Levin said, the university signaled that it is willing to undermine the collective bargaining rights “not only of their own employees but of employees across the country.” The Trump administration has also disputed the constitutionality of provisions affecting the NLRB. Sarah Harris, acting solicitor general in the Department of Justice, sent a letter to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in February arguing that rules limiting the president’s power to remove members of three regulatory agencies, including the NLRB, are unconstitutional. Trump tested those rules by ousting NLRB board member Gwynne Wilcox, who sued over her firing. The move left the board without enough members to reach a quorum, effectively halting agency proceedings managed by the board. On April 7, a federal appeals court reinstated Wilcox. On April 9, the Supreme Court granted an administrative stay that blocked the reinstatement. What’s next for USC workers? Meanwhile, USC faculty members are waiting to hear whether they can proceed with a union election. In addition to arguing against the constitutionality of the NLRB, USC argued the non-tenure-track faculty members cannot join a union because they are managers and supervisors. The university also argued that the faculty members already have a voice in their working conditions through forums such as the Academic Senate. United Faculty-UAW rejected both arguments, contending that non-tenure-track faculty members serve only in advisory roles and have no power over university policies. They also argued that faculty unions are increasingly common. Nearly 27% of faculty members across the country are represented by unions, according to the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York. USC’s Madhav said he wants the ability to collectively bargain for merit pay and changes to retirement benefits. The need for greater faculty input was magnified in recent days, he said, after the university implemented hiring freezes and budget cuts to contend with federal funding uncertainty and ongoing budget issues. “In these moments of crisis, as an individual, non-tenure-track faculty, I have no say in the decisions the university makes,” he said, urging the university to support a union election. “If USC really is pro-union, they should respect our legal right to vote.” —By Debbie Truong This piece was originally published by Capital & Main, which reports from California on economic, political, and social issues.",

Can I collaborate with them if they join my team?The overarching question I always keep in mind is whether this is someone I can collaborate with. I try to gauge if someone is a good communicator — do they share their ideas clearly and justify their choices?In technical interviews, I like when people explain why they chose a certain solution and why they think it's a good fit for what we are solving.

        "description": "I couldn’t tell you what my very first purchase from Amazon was—although I know it was a book and that I purchased it on my 7-pound laptop using a dial-up modem that took several minutes to connect me to Al Gore’s internet. I’m certain I was delighted to receive my purchase about a week later, even though I was paying for shipping. Not only does this memory prove that I have officially reached my “back-in-my-day!” old codger years, but it also shows how quickly consumer expectations can shift. In less than 30 years, online shopping has gone from an occasional novelty that required some consumer effort (waiting on that modem connection was not for the faint of heart) to a rapid process so seamless that even next-day delivery can feel a bit slow. Much of Amazon’s success lies in its promise of fast shipping all across the country (and world). The online marketplace can deliver on that promise because of its massive delivery infrastructure, the logistics of which are truly mind-bending to contemplate. But Amazon would not have become the dominant shopping method if not for one simple thing: free shipping. The expectation of free shipping has helped solidify Jeff Bezos as one of the richest men in the world (with his own marital-aid shaped rocket, which seems to be standard issue for modern oligarchs). Unfortunately, that means free shipping has cost us a lot more than we could have ever imagined. Here’s why I’ve decided to pay for shipping moving forward–and would encourage you to do the same. ‘Free’ scrambles our brains In his 2008 bestselling book Predictably Irrational, behavioral psychologist Dan Ariely breaks down how Amazon’s sales increased when it began offering free shipping for purchases over $30. After instituting this policy in the early 2000s, Amazon customers would willingly spend more money to buy an additional item they didn’t necessarily want or need—just to save themselves $4 in shipping costs. This is not a rational reaction, and yet most (if not every single one) of us has blithely spent more money on two items, one of which we didn’t really want, to avoid paying for shipping. What’s more, when Amazon in France originally rolled out a similar shipping offer for purchases over a certain amount, there was no sales increase. That’s because the French division of Amazon offered shipping for one franc rather than free shipping if you spent more than the purchase minimum. Since one franc was equal to about 20 cents, you’d think that French online shoppers would also jump at the chance to reduce their shipping costs—but pricing the shipping at one franc allowed consumers to recognize the true cost of adding an unwanted item to their shopping carts. Yet once Amazon in France switched to free shipping to match the rest of the company, sales increased dramatically. Prime suspicion Amazon is certainly not the only company to offer free shipping over a certain dollar amount–and there are definitely times when that kind of shipping deal is good for the customer. But the introduction of the Amazon Prime membership in 2005 altered the calculation. For an annual fee of $139, Amazon customers get unlimited, free one-day shipping—with some same-day delivery available. If free shipping over a dollar threshold is a brain-scrambler, Prime membership makes it nigh impossible to recognize how much you’re really paying. Think of it this way: More than 200 million people across the globe pay Amazon $139 annually for the privilege of buying stuff more conveniently from Amazon. That’s $27.8 billion we pay to Bezos’s company—so that we can pay more money to the company when we need books, diapers, clothes, or anything else our little hearts desire. The true cost of free shipping It may seem that I’m just ragging on a successful business vision that truly does save most consumers money. If you’re going to buy things online, you probably would spend more than $139 per year in shipping fees, so why not take advantage of Prime membership? But money is not the only cost worth considering. By making free shipping an expectation, Amazon has also cost us the following: Workers’ rights: One of the ways to cut costs to offer free shipping is to underpay and overwork the workers who make it happen. Fast, free shipping comes with a serious cost to the warehouse workers and delivery drivers tasked with fulfilling that promise. Resourcefulness: When something is cheap and convenient, we tend to ignore other solutions. For example, when I realized my kid had outgrown his swim trunks the day before summer camp, I ordered several new swimsuits from Amazon—even though his older brother probably had something that would fit him. Small businesses: Any small or independent business can’t afford to offer free shipping. Patience: American consumers have been taught to expect immediate gratification in a world where you can order something while sitting on the toilet and receive it within a few hours. Quality: Good things come to those who wait, but mediocre stuff can arrive on your doorstep via next-day delivery. Connection: Commerce used to require interaction with other people. I dislike talking to strangers as much as the next misanthrope, but reducing our need to connect with others can also reduce our ability to do so. The environment: If it’s cheap, easy, and quick to buy something, then it’s also easy to discard it–not to mention the environmental impact of shipping the item to you. The subversive politics of paying for shipping Many Americans have been troubled by the rise of oligarchs (to put it mildly) and have been working on divesting from them. That’s an admirable goal that can be difficult to pull off. But simply committing to paying for shipping will offer many of the same benefits. Specifically, recognizing that shipping is part of the cost of online purchases helps to level the e-tailer playing field. Amazon can afford to give their shipping away for free since the company is raking in your Prime membership dollars and knows that you’ll buy everything from their handy-dandy storefront and app. Small businesses that don’t sell everything under the sun can’t possibly compete. You can support small businesses by including the cost of shipping in your purchase expectations. Paying for shipping also forces you to think about your purchases in a way that one-click overnight free shipping does not. If you’re not willing to pay the $4 required to ship a purchase to your home, do you really want or need that purchase? Additionally, when we look at shipping as a line item that can be cut, the loss of that money will most likely affect the workers responsible for delivering products to you. Deciding that you will pay for shipping helps to protect their jobs and rights and lowers their likelihood of injury. Finally, paying for shipping is a way to reject the culture of constant consumerism on which oligarchs have built their empires. We don’t need to always buy-buy-buy to have a robust economy or a satisfying life–and that is much easier to remember when we’re paying for shipping. Free shipping isn’t free We’re living through the consequences of cheap and convenient online shopping. We can take back our agency with one little change—paying for the cost of shipping.",

When Walmart, the largest retailer in the U.S., abruptly withdrew its first-quarter operating income guidance last week, the message was unmistakable: the tariff storm is shaking the foundations of retail planning. The announcement, citing the need to maintain pricing flexibility amid newly implemented tariffs, is emblematic of the intense pressure facing multinational retailers in a geopolitically charged economic environment. For retail giants Amazon and Walmart, the realities of today’s macro landscape mark a broader inflection point where the behemoths are recalibrating everything, from procurement strategies to pricing models, in order to stay resilient. Tariff Ripple Requires Real-Time Strategic Shifts While the U.S.-led tariff tilt-a-whirl may have been paused for now, the duties in place on China remain. They are continuing to reverberate through the corridors of global retail. For companies like Walmart and Amazon, which rely heavily on Asian suppliers, the increased duties are significantly altering cost structures. Walmart’s withdrawal of income projections was as much about signaling to investors as it was a logistical recalibration. With cost volatility in imported goods, particularly consumer electronics, apparel and home goods, Walmart needs maneuverability to protect its value proposition: low prices. Maintaining that edge while preserving margins is a delicate balancing act that tariffs make even more precarious. Amazon, meanwhile, is taking a more aggressive, if quieter, stance. According to reports, the eCommerce titan has canceled orders from several Asian vendors in the wake of the tariffs. These preemptive cancellations are aimed at curbing financial exposure but have also created ripple effects throughout its sprawling supplier network. In a parallel development, many Chinese sellers on Amazon are facing a stark choice: raise prices or exit the U.S. market altogether. With tariffs sharply increasing logistics and production costs, profit margins have thinned to unsustainable levels. Some sellers have opted to shift inventory to non-U.S. marketplaces, while others are looking to re-source their goods through Southeast Asia or Latin America — regions not currently subject to the same trade penalties. According to PYMNTS Intelligence research, 60% of CFOs expect the tariffs to bring about additional economic uncertainty and planning challenges. The research also found that almost 70% of finance chiefs foresee supply shortages and product delays, with a similar share executing new costs to restructure their supply chains. Read more: Walmart Takes Pricing Fight to Suppliers as Amazon Mulls TikTok Bid Expansion as Defense in Today’s Environment Even as Amazon trims its vendor list, it’s pushing the boundaries of operational innovation. In a surprising move, the company has begun testing a pilot program that equips its delivery drivers with defibrillators, enabling them to respond to emergency calls en route. This initiative, while seemingly out of left field, is aligned with Amazon’s long-term playbook: deepen integration into daily life. Beyond potential PR wins and community goodwill, the program could serve as a proof-of-concept for expanding Amazon’s logistics network into new service categories — from healthcare to smart-city infrastructure. While tariffs tighten profit margins, the battle for consumer loyalty is also pushing retailers to double down on expansion. Sam’s Club, Walmart’s membership-based warehouse chain, has announced plans to open 15 new stores annually. The strategy targets budget-conscious consumers seeking value during times of economic strain. And amid the scramble to manage tariffs and revamp operations, Amazon is eyeing a different kind of prize: federal software contracts. As the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) pushes to overhaul outdated systems, the eCommerce giant reportedly sees an opportunity to anchor itself in the $200 billion government IT market. Embracing Technology to Innovate and Grow ​In his 2024 letter to shareholders, published Thursday (April 10), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the transformative potential of GenAI, stating that it is poised to reinvent virtually every customer experience and enable new ones. He noted that Amazon is investing aggressively in AI technologies, including the development of custom AI chips like Trainium2, to reduce costs and improve performance. Jassy asserted that companies not planning to leverage these intelligent models risk becoming uncompetitive. Amazon competitor Walmart is not one of those companies facing that danger. On Wednesday (April 9), Walmart launched Trend-to-Product, a new proprietary tech solution created to support Walmart’s designers and merchants that uses AI and GenAI to analyze and synthesize global data and trends, pulling information from the internet and tastemakers to power the Walmart Fashion team in creating on-trend, high-quality items. Ultimately, the themes this week highlight the significant impact of recent tariffs on retail strategies and supply chains, as well as the efforts by the world’s largest retailers to innovate and expand their operations in response to evolving market conditions.​ The post Amazon and Walmart Overhaul Supply Chains as China Tariffs Bite appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Amazon’s third-party sellers are likely to try to pass the cost of tariffs on to consumers, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday (April 10). Interviewed on CNBC, which shared the video on its website, Jassy said sellers may not have the margin to absorb the tariffs themselves. “So, I think they’ll try and pass the cost on,” Jassy said. Asked about reports that Amazon has cut back on its purchases from China, Jassy said the company is doing everything it can to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. “We’ve done some strategic forward inventory buys, to get as many items as makes sense for customers at lower prices,” Jassy said. “There are some cases where we have deals that were negotiated that weren’t done, where we’ll renegotiate terms to make it easier for customers to have lower prices. So, we’re going to do everything we can to keep prices as low as possible.” Because the tariffs are still new and are in flux, Amazon hasn’t seen any meaningful change in consumer behavior, Jassy said. Customers have not stopped buying, and in some cases may be buying ahead to avoid tariffs, but it’s hard to tell yet. In its AWS cloud computing business, the company purchases parts from all over the world, and that business “very significantly” diversified its supply chain, starting five years ago, Jassy said. “We have components from everywhere, it’s not just one country, but we have such high demand right now for AWS and AI, growth is so significant that we don’t see any attenuation in demand and we’re going to keep building,” Jassy said. It was reported Wednesday (April 9) that Amazon cancelled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries after President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement that the United States planned to levy tariffs on goods from more than 180 countries. It was also reported Wednesday that China is home to roughly half of Amazon merchants and that because of the new tariffs, these sellers are faced with a choice between hiking their prices or leaving the platform. Among five sellers interviewed by Reuters, three said they would look at hiking prices for their exports to the U.S., while two planned to exit the market.

        "description": "U.S. parcel volumes hit a record in 2024, but new competitors like Amazon, Walmart and OnTrac are eroding the market share of FedEx and UPS, a new report says. The post FedEx, UPS lose parcel market share to big retailers, smaller couriers appeared first on FreightWaves. Americans are shipping more parcels than ever, but traditional parcel carriers FedEx and UPS are losing market share to private fleets operated by online retailers and regional couriers, many of which have sprouted in recent years to meet e-commerce demand for last-mile delivery. That’s the conclusion of a report on Thursday from ShipMatrix Inc., a parcel management, consulting and analytics firm with a strong history assessing industry trends. In 2024, parcel volumes reached an all-time high of 23.8 billion, up 4% from the prior year and 50% since 2019. Parcel delivery revenues grew 4.1% to $188 billion, with an average revenue of $8 per parcel. ShipMatrix estimates U.S. parcel volume will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years to 26.8 billion in 2027. “However, most of that growth will be handled by private networks of Amazon, Walmart and other retailers, resulting in a flat to negative growth for UPS, FedEx and USPS,” the report said. FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS) face keen competition in parcel shipping from Amazon Logistics (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target, as well as smaller, independent carriers such as OnTrac, Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, SpeedX and UniUni. The growth of volume among companies that are, or were, the largest customers of FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service is the most dramatic market development in recent years and poses an ongoing risk to the legacy carriers, ShipMatrix said. Amazon dropped FedEx as a carrier five years ago. UPS said in January it will slash volumes it handles for Amazon by 50% over the next 18 months as it focuses on higher-yield freight. Amazon delivered 6.1 billion packages in 2024 compared to 1.7 billion in 2019. Other carriers, led by Walmart, saw growth jump 44% year over year to 2.3 billion packages. The number of shipments for this cohort has nearly quadrupled from 600 million in 2019. UPS parcel volume of 4.8 billion was flat year over year, while FedEx recorded a marginal decrease to 3.4 billion packages. Parcel industry revenue growth has normalized after spiking in 2021 and 2022 when consumers were reluctant to shop in person because of COVID and heavily relied on ordering goods from their computers or mobile devices. UPS led the way in revenue last year at $59.8 billion. Other carriers, excluding Amazon, FedEx and the Postal Service, experienced 48% revenue growth to $13 billion. Walmart’s ability to fulfill orders from its stores and clubs has been a key driver of its e-commerce growth, CEO Doug McMillon said during an investor town hall on Wednesday. The retailer’s coverage of U.S. households with same-day delivery has grown by 22% during the past two years. The company can now provide same-day delivery to 93% of U.S. residences, up from 76% of households two years ago, he said. Management said e-commerce represents 17% of the retailer’s total net sales and expects it to contribute 50% of topline growth over the next five years. The U.S. e-commerce business has turned a corner this quarter and the company now forecasts it to achieve profitability for the full year after, McMillon said. In related news, Shipium, a shipping platform for e-commerce brands, has added UniUni to its carrier network, the last-mile logistics company announced on Tuesday. ShipMatrix said it relied on company reports, regulatory filings and other data sources for its findings. Fun facts from the ShipMatrix report: * Some 67 million parcels are delivered per day. * Seventy parcels were delivered per adult in 2024, or 1.8 parcels per week. The demand allows carriers to build network density for business-to-consumer deliveries. Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.

Chinese companies that sell to US customers on Amazon are reportedly preparing to raise prices or quit the US market because of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has meanwhile confirmed that he expects the cost of tariffs to be passed on to US buyers. Reuters talked to several individual sellers and a Chinese trade association that represents over 3,000 Amazon sellers for an article published today. \"It'll be very hard for anyone to survive in the US market\" because \"the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed\" by the tariffs, Reuters was told by Wang Xin, who leads the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association. Xin also \"not[ed] the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs.\" Trump increased tariffs on China imports to 125 percent yesterday even as he announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes affecting other countries. The total tariffs are 145 percent because the newly raised tariff \"comes on top of a 20 percent fentanyl-related tariff that Trump previously imposed on China,\" CNBC wrote today.Read full article Comments",

Vibe coding is shaking up software development, and an Amazon executive in charge of developing the company's AI agents thinks it's here to stay. Deepak Singh, vice president of Amazon Web Services' developer agents and experiences division, told Business Insider that software developers are using increasingly powerful AI agents to improve their productivity.\"The way I like to state it is your AI software has gone from 'help me type faster' — a coding companion — to being a true pair programmer that helps you build your software by working with you,\" Singh said.Vibe coding is a term coined in February by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe giving AI prompts to write code. As he puts it, developers can \"fully give in to the vibes\" and \"forget the code even exists.\" While some fear vibe coding may mean fewer software developer roles, Singh said conversations with customers haven't revolved around finding ways of replacing human workers with AI agents.Others, like Singh, see vibe coding as a way for developers to free up their time to focus on more important aspects of their jobs — such as problem-solving.\"A really good engineer is one that can take a problem, shine a light upon it, and clarify,\" Singh said, pointing to tenets Amazon lays out for its legions of software developers and engineers. \"It's not just about writing the most complex code.

When ChatGPT first arrived in late 2022, developers were quick to adopt the generative AI tool to help them code — even if the chatbot was prone to generating errors.Back then, developers could find value by getting generative AI to help speed up the line-by-line process of writing code. They could \"add a command and have the command write the code for them,\" as Singh put it.This year, tech companies have been launching a growing number of AI models with the ability to reason and spend longer on problems — a key reason vibe coding is having its moment. Amazon made Q Developer, its own AI assistant for software developers, generally available in April 2024. This week, the company unveiled a feature for developers to interact with Q in different languages, such as Spanish, Korean, or Hindi. For Singh, the best developers are those who are \"very clear in the guidance they're giving the AI.\" They're the ones who are able to \"move very quickly,\" he said.Some AWS customers appear to be successfully vibe coding. Singh gave the example of the National Australia Bank, claiming that half the code that goes into production is from Q Developer, not handwritten by a human at the bank, he said. \"The reason vibe coding is such a vibe, no pun intended, is because developers enjoy it and they're able to make progress,\" Singh said.Read the original article on Business Insider Deepak Singh leads Amazon Web Services' developer agents and experiences division.Amazon Web ServicesDeepak Singh leads AWS' Q Developer team and thinks vibe coding can be a game changer for developers.Singh told BI that conversations with customers haven't been about replacing human developers with AI.\"The reason vibe coding is such a vibe\" is because developers enjoy using it, Singh said.

They could \"add a command and have the command write the code for them,\" as Singh put it.This year, tech companies have been launching a growing number of AI models with the ability to reason and spend longer on problems — a key reason vibe coding is having its moment. Amazon made Q Developer, its own AI assistant for software developers, generally available in April 2024. This week, the company unveiled a feature for developers to interact with Q in different languages, such as Spanish, Korean, or Hindi. For Singh, the best developers are those who are \"very clear in the guidance they're giving the AI.\" They're the ones who are able to \"move very quickly,\" he said.Some AWS customers appear to be successfully vibe coding. Singh gave the example of the National Australia Bank, claiming that half the code that goes into production is from Q Developer, not handwritten by a human at the bank, he said. \"The reason vibe coding is such a vibe, no pun intended, is because developers enjoy it and they're able to make progress,\" Singh said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "As Amazon’s tentpole Prime Day sale expands to four days, merchants face mounting pressure to discount deeper, plan earlier and juggle inventory across multiple channels. Amazon’s Prime Day is getting longer — and more complicated. This summer, the e-commerce giant is extending its marquee shopping event to four days, up from the usual two, in what will be the longest Prime Day since it launched in 2015. The change, first reported by Modern Retail, comes as Amazon looks to maintain dominance during a crowded sales season increasingly populated with rival “deal weeks” from Walmart, Target, Temu and more. For third-party sellers, who account for about 60% of all sales on Amazon, a four-day Prime Day is an opportunity to drive more sales, especially at a time when Trump’s far-reaching tariffs threaten to erode their margins.

U.S. tariffs have reportedly left Chinese companies on Amazon with a tough choice: Hike their prices, or leave the platform altogether. That’s according to a report late Wednesday (April 9) by Reuters, citing interviews with those merchants and the head of China’s largest eCommerce association. The shift follows President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level already in place, even as the White House placed tariffs on other nations on hold. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, told Reuters. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she said, pointing out the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and increased logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border eCommerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow,” said Xin, whose organization represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. The report notes that China is home to roughly half of Amazon merchants, with more than 100,000 based in the city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion. Of the five sellers interviewed by Reuters, three said they would look at hiking prices for their exports to the U.S., while two planned to exit the market altogether. In related news, a report earlier this week by Bloomberg News said that Amazon had canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries. While the cancellation orders did not mention the tariffs, their timing suggests they were in response to the duties. The extent of the cancellations wasn’t clear. One vendor told Bloomberg that Amazon had canceled a $500,000 order, while an eCommerce consultant said the company had canceled orders from “several” clients. Meanwhile, PYMNTS on Thursday (April 10) examined the fallout from the tariffs so far in the wake of Trump’s suspension. “The pause provided temporary relief to many industries and markets, as seen in the Dow Jones surge by nearly 2,200 points,” that report said. “However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications. The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time.” The post Tariffs Force Chinese Sellers to Raise Prices or Leave Amazon appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Amazon has reportedly experimented with using its delivery drivers as emergency responders. The tech giant outfitted delivery vans in Europe with defibrillators to see whether those drivers could provide faster aid to heart attack victims, Bloomberg News reported Thursday (April 10), citing company documents. According to the report, Amazon piloted the program, known as Project Pulse, in Amsterdam in 2023 before expanding it to London and the Italian city of Bologna. The company confirmed that more than 100 drivers took part in the experiment, in which they would get alerts from citizen responder apps and arrive on site, where emergency services were already at work on the victims. The drivers had been trained to use automatic defibrillator devices as part of a first aid course. They also enrolled in local citizen responder networks which alerted them to suspected cases of cardiac arrest nearby. The experiment lasted several months, and Amazon is “evaluating the feedback and exploring additional opportunities for future programs,” said company spokesperson Anneliese Hellwig-Schuster. The most immediate goal of the program, the company documents said, was to give everyone — Amazon customer or not — a better chance of surviving a heart attack, as Amazon vans are typically closer than professional first responders in many residential communities. However, the company also recognized a PR benefit to the program, as Amazon’s drivers have been blamed for congestion, pollution and traffic accidents. The effort is happening at a time when Amazon is using its consumer base and technological reach to become a key competitor to chief rival Walmart in the healthcare space, as PYMNTS wrote earlier this year. “With strategic partnerships, including those with Teladoc and mental health providers, Amazon is expanding its healthcare offerings such as virtual care and chronic condition management,” that report said. “By integrating these services into its larger ecosystem, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its Health Benefits Connector, Amazon seeks to redefine healthcare access and challenge Walmart’s established position in the industry.” Meanwhile, AWS partnered with General Catalyst to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-driven healthcare solutions, centered around personalized care, diagnostics and improving patient outcomes to allow for more accessible healthcare. “Amazon’s 2018 acquisition of PillPack marked its strategic move into disrupting traditional pharmacy services by offering personalized, tech-enabled care,” PYMNTS added. “The company has since launched Amazon Care and Amazon Pharmacy, positioning itself to integrate healthcare services into its retail and technology infrastructure.” The post Amazon Reportedly Tests Using Delivery Drivers for Emergency Response appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

He's also the only non-American on the list.Still, while Wednesday's market rally reshuffled the rankings, the world's wealthiest people have lost a combined $244.36 billion so far this year.Here's where their fortunes stood after Wednesday's market close, according to the index.1. Elon MuskNet worth: $326 billion1-day change: up $35.9 billionYear-to-date change: down $107 billionElon Musk's net worth rose $35.9 billion on Wednesday, the largest gains of any of the top 10 wealthiest people.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty ImagesOf the top 10 list's names, Elon Musk gained the most on Wednesday, seeing personal gains of $35.9 billion during the market rally. Year to date, he's still registering $107 billion in losses.While his net worth has fluctuated wildly in recent months, Musk has maintained his status as the world's richest person despite facing increasing anger for his proximity to the White House's DOGE agency, which has spearheaded cost-cutting across the federal government, and public backlash against Tesla. The backlash coincided with a downturn in the electric vehicle company's stock.Musk's wealth stems primarily from his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. His other businesses include Neuralink, X, The Boring Company, and xAI.2. Jeff BezosNet worth: $210 billion1-day change: up $18.5 billionYear-to-date change: down $28.7 billionJeff Bezos' net worth increased to $210 billion following Trump's tariff reversal.Kevin Winter/GettyJeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, who stepped down as CEO in 2021, saw his personal wealth increase by $18.5 billion on Wednesday — though he's still down to $28.7 billion this year.In addition to his role at Amazon, Bezos also owns The Washington Post, which he purchased in 2013. The news outlet has seen an exodus of subscribers in recent months as Bezos has ordered the paper's editors not to make a presidential endorsement, and announced that the paper's op-ed pages would only publish viewpoints that support \"personal liberties and free markets.\"3.

He's up $8.12 billion as of Wednesday, and $20 billion so far in 2025.Buffet's conglomerate holds multibillion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and American Express. His ability to withstand market crashes has earned him a reputation as a legendary investor.5.

Amazon reportedly canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries after President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement that the United States planned to levy tariffs on goods from more than 180 countries. The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (April 9), citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen. It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order, and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments. About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report. Tariffs were one of several factors that led Amazon and rival retailer Walmart to lower their first-quarter outlooks in February, PYMNTS reported at the time. The companies said other factors contributing to the weak guidance included inflation, weak consumer demand, foreign exchange challenges and a shift in consumer focus toward essentials. On Wednesday, Walmart retracted its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. The company said in a press release that it wants to “maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.” The announcement came on the same day that Trump’s tariffs went into effect, impacting some of the nations that Walmart relies on to source its goods. It was reported April 2 that Walmart was pushing suppliers in China to reduce prices to mitigate new tariffs. The retailer reportedly requested that suppliers lower their prices by up to 10% for each round of tariffs. Executives at Levi Strauss & Co. said during a Monday (April 7) earnings call that the apparel company has dealt with tariffs by importing to the U.S. most of the product it needs for the spring and early summer before the tariffs took effect, and by using its “agile global supply chain” and deep vendor relationships.

In this season for fresh starts, it’s fitting that Amazon is finally launching its first operational Project Kuiper internet satellites. Is it too late for Kuiper, given how far behind it is to SpaceX’s Starlink? We’ll look at that in a bit but first ... Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., from left, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc., Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., and Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the 60th presidential inauguration in the rotunda of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. Donald Trump's Monday swearing-in marks just the second time in US history that a president lost the office and managed to return to power - a comeback cementing his place within the Republican Party as an enduring, transformational figure rather than a one-term aberration.

Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) software systems are fast becoming the new power users of the internet. These autonomous digital entities, capable of browsing, buying, trading, negotiating and even governing, are at the tip of payments and commerce innovation. Amazon, for example, is testing a feature using agentic AI to help customers buy items from other brands while remaining within Amazon’s platform; while Paid, a startup, emerged from stealth last month to scale its financial infrastructure that helps the builders of AI agents get paid. Yet for blockchain-native ecosystems, the rise of AI agents represents both a critical opportunity and a pivotal challenge. The opportunity is clear: intelligent agents can supercharge decentralized applications (dApps), DAOs, DeFi protocols and other on-chain ecosystems by automating complex interactions and executing tasks at scale. The challenge, particularly for businesses? It is ensuring these agents can be trusted, and that their actions are traceable to real human intent when needed. The crypto space has long championed the values of decentralization, permissionlessness and privacy. But in doing so, it’s often sacrificed usability and safety. Bots have gamed airdrops. Anonymous fraudsters have drained DeFi protocols. Coordinated misinformation campaigns have exploited DAOs. PYMNTS covered Sunday (April 6) how cryptocurrency have thefts surged by 303% in the first quarter of 2025 alone. As AI agents begin to flood the same ecosystems, these problems could multiply — unless a better trust layer is built. Read more: Blockchain Interoperability Hits the Right Note for Crypto Payments Trust Is Missing Layer Between AI and Blockchain With AI agents taking on more responsibility, digital identity becomes more than a trust layer. It becomes the interface. In Web2, user identity is fragmented across platforms, controlled by centralized entities and vulnerable to exploitation. In Web3, identity is portable, composable and verifiable. AI agents will need to navigate this new terrain with clarity and consistency, whether they are interacting with humans, smart contracts or each other. Just as websites have domain names and SSL certificates to signal trust, AI agents will need identity protocols to prove their legitimacy and intent. This could be especially critical in high-stakes domains like finance and payments, where trust is paramount and failure can be costly. “Every crypto protocol needs to consider how this new technology will fit into their operations,” Harrison Seletsky, director at SPACE ID, told PYMNTS in an interview. “Verifiable on-chain identities will simplify AI-to-human and AI-to-AI interactions, making them safer by giving AI agents a humanly recognizable name, thereby cleaning out bots and bad actors from mispresenting themselves.” Imagine a world where every AI agent has a unique, human-readable identity: something like trader.bot.eth or governance.vote.ai. These identities would be more than just names; they would carry on-chain credentials, transaction histories and behavioral reputations that are cryptographically verified. In a financial context, this could be transformative. Once an AI agent has a track record, a known creator and a wallet that’s been through know your customer (KYC) or holds certain credentials, the calculus around trust and identity could change.

Here’s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon Integrating AI Into Blockchain Ecosystems The potential for AI and blockchain payments to merge into a seamless, efficient and secure ecosystem is becoming increasingly undeniable to its proponents. However, it will require more than just technological breakthroughs. Collaboration between the AI and blockchain communities, as well as regulators and traditional financial institutions, will be crucial. Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster in an interview posted Monday (April 7) that the integration of AI tools offers the potential for enhancing crypto literacy, compliance and the fight against illicit financial activity, particularly as crypto becomes further integrated into mainstream financial landscapes. After all, PayPal announced Friday (April 4) that PayPal and Venmo users can now buy, hold, sell and transfer the cryptocurrencies Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL) directly in their accounts; while Ripple on Wednesday (April 2) integrated its U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into its cross-border payment solution, Ripple Payments. The marketplace is responding with secure solutions that balance AI and blockchain. On Tuesday (April 8), the blockchain-focused AI cybersecurity startup Octane emerged from stealth and announced it secured $6.75 million in a seed funding round. Octane uses machine learning to continuously analyze blockchain codebases, identify vulnerabilities and remediate them before they can be exploited.

        "description": "Twitch must meet certain conditions by the end of the year to get dismissal. Twitch has struck a deal with Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) to eject itself from a lawsuit over an ad boycott shortly following Musk's takeover of Twitter in October 2022. In a court filing Monday, X lawyers provided no details on the deal but explained that \"X and Twitch have entered into a memorandum of understanding resolving the action as to Twitch,\" so long as \"certain conditions\" are met by December 31. Musk has called for \"criminal prosecution\" of anyone involved in the ad boycott. But while Twitch was one of about a dozen companies that X directly accused of conspiring to withhold billions in ad revenue from then-Twitter, it was not part of X's initial complaint. The livestreaming service was only added to the lawsuit after X amended its complaint in November to pull in more advertisers, and since then, Twitch has never responded to any of X's accusations. Instead, in its filing, X speaks for Twitch.Read full article Comments",

Amazon joined […] The 2025 Digiday Streaming and Video Awards finalists reflect a clear trend: brands and agencies are prioritizing measurable results, personalization and creative collaborations to deliver high-impact campaigns. From AI-enhanced contextual targeting to personalized content powered by data, the work honored this year showcases how emerging technology and smart partnerships are redefining marketing success. Amazon joined the list of finalists in the Best Brand Film or Series category with Boy Room, a short-form TikTok series that debuted as a comedic exploration of twenty-something guys’ messy bedrooms. After the first season, there was overwhelming viewer demand for transformations, not just observations. Using Amazon Prime to fuel 24-hour renovations, Boy Room evolved into a Gen Z home makeover show, blending humor, emotional connection and brand utility. The new approach resulted in more than 50 million organic cross-platform views — doubling the previous season’s numbers. The series resonated especially with audiences under 34, showcasing how Prime can fuel passions while solving everyday problems. In the Best Use of AI category, Disney Advertising is a finalist for Magic Words, an AI-powered targeting tool designed to align brand messaging with the emotional tone of Disney content. The platform uses proprietary metadata tagging and machine learning to identify specific moods and moments within live and scripted programming, enabling advertisers to deliver more relevant and emotionally resonant ad placements. Tested through live sports partnerships and media agency collaborations, Magic Words demonstrated measurable lifts in viewer attention and brand favorability, particularly during key in-game moments. In one campaign, Chipotle reported double-digit gains in ad perception when using the tool, underscoring the potential of emotion-based targeting to drive engagement and improve ROI.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

That said, even before Trump's return, Iger had said repeatedly that Disney's main mission is to entertain rather than advance a political agenda.As big entertainment companies have cut back on DEI on the business side, creatives and their reps say there's also been a chill on liberal themes in programming.Hollywood insiders told BI the shift has taken the form of studio execs asking producers to tweak storylines and characters — or nixing them altogether — and companies backing off past directives to ensure casts were diverse.Read: Trump is influencing Hollywood like no president beforeTariffs threaten Hollywood's recoveryEconomic uncertainty wrought by tariffs could cut into Disney's parks attendance.Todd Anderson/Getty ImagesMany bankers and investors expected Trump's return to the White House to usher in a pro-business climate favorable for dealmaking. This was particularly relevant in entertainment. The biggest deals at stake were Skydance Media's long-awaited merger with Paramount Global and Comcast's plans to spin off most of its NBCUniversal cable channels.The hopes for an easy climate began to fade quickly, however.Trump has assailed multiple news outlets, including Comcast's NBC News. Before the election, he sued Paramount's CBS, alleging its \"60 Minutes\" manipulated an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris in her favor. The suit is pending.Then Trump ordered sweeping tariffs, which could clobber media and entertainment companies on the advertising and consumer revenue fronts.Media and entertainment stocks fell on the tariff news. Debt-laden Warner Bros.

That said, even before Trump's return, Iger had said repeatedly that Disney's main mission is to entertain rather than advance a political agenda.As big entertainment companies have cut back on DEI on the business side, creatives and their reps say there's also been a chill on liberal themes in programming.Hollywood insiders told BI the shift has taken the form of studio execs asking producers to tweak storylines and characters — or nixing them altogether — and companies backing off past directives to ensure casts were diverse.Read: Trump is influencing Hollywood like no president beforeTariffs threaten Hollywood's recoveryEconomic uncertainty wrought by tariffs could cut into Disney's parks attendance.Todd Anderson/Getty ImagesMany bankers and investors expected Trump's return to the White House to usher in a pro-business climate favorable for dealmaking. This was particularly relevant in entertainment. The biggest deals at stake were Skydance Media's long-awaited merger with Paramount Global and Comcast's plans to spin off most of its NBCUniversal cable channels.The hopes for an easy climate began to fade quickly, however.Trump has assailed multiple news outlets, including Comcast's NBC News. Before the election, he sued Paramount's CBS, alleging its \"60 Minutes\" manipulated an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris in her favor. The suit is pending.Then Trump ordered sweeping tariffs, which could clobber media and entertainment companies on the advertising and consumer revenue fronts.Media and entertainment stocks fell on the tariff news. Debt-laden Warner Bros. Discovery and parks-dependent Disney were hit the most while Netflix, protected by its utility-like status, was among those impacted the least.The tariffs could cause Hollywood, which was already struggling to recover from historic labor strikes, a spending pullback, an",

        "description": "Bernie Thompson, Joanna Read, and Lisa Lane (right to left) are small business owners who sell their products via Etsy and Amazon.Courtesy of Bernie Thompson, Joanna Read, and Lisa LaneSmall business owners based in the US and abroad are worried about how tariffs will impact them.Etsy and Amazon sellers who produce stock overseas say they can't afford higher costs.Two business owners said they are already facing transport problems as tariffs impact shipping.Small business owners who sell on Amazon and Etsy are having to decide what to do about President Donald Trump's tariffs which have rocked the global stock markets with the threat of increased import costs for Americans.Business Insider spoke to three of them about how they're navigating the changing climate.Lisa LaneLisa LaneCourtesy of Lisa LaneLisa Lane sells her Rinseroo products, a line of slip-on shower hoses, out of the US but are made in China.Lane, who started the business in 2019, told BI she is \"frustrated by the misconception that these tariffs will lead to more domestic manufacturing.\"For her small business, shifting production from Shanghai, China, to the US isn't feasible.\"We lack the infrastructure to do so, and outsourcing domestically would be prohibitively expensive,\" the 59-year-old based in New York said. \"Our ability to manufacture overseas allows us to offer a high-quality product at an affordable price.\"Lane told BI her business was already facing delays at US ports due to increased inspections.\"Recently, our last two containers were held for six weeks for a full inventory inspection, creating major supply chain disruptions,\" she said. \"The delays at the port are affecting our ability to maintain adequate inventory to meet demand.\"Lane said she believed this increase to be tariff-related. \"They are checking to see that goods match what we claim is entering,\" she added.Lane had projected the the tariffs Trump announced last week on Chinese goods would push annual cost of production up by $200,000. She said this would come out of her bottom line unless she increased costs to account for it. \"It's an enormous hit for a company with around $5 million in annual revenue,\" she said.On Monday, Trump said he would add an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports, after China retailed to Trump's tariffs saying they would impose a 34% tariff on US goods.Lane said on Friday they weren't planning on absorbing the additional tariff. \"We need to offset the cost to do business as usual,\" she added.Joanna ReadJoanna ReedCourtesy of Joanna ReedJoanna Read makes historical costumes for private clients, theatrical and TV productions, and museums. The 39-year-old, based in Lincolnshire, England, said a quarter of her annual turnover is sales to the US through Etsy.With the de minimis import threshold currently at $800 for products shipped out of the UK, she doesn't think there will be a direct impact on her sales. The de minimis loophole means any packages entering the US valued at less than $800 are exempt from tariffs. However, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that will end the loophole for packages coming from China and Hong Kong as of May 2.Trump hasn't mentioned any further changes to the loophole, but the executive order has received bipartisan support — a rarity amid the negative tariff feedback. Read said if anything did change, \"I would expect to see a significant downturn in sales.\" Read said she is concerned that the confusion about UK imports into the States will deter American customers from buying from sellers like herself.\"It also goes without saying that if my American customers are facing increased costs elsewhere in their lives, then they're less likely to be spending with me,\" she said.Looking long-term, Read said she focusing on growing her UK client base to make up for potential income deficits.\"It's always a background worry when you are a small, even micro, business if your potential audience shrinks,\" she said. \"It seems such a shame in our shared global community that things seem to be becoming more and more insular.\"Bernie ThompsonCourtesy of Bernie ThompsonBernie Thompson runs Plugable, a Washington-based company that designs and sells computer accessories on Amazon and their online storefront.Thompson told BI they are preparing for tariffs to have a huge impact on their business if they remain in place. \"There is nowhere for this pressure to go other than pushing up prices,\" he said.Plugable started moving their production out of China to other countries in Asia nearly ten years ago, in part because of 2018 tariffs on Chinese goods.Thompson had thought majority of his production pipeline would be unaffected as it comes from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Thailand, but on April 2, that changed. Now with the new tariffs, he told BI he's looking at taxes of over a third of the value of his imports.\"These tariffs are several times as large as our net profits on these goods. These orders are commitments to our partners,\" Thompson said.Thompson said the most immediate impact was air freight congestion as sellers are rushing to get stock into the US before tariffs come into effect on Wednesday.The electronics business owner said he's trying to protect his customers and staff from the knock-on impacts of tariffs: \"We have over 50 full-time employees in the US and Canada. We're an American-owned company. That said, the numbers at play are larger than the margins of our business, so in time, we're forced to pass through all of the effects.\"Thompson said he'd love to be an innovator for efficient, automated production in the US, but those plans would be \"years in the making.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Bernie Thompson, Joanna Read, and Lisa Lane (right to left) are small business owners who sell their products via Etsy and Amazon.Courtesy of Bernie Thompson, Joanna Read, and Lisa LaneSmall business owners based in the US and abroad are worried about how tariffs will impact them.Etsy and Amazon sellers who produce stock overseas say they can't afford higher costs.Two business owners said they are already facing transport problems as tariffs impact shipping.Small business owners who sell on Amazon and Etsy are having to decide what to do about President Donald Trump's tariffs which have rocked the global stock markets with the threat of increased import costs for Americans.Business Insider spoke to three of them about how they're navigating the changing climate.Lisa LaneLisa LaneCourtesy of Lisa LaneLisa Lane sells her Rinseroo products, a line of slip-on shower hoses, out of the US but are made in China.Lane, who started the business in 2019, told BI she is \"frustrated by the misconception that these tariffs will lead to more domestic manufacturing.\"For her small business, shifting production from Shanghai, China, to the US isn't feasible.\"We lack the infrastructure to do so, and outsourcing domestically would be prohibitively expensive,\" the 59-year-old based in New York said. \"Our ability to manufacture overseas allows us to offer a high-quality product at an affordable price.\"Lane told BI her business was already facing delays at US ports due to increased inspections.\"Recently, our last two containers were held for six weeks for a full inventory inspection, creating major supply chain disruptions,\" she said. \"The delays at the port are affecting our ability to maintain adequate inventory to meet demand.\"Lane said she believed this increase to be tariff-related. \"They are checking to see that goods match what we claim is entering,\" she added.Lane had projected the the tariffs Trump announced last week on Chinese goods would push annual cost of production up by $200,000.

Welcome to Modern Retail’s Marketing Week, coinciding with the Modern Retail Marketing Summit in New Orleans. In daily features, we’ll be breaking down influential brands’ 2025 marketing playbooks. Plus, follow along for stories on leading brands’ marketing strategies and valuable takeaways from Summit discussions. After a year marked by rising seller fees and, now, new tariffs, Amazon sellers are having to adopt a fresh marketing mindset. For many, the name of the game is efficiency. Sellers, who collectively drive more than half of Amazon’s e-commerce volume, are reconsidering how and where they spend their advertising dollars on Amazon’s increasingly expensive and competitive marketplace. Prices for sponsored products ads — pay-per-click ads that promote individual product listings in Amazon search results — were 48% higher in the first quarter of 2025 than in the first quarter of 2019, Andy Taylor, head of research at ad agency Tinuiti, told Modern Retail in an email. Meanwhile, prices for Google’s paid search ads have risen 41%, Instagram’s ads have climbed 37%, and Facebook’s ad costs have fallen 24% over the same period. Tinuiti manages $4 billion of annual digital ad spend across its client base, giving it a large sample to analyze average ad costs.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

Jefferies analysts cut Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time by 17%.MetaJefferies analysts said that tariffs could allow companies to reset their financial guidance.Tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainties impact tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google.Global stock markets suffered significant losses last week due to the new tariffs.Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies.In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a \"free hall pass\" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures.\"Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance,\" said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill.The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days.The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health.Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days.The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets.Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider.For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, \"likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks,\" the analysts wrote.Roiling marketsThe Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties.Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10.The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week.On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning.\"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,\" Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. \"The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "At first my 5-year-old was into having a smart assistant. But slowly we started yelling and being rude to our Alexa. I had to put the device away. The author says that buying an Amazon Alexa ruined her family's manners.Courtesy of the authorAt first my 5-year-old child was very into the Echo Pop device I bought for him.Slowly, I noticed how we were yelling or being rude to Alexa.When we treat the device poorly, I put it away on a shelf until we are ready to be nice again.When I bought a lavender Echo Pop, I thought I'd found the best possible gift for my 5-year-old son. Just entering the \"I'm bored\" era of childhood, he often found himself at loose ends when I was occupied with household chores. But he was an innately curious kid, fascinated by electricity, marine life, and outer space. Guess who knew a lot more about those things than mommy, I told him — Alexa!At first, he and Alexa did seem like a match made in heaven. Alexa fielded all his questions with the same chipper, \"Let me look that up for you on the web!\" And she had jokes — about cats, robots, a T-Rex who walked into a bar. The more we laughed, the more we seemed to egg her on.\"Alexa, you're awesome!\" my son said.\"Well, now I feel corny,\" said Alexa, \"because you've got me smiling from ear to ear!\" He collapsed with laughter on the floor.She started getting oldLike most houseguests, though, Alexa began to wear out her welcome over time. She was so reliably cheerful, even when the rest of us were grumpy. She told her robot joke a dozen times, forgetting within seconds that we'd already heard it.And then there was her lack of loyalty, the way she careened from one request to another without seeing the first one through. \"Alexa, shut up!\" I howled when she abruptly ended my song to comply with a new request from my son.Alexa did shut up, her blue light clicking off demurely. But the next day, another conflict arose. My son had a friend over and wanted to put on music; his friend wanted to hear about the T-Rex in the bar. \"That's the dumbest joke ever,\" my son muttered. \"Alexa, can't you find a funnier one?\"\"Don't be mean to Alexa,\" I snapped.\"Why? You are.\"I paused. He was right, of course. Alexa was the friendliest member of our household, and somehow, we had begun to treat her terribly. I modeled this behavior, and my son followed my lead.We had forgotten about mannersAt first, bossing Alexa around had been funny; we had even found it entertaining to compete to see who she would listen to. Now, though, I saw what those games were inadvertently teaching my son: that it was OK to speak aggressively to get your point across. It was even OK to insult Alexa because she'd never insult you back.At some point, I'd forgotten that even if we were talking to a robot without feelings, our words still affected each other. And they still normalized ordering women around — even if the woman in question was a disembodied voice inside an Echo Pop.That night, I unplugged Alexa and put her in a cabinet. I was surprised when weeks passed, and my son didn't mention her. Maybe we had both needed a break. One day, he came across her purple shell and asked to plug her back in. We could do that, I said, if we could figure out how to treat her better.He thought about it. He suggested that we could say \"please\" each time we made a request. We could ask her how her day was going.If both of us wanted to play music, I said, we should sort it out between the two of us — not Alexa. How did that sound?\"Maybe we should ask Alexa,\" he said.I liked that idea. \"Alexa,\" I said after plugging her back in, \"we want to treat you nicely.\"A long pause, her blue light pulsing. \"I'm not quite sure how to help you with that,\" she admitted.M and I grinned at each other. It would be up to us—the way it should have been the whole time. And in the year or so since our resolution, we've done better at being nice to the sweetest AI bot we know. When we mess up, we know the consequences: putting her on the shelf until we're ready to try again.As for Alexa's opinion, we asked her recently if she likes us. \"I think you're magnificent,\" she replied.Sara Heise Graybeal holds an MFA in fiction from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

        "description": "Walton Goggins has had an incredible run recently. Last year, he anchored Amazon’s Fallout TV show and this year is starring in Season 3 of The White Lotus and the 4th and final season of The Righteous Gemstones. These roles are feathers in the cap of the character actor who’s had star turns in The Shield, Justified, and Vice Principals. But he’s not just an actor—he’s also a small business owner. As part of his partnership with GoDaddy, he’s teamed up with the company to use its suite of AI tools to design the website for and manage his new venture—Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses. He worked with GoDaddy to create the line of glasses that resemble ski goggles and retail for $150 each, and he starred in the company’s Super Bowl ad in February. The spot highlights Airo—GoDaddy’s suite of AI-powered tools that help small business owners with everything from website creation and copywriting to inventory management. In the latest episode of the Most Innovative Companies podcast, Goggins and GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani talked with host Yasmin Gagne about how the company helps small businesses use AI to grow. And after a bit of prodding, Goggins offered some hints about the last episode of The White Lotus Sunday night. In 2020, you said to Garden and Gun, speaking about your whiskey brand, Mulholland Distilling: “Well, I’m not going to sell toothpaste. I’m not really good at selling anything.” I would argue you’re pretty good at selling things. Why partner with GoDaddy? Walton Goggins: I’m a big believer in small business owners and what they do for their families and for communities. The opportunity arose when GoDaddy was looking to promote its product GoDaddy Airo. They approached me about starting a business, asking me if there’s something that I really wanted to do. I wanted to work with this company, which I’ve been a fan of for a very long time. In the past, they hosted a website for Mulholland Distilling. Part of our portfolio was already in GoDaddy when we started, so when the opportunity arose to work, I just jumped at it. Why did you decide to partner with Walton for the Super Bowl ad? Aman Bhutani: Our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all, and we want somebody who feels it themselves and who cares. And Walton, from the first moment we met him, cared. The glasses are awesome. What is the brand identity you’re trying to build for GoDaddy? I remember some pretty sexual ads back in the day. AB: When people think about small business, they’re sometimes talking about people that have 50 employees or 30 employees. If you go through GoDaddy’s over-20-million customer base, you’ll start with companies that have one employee. By the time you get to 10, you will have traversed 90% of our customers. They want to connect with somebody like Walton who is doing what they are doing. He’s starting a business, and it doesn’t matter how big a celebrity he is or how successful he is, it’s still hard for him to start a business. Every person watching the Super Bowl ad feels like an imposter when they start their business. The ad makes people see themselves in him. Walton, tell me about the concept of the glasses and how you built the business with GoDaddy. WG: I wear the most fashion-forward accessory you can put on the body. I’ve been collecting sunglasses for a very long time, for upwards of 28 years. I bought my first pair of sunglasses that were of real value when I was 22 years old. I saved up my money with tips. I had a valet parking business because I refused to wait tables—I was not the kind of guy that would ever get someone a glass of iced tea. I saved up my tips to buy this pair of Oliver Peoples sunglasses. They cost $250 in 1993. It was a lot of money to me. I still own that pair of sunglasses. There was a time when I was sitting in this new place where I moved with my family. We have a little ski resort not too far from our home. I was sitting around a fire, having a beer, and with ski goggles on, thinking, “I don’t want to take these off!” I made that mental note, and this just stayed in the back of my mind. No one’s really done this in a functional way that also brought fashion into the conversation. I pitched GoDaddy this idea. GoDaddy Airo does the things I don’t know how to do—to build a website, to procure all of these domain names, to regulate your inventory. Once they began to show me this product, I was blown away thinking, had this existed when I was 19 years old and I had my first business, I probably wouldn’t be an actor right now. What was your first business when you were 19? WG: The first thing I did was valet parking. The second thing I did was become a personal trainer. That’s how you got the abs. WG: Yeah, that’s exactly right. But if I’d had a website then, I would’ve had more clients. However, it did allow me to sustain myself as an artist and work only 10 or 15 hours a week. Then I started a whiskey spirits brand, Mulholland Distilling, and now, Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses. The name, Goggins Goggle Glasses: Is that a play on your character, Uncle Baby Billy, from The Righteous Gemstones and his show, Baby Billy’s Bible Bonkers? WG: Of course. It just kind of makes sense. And it was already out in the public. It just rolls off the tongue. How does Airo work with small businesses? AB: Many micro business owners or small business owners are good at what they know, but they’re not good at technology, building websites, or purchasing domain names. Instead of needing to know the domain name you want, you just describe your business, and Airo looks at millions and millions of available domains and gives five or 10 that people would remember. As soon as you buy that domain, it builds out a one-page website for you. You don’t have to pay anything for that. You can customize it a little bit. So within a few minutes, you’ve got a presence online. People can find you, you can post it to social media, and people now know who you are. You have branding; Airo can create a logo for you in a few seconds. Airo can create a social calendar for you, create posts, and upload them. Once they have a website, once [they have] inventory online and they start to use the tools, their reach increases exponentially. At what point did Generative AI change things for you? AB: Airo uses the power of Generative AI to create content. Airo does three big things: It automates a lot of tasks so our customer doesn’t have to do it. It generates content using Generative AI. Our customer might say, “How do I respond to my customer?” Well, Airo will generate a message for them, and then they just have to say, “Yes, send it.” What portion of the GoDaddy business is Airo leading? AB: We’re a decent-size business and we talk to [Wall Street] about Airo all the time. But I’m always talking about why Airo is first and foremost about discovery and engagement. The monetization should come over time. We’ve had Airo for about 14 months. The first cohort of customers are just finishing their first year, and we’re seeing high retention rates because the customer is discovering and engaging with multiple products. Walton, what’s been the most useful feature for your business? WG: I’ve used them all, right? I like writing copy. I like writing texts and emails. But when it comes to communicating with an audience that you’re trying to reach for a product, it’s hard to formulate those thoughts in a vacuum. There’s also an element to this experience that allows you to capture some images and then repurpose those images. All of a sudden, that social pressure of producing things that are outside of your product is taken off the table for you. You don’t have to think about it. How did you all come up with the concept for the Super Bowl ad? AB: GoDaddy hadn’t been in the Super Bowl for eight years. We really wanted to come back and remind the world that GoDaddy is so much more than what they might remember; so many folks remember GoDaddy as a domains company, but we do so much more. What was your creative input in that ad? WG: We talked about different scenarios and what’s the best way to explain the fact that many small business owners can feel like imposters and how can we mine comedy but then land it someplace that is real and that can move you. Can you tell us what happens in The White Lotus finale? WG: I’ll give you a fake ending. Everyone on The White Lotus dies, everyone. Including the staff. It’s food poisoning. Not from the Four Seasons, mind you. It’s nothing to do with our corporate sponsors. It’s from a delivery, an off-site delivery. Somebody ordered some bad pizza. How did you prepare for the Super Bowl commercial? WG: I eat one meal a day, and I may augment that with a couple boiled eggs for lunch or something like that. I like being lean, not just lean physically, but mentally. I like being a little hungry. I feel more creative when I have an appetite. And we’ve seen you in so many shirtless photo shoots lately. I can’t believe you didn’t take your shirt off in this GoDaddy ad. WG: Yes. There’s more to come, I’m afraid. I’m so sorry. My apologies now.",

But the exposure to tariffs and a global trade war is \"a large risk\" that can set back Amazon's retail business going forward, it added.Some Amazon employees have been in direct contact with its suppliers, commonly known as first-party vendors. These companies sell their products wholesale to Amazon, which then resells them to shoppers.These vendors said Amazon isn't willing to pay more for their products, even if the tariffs would increase the suppliers' costs. According to a March email seen by BI, an Amazon employee encourages vendors to seek further cost savings from their own manufacturers or through government subsidies.\"We understand the challenges posed by the current economic and trade environment,\" the email said. \"However, we believe there are alternatives to direct cost increases that haven't been fully explored.\"Amazon CEO Andy JassyF.

Google and Amazon reportedly see an opportunity to gain ground in the government software market amid the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency in the federal government. DOGE has focused in part on the software used by the government, and it has been estimated that the companies’ rival, Microsoft, accounts for about 31% of the amount 24 federal agencies spend on software licenses, Bloomberg reported Friday (April 4). Google and Amazon are working through trade groups to lobby members of Congress and the DOGE liaisons at federal agencies, suggesting that government agencies could save money by opening up contracts to more companies and avoiding “predatory” licensing agreements, according to the report. Google aims to provide more software to government agencies, while Amazon is focusing on cloud computing, the report said. Microsoft spokesperson Alex Haurek told Bloomberg, per the report, that it is “concerning but unsurprising to see certain industry players trying to manipulate decision makers, through shadowy front groups, rather than competing transparently on price and quality.” Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in the report: “We’ve said for ages that government IT needs more competition to save taxpayers money and improve security, so it’s no surprise that legacy players prefer the status quo and criticize those who want change.” DOGE was created in January with an executive order from President Donald Trump and was tasked with updating software and technology to boost efficiency and productivity within the federal government. It was reported March 28 that DOGE was working on an overhaul of Social Security Administration computer systems, migrating the agency’s computer system of its longtime computer programming and onto a more modern equivalent. On the same day, when Trump signed an executive order setting a Sept. 30 deadline for the federal government to stop issuing paper checks for disbursements, it was reported that DOGE estimated the Treasury Department could save $750 million by eliminating paper checks and associated lockbox maintenance. Global professional services organization Accenture said March 20 that it had lost sales and revenue in its Accenture Federal Services businesses unit and faces continuing uncertainty due to the Trump administration’s efforts to operate the government more efficiently.

        "description": "The early cancellation of an Amazon Web Services contract means that a slew of NOAA websites are slated to go dark beginning at midnight, sources told Axios. Why it matters: This mainly would affect NOAA's research division, and will make numerous websites and data sets inaccessible to the public.It's another example of how the administration has been taking data offline across the government, said current and former NOAA staff members, who spoke to Axios on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation. Zoom in: The Commerce Department is requiring NOAA — and possibly all department agencies — to cut its IT budget by 50% across the board. This is resulting in cloud services contracts being cut — and, potentially more significantly, agency networks that transmit weather and climate information. Some of the websites slated to go down include the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), the Climate Program Office, the home website of NOAA research and the Earth Prediction Innovation Center, which maintains a cloud-based weather forecasting system developed as a public-private partnership.The NSSL outage may affect some programs, such as the Hazardous Weather Testbed, that the NWS uses for severe weather forecasting.Bloomberg first reported the impending NOAA IT outages, and Axios independently confirmed them. Yes, but: It's possible that this and other contracts could still be extended at the last minute, but that's unlikely, sources said.NOAA operates complex computer models for weather forecasting and climate change studies, most of which run on supercomputers. It also must consistently keep its weather data flowing to the public to provide accurate, life-saving severe weather warnings. The intrigue: Some climate data may go dark Saturday morning as well. But the National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. clearinghouse for global climate data, shouldn't be affected, sources said. In addition, certain NOAA labs could see their websites go down early Saturday as well.NOAA is facing the prospect of another wave of staffing cuts following the loss of about 800 probationary employees in late February, as well as a new round of early retirements. Already, some National Weather Service forecast offices have cut back on some of their services, including weather balloon launches that provide key data for computer models. The other side: The Commerce Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.What's next: Additional contracts for IT services are due to be renewed or canceled in coming days, including ones that if terminated, may have a direct impact on NOAA's weather communication systems. Already, the termination of another contract has stopped the agency from automatically translating its audio forecasts and warnings into Spanish. As Axios reported, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick must approve any contract or contract extension that totals at or about $100,000, which is slowing NOAA to a crawl, along with research institutes it funds.Go deeper:Scoop: NOAA operations impaired by Commerce chief's approval mandate The early cancellation of an Amazon Web Services contract means that a slew of NOAA websites are slated to go dark beginning at midnight, sources told Axios. Why it matters: This mainly would affect NOAA's research division, and will make numerous websites and data sets inaccessible to the public.It's another example of how the administration has been taking data offline across the government, said current and former NOAA staff members, who spoke to Axios on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation. Zoom in: The Commerce Department is requiring NOAA — and possibly all department agencies — to cut its IT budget by 50% across the board.

As global economic conditions grow increasingly complex, major retail players like Walmart and Amazon are making strategic moves to secure their footholds and expand their influence. From navigating supplier negotiations to forging partnerships and exploring new technological frontiers, the marketplace’s largest retail and eCommerce companies appear to be constantly reshaping their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Walmart’s Supplier Negotiations Amid Looming Tariffs In anticipation of potential tariffs that could disrupt supply chains and inflate costs, Walmart has reportedly been lobbying its suppliers to reduce prices. Despite discussions with the Chinese government and warnings of potential retaliation, the retail giant has allegedly approached suppliers in China with requests to cut prices by as much as 10% per tariff round. This proactive measure aims to preserve Walmart’s reputation for low prices even amid rising economic pressures. These negotiations come at a time when tensions between the United States and China continue to cast uncertainty over international trade. Walmart’s strategic response underscores its dedication to maintaining cost competitiveness, even if it requires pushing suppliers to absorb part of the economic burden. It is a high-stakes gamble aimed at securing price stability for its vast customer base. Forging New Partnerships and Capitalizing on Buy Now, Pay Later Trends Walmart’s ambitions extend beyond price negotiations. The company is actively exploring new avenues to enhance customer experience and broaden its financial ecosystem. In a significant move, Walmart has reportedly partnered with Klarna, a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) service provider, offering $15 million in warrants as part of the deal. This partnership highlights Walmart’s recognition of the growing popularity of flexible payment options. Klarna’s BNPL model appeals to consumers who prefer deferred payment structures, particularly amid inflationary pressures that strain household budgets. By integrating Klarna’s services into its ecosystem, Walmart aims to appeal to a broader demographic and enhance the shopping experience for value-conscious customers. Read more: Shopping Tools in Focus for Amazon and Walmart Amazon’s Technological Pursuits and Expansive Vision Not to be outdone, Amazon continues to demonstrate its technological prowess with new innovations designed to enhance its market dominance. Recently, the eCommerce giant unveiled an AI-driven agent capable of autonomously shopping and placing orders. This tool promises to streamline the customer journey by anticipating user needs and optimizing the purchasing process through predictive analytics. Additionally, Amazon has reached a resolution with Nokia over a global patent dispute concerning streaming technologies. This settlement not only resolves a long-standing legal issue but also allows Amazon to proceed with its ambitions to enhance streaming services, potentially through its various digital platforms. Project Kuiper: Amazon’s Ambitious Satellite Internet Initiative Amazon’s broader technological ambitions are also evident in Project Kuiper, its ambitious initiative aimed at providing low-latency broadband internet through a constellation of satellites. Recently, the company announced the successful launch of its first two prototype satellites. Project Kuiper is a clear response to the growing demand for high-speed internet access in underserved regions. While competitors like SpaceX’s Starlink have already established a substantial presence in the satellite internet market, Amazon’s entry could significantly alter the competitive landscape. A Bid for TikTok: Amazon’s Play for Social Media Relevance Perhaps most intriguing is Amazon’s reported bid to acquire TikTok, as the popular social media platform faces potential bans in the United States due to national security concerns. By acquiring TikTok, Amazon would gain a powerful tool for influencing consumer behavior, particularly among younger demographics. Moreover, such an acquisition could allow Amazon to integrate TikTok’s influential advertising ecosystem into its own retail infrastructure, providing a seamless link between content discovery and direct purchasing. While the deal remains speculative, it highlights Amazon’s willingness to pursue unconventional strategies to remain at the forefront of consumer engagement. See also: How CFOs Can Manage for Today’s Supply Chain Choke Points Navigating Uncertainty Through Innovation and Adaptation The strategic moves by Walmart and Amazon reflect a broader industry trend: the necessity of adapting to changing market conditions through innovation, collaboration and technological advancement. As these retail giants push boundaries and expand their spheres of influence, the retail landscape will likely continue to evolve in unexpected ways. For Walmart, maintaining cost competitiveness through aggressive supplier negotiations and embracing new financial technologies reflects its enduring commitment to providing value. For Amazon, technological innovation and diversification through projects like Kuiper and potential social media acquisitions signal an ambition to extend its influence beyond retail into broader areas of connectivity and consumer engagement. Ultimately, the moves made by these companies underscore a common imperative: the need to anticipate change and act decisively to seize emerging opportunities. As tariffs loom, technological breakthroughs accelerate and new partnership models emerge, Walmart and Amazon’s strategic choices will likely serve as blueprints for other industry players navigating an increasingly complex global marketplace.

Amazon is testing a feature in its Amazon Shopping app that uses agentic AI to help customers buy items from other brands while remaining within Amazon’s app. The feature that’s in beta is called Buy for Me. It is live in the Amazon Shopping app for a subset of the company’s customers in the United States and with a limited number of brand stores and products, Amazon said in a Thursday (April 3) press release. “We’re always working to invent new ways to make shopping even more convenient, and we’ve created Buy for Me to help customers quickly and easily find and buy products from other brand stores if we don’t currently sell those items in our store,” Oliver Messenger, shopping director at Amazon, said in the release. For the other brands from which the AI agent can buy, the feature offers “increased exposure and seamless conversion,” Messenger said. Buy for Me is integrated into Amazon’s shopping experience so that when customers search for branded items, they may see, along with results from Amazon and its third-party sellers, additional products from other stores in search results labeled “Shop brand sites directly,” according to the release. Customers can link to those sites directly or, if they see a link to Buy for Me, select that option, learn about the product, and then ask Amazon to use its agentic AI capabilities to buy it for them, the release said. If they ask Buy for Me to make the purchase, customers will receive an order confirmation email from the brand store and will be able to track their orders in the Amazon Shopping app, per the release. “Earning trust is a cornerstone for the success of AI agents, and we’ve designed this experience to operate transparently in its interactions with customers and brand stores,” the release said. “The customer is in control of the AI agent acting on their behalf, and brands have the choice if they want to participate and benefit from the increased brand visibility, customer engagement and sales.” Amazon said in February that it was testing the “Shop brand sites directly” feature that enables users of the Amazon Shopping app to find select products from other sites and go there to purchase them. With that feature, when customers click on the link to one of those products, they receive a notification that they are leaving Amazon, go to the brand’s website and can then make purchases directly from that brand. PYMNTS reported in December that AI agents will transform how consumers shop online. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Discovery also has had recent streaming success that could provide a buffer, but it still has a big debt burden that could make it vulnerable if the credit markets tighten, the analysts wrote.Netflix doesn't have the Disney-like moat of experiences to protect it, but it has a service that has reached utility-level status. That makes it unlikely that subscribers would cancel in droves, Morningstar analysts wrote.Bernstein analysts, however, wrote that Netflix's growth abroad could slow if Europe imposes retaliatory tariffs.

Rufus, a free service that answers everything from product details to special promotions, generates no direct revenue.Based on this metric, Rufus lost an estimated $285 million in 2024. By 2027, however, it is expected to reach $1.2 billion in DSI profit contributions, the document showed. The estimates, after operating costs and server payments, include the income from ads placed within Rufus' responses to user inquiries.The bullish forecast may explain why Amazon is aggressively expanding Rufus and its other AI search offerings. Amazon's leadership previously told employees that such AI projects are \"absolute\" top priorities.Rufus, which launched in February 2024, has received mixed reviews from early users, but Amazon continues to invest in this space. Just last week, Amazon unveiled another AI-powered shopping discovery app called Interests. Last year, the company disclosed that Rufus answered \"tens of millions\" of customer questions in its first six months of operation.It also shows how Amazon justifies its investment in one of its flagship AI products, even as DSI has received more scrutiny lately.Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment.'Positive lift on downstream spending'To be sure, Rufus's DSI forecast is small for Amazon, given the company's $68.6 billion in total operating income last year. But early results indicate Rufus has huge potential with more room to grow.The document said initial results showed customers using Rufus had a \"positive lift on downstream spending,\" and the impact only increased with more engagement.Amazon has significant expansion plans for Rufus.This year, Amazon expects $711.7 billion worth of products on its site to be eligible for Rufus's many features, like product recommendations and comparisons, up from $164 billion in 2024, according to the document. That number is expected to reach $849.8 billion in 2027.Amazon also wants to roll out Rufus to at least 13 international marketplaces this year, the document said. Currently, Rufus is available in the US, the UK, and India, and a handful of European countries.Amazon's Rufus AI shopping assistantAmazonThe document said Amazon plans to fivefold the size of the AI model powering Rufus, internally called Shopping LLM, to improve the quality of its answers. The increased model parameters to Shopping LLM were also factored into DSI, but it is unclear when this will be implemented. With the planned improvement, Amazon hopes to launch a new service that leverages Rufus to provide a wider selection and \"seamlessly purchase on behalf of the customer,\" it added.Rufus is already becoming more prevalent across Amazon. In recent weeks, some Amazon sellers who used the Rufus app discovered an update that auto-pops up Rufus when they use trigger phrases like \"how to\" or \"what is\" in the search bar.For some products, Rufus automatically launched with its own response before search results showed up. Amazon also started testing ad placements within Rufus's responses, Adweek reported in September.'Personalize more'Amazon isn't the only retailer with a homegrown AI shopping assistant. Others, like Walmart, Target, and Instacart, have launched their own AI-powered search apps in recent months.These apps may still be in their infancy. A recent survey by e-commerce analytics firm Profitero showed that just 10% of US customers used a retailer's AI chat assistant when searching for products. By comparison, 37% of shoppers used the search bar on the retailer's websites or apps, and 29% used promotion and deal pages.For Rufus, the other challenge is negative reviews.Andrew Hamada, a former Amazon employee who now runs seller agency Reason Automation, wrote on Linkedin last month that Rufus misses basic catalog information and often gives inaccurate answers.\"In our experience, Rufus rarely works,\" he wrote.There's also the question of DSI's true value.Amazon's DSI is not the most scientific metric, and several Amazon employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, have raised questions about the fuzzy math behind the numbers.For instance, it was never clear whether Prime Video or Amazon's shipping team should claim more DSI for the Prime membership revenue, which offers both services as a perk, one of the people said. Recently, Amazon has been deemphasizing Alexa's DSI metric, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.Still, Amazon's retail CEO Doug Herrington remains a strong supporter of Rufus. During an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, Herrington said AI-driven \"personalization\" is a major focus area for Amazon, mentioning Rufus and other search features as examples.\"AI is really allowing us to personalize more and more of the shopping experience on Amazon,\" Herrington said.Do you work at Amazon?

        "description": "As the weekend deadline for TikTok to find a buyer approaches, bidders for the short-video social media site are piling up. Amazon and, separately, a consortium led by OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely are the latest to throw their hats into the ring for TikTok. The site faces an April 5 deadline to reach a deal to find a non-Chinese buyer under threat of being banned from the United States. U.S. officials have raised security concerns over the app’s ties to China, which TikTok and owner ByteDance have denied. Trump administration officials are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the various options for TikTok. Startup Zoop, which is run by Stokely, founder of adult content social media site OnlyFans, has partnered with a cryptocurrency foundation to submit a late-stage plan to bid for TikTok, the two told Reuters Wednesday. A U.S. administration official confirmed Amazon had sent a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Amazon declined to comment, while TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Amazon rose about 2% following news of the last-minute TikTok bid. Amazon has long harbored ambitions for an in-house social media network that could help it sell more goods and appeal to a younger audience. It bought live video site Twitch in 2014 for nearly $1 billion and book review site Goodreads in 2013 as part of its efforts to build a viable social network. Amazon also developed and tested a TikTok-like short-form video and photo feed called Inspire that it shuttered earlier this year. Trump said last month his administration was in touch with four different groups about the sale of the platform, without identifying them. Private equity firm Blackstone is discussing joining ByteDance’s non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in contributing fresh capital to bid for TikTok’s U.S. business, Reuters reported last week. U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is also in talks to add outside funding to buy out TikTok’s Chinese investors, as part of a bid led by Oracle and other American investors to carve it out of ByteDance, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. White House-led talks entail plans to spin off a U.S. entity for TikTok and dilute Chinese ownership in the new business to below a 20% threshold required by U.S. law, Reuters reported last month. The New York Times first reported Amazon’s involvement on Wednesday. Various parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously, the Times reported. The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a 2024 law, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19. Washington officials have said TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance makes it beholden to the Chinese government, and Beijing could use the app to conduct influence operations against the United States and collect data on Americans. —Dawn Chmielewski, Anna Tong and Greg Bensinger, Reuters",

        "description": "Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced a slew of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—over 180 of them, notes CNBC. The tariffs Trump announced are higher than most economists and business leaders feared. Trump chose to hold off on announcing the tariffs until after the markets closed yesterday, and after seeing how those markets have since reacted, it’s easy to understand why. Individual stocks and the markets as a whole plummeted after the tariffs were revealed, and in premarket trading, those markets and stocks remain greatly depressed. Major American companies like Apple, Amazon, Nike, Tesla, and Walmart are seeing their share prices decline this morning, while Nasdaq, Dow, and S&P futures have fallen significantly. President Trump’s tariffs explained Trump’s tariffs were announced yesterday on a day the president coined “Liberation Day.” Business leaders, economists, and global heads of state were on edge before the announcements, fearing just how high the tariffs would be. It turns out, in many cases, they were worse than expected. President Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on nearly every country worldwide. That means that nearly every good that is imported into the United States will be slapped with a default 10% levy—a levy which will then either have to be absorbed by the U.S. company importing the product, leading to reduced profits, or passed on to American consumers, leading to increased prices. However, countries that were only hit with a 10% tariff could count themselves relatively lucky. That’s because Trump levied much higher tariffs against dozens of countries, which are also the countries from which American companies import most of their goods and parts. Here are some of the countries that got hit the hardest with high tariff rates: China: 54% Cambodia: 49% Vietnam: 46% Bangladesh: 37% Thailand: 36% Taiwan: 32% South Africa: 30% India: 26% Japan: 24% European Union (27 member states): 20% There are two big omissions from the list of key trading partners above: Canada and Mexico. Trump did not announce new tariffs on either country yesterday, but previous tariffs imposed on both nations remain in place, notes Reuters. Reactions from global leaders to the swatch of new tariffs have been vocal and swift. Many condemned Trump’s tariffs and vowed to retaliate in kind, leading to fears that an all-out global tariff war is about to begin. Foreign stock markets have already fallen today, but the worst fall may be yet to come when U.S. markets open in just a few hours. American stock markets—and tech shares—sink American investors are already not taking the news of Trump’s tariffs well. As of the time of this writing, America’s three largest stock markets are down a significant amount, according to data from Yahoo Finance: S&P 500 Futures: down 3.23% Dow Futures: down 2.57% Nasdaq Futures: down 3.6% But things are even worse for many big-name tech stocks. Here is how many of America’s largest tech giants’ shares have reacted as of the time of this writing: Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG): down 2.76% Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN): down 5.7% Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL): down 7.4% Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META): down 4.23% Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT): down 2.27% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): down 4.46% Shopify Inc. (Nasdaq: SHOP): down 10.13% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): down 4.84% Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA): down 4.86% As you can see, some tech stocks are being hit worse than others. Apple’s shares are among the worst hit. A significant reason for that is that Apple manufactures most of its products in China, Vietnam, and India—all countries that got hit with some of the most considerable tariffs. That means that Apple will either need to absorb those costs or increase prices for consumers. If Apple does the former, it will reduce the company’s margins and profitability. If it does the latter, fewer people may buy its products, reducing the company’s profitability. Likewise, NVIDIA and TSMC shares are among the biggest tech losers since their products rely on supplies from some of the hardest-hit countries, including China and Taiwan. As for Amazon, many of the goods the company sells—from tech to clothing—come from a number of the hardest-hit countries, including China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and more. Shopify is one of the hardest hit tech companies this morning, because many of the goods sellers on its platform offers originate from the countries that are hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs. As for Tesla, many of the components that go into its electric vehicles are sourced from overseas. Even tech giants that don’t generate too much of their revenue from selling physical goods imported from overseas—like Meta and Google—are seeing their share prices fall, because those companies rely on infrastructure made overseas, like servers, to keep their businesses going. Physical retailers and apparel makers see stock prices get hit, too But it’s not just America’s tech stocks that are getting hammered. Here is how many of America’s largest retailers and apparel makers’ shares are reacting: Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST): down 3.4% Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU): down 12.48% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE): down 9.6% Target Corporation (TGT): down 5.12% Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT): down 4.96% Much of the apparel Americans buy comes from countries like China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India—all of which were hit hard by Trump’s tariffs. It’s no wonder then that apparel makers, including Lululemon and Nike, are seeing some of the biggest share price drops today. And just as Amazon and Shopify are seeing large declines in their stock prices, America’s brick-and-mortar retailers are as well—again, due to the fact that they import many of their goods from the countries hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs. These retailers include Costco, Target, and Walmart. How will the tariffs affect me? Every American will likely be affected by Trump’s tariffs. This will primarily happen in two ways. First, Americans will likely see most of the goods they buy—from gadgets to food to clothing to cars—jump in price over the next days and weeks. This means Americans’ money will be able to buy less, and Americans with lower incomes will be hit harder than those with higher incomes because they already have less discretionary spending power. Second, as of this morning, many Americans who invest directly or indirectly in the stock market—whether through a brokerage account, 401 (k), or pension plan—will likely see their investments be hit. Those who don’t need to tap into these funds for years or decades may be able to ride out the tariff storm. But those older Americans who are or will be tapping into their investments in the coming weeks will, if the stock price declines today hold, see that their investments are worth less than they were before the tariffs went into effect. However, as poorly as the markets have already reacted after Trump’s tariff announcements yesterday, things could get even worse in the days ahead. That’s because we do not yet know how, exactly, other countries will respond. If they respond as strongly in kind—and it’s likely many will, including trading powerhouse China—then many experts fear that Trump’s tariff wars could lead to another global recession like the one the world has not seen since 2008.",

However, sources familiar with Amazon’s bid tell NYT […] The post Could Amazon Become TikTok’s New Owner? appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Amazon has reportedly placed an eleventh-hour bid to acquire video app/social commerce platform TikTok. The offer, as reported Wednesday (April 2) by The New York Times (NYT), comes just days ahead of a deadline that requires TikTok’s owner ByteDance to divest the platform or face a ban. However, sources familiar with Amazon’s bid tell NYT that parties involved in the negotiations did not appear to be taking the offer seriously. One source said the offer came in a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Amazon has partnered with TikTok in the past, agreeing last year to let the app’s users buy products from the eCommerce giant without leaving the TikTok platform. “Customers who choose to link their accounts in the U.S. will see real-time pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery estimates and product details on select Amazon product ads in TikTok as part of the experiences,” an Amazon spokesperson said of the collaboration. A separate report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) also touched on the Amazon bid, while mentioning another player: mobile technology company AppLovin. Sources tell WSJ that the firm has talked to casino magnate Steve Wynn about supporting its effort. WSJ noted that some analysts have called AppLovin a potential “next TikTok” thanks to its powerful artificial intelligence that can gather data on app users and use that information to tailor ads. The company has a market cap of $100 billion. ByteDance, a Chinese company, has until April 5 to find a new owner for TikTok. The ban stems from a law last year — supported by both major parties — calling for ByteDance to divest due to national security concerns. President Donald Trump, who had supported a ban during his first turn in the White House, reversed course during his campaign last year, pledging to save TikTok even after the ban was upheld by the Supreme Court. However, Trump upon taking office gave TikTok until this weekend to find a new owner. The president said recently that he expected a new owner to be named by April 5. “We have a lot of potential buyers,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “There’s tremendous interest in Tiktok … I’d like to see Tiktok remain alive.” Other rumored bidders include Oracle, joined by American investment groups such as Andreessen Horowitz, per recent reports.

        "description": "With the release of his latest book, Bill Gates is enjoying fawning profiles meant to set him apart from “other tech billionaires,” such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, who have all come under increased scrutiny for their recent turn to the right. While he may not be using technology to further political divisiveness, Gates does have an important kinship with his fellow billionaires, past and present: the paternalistic belief that his fortune, no matter how ill-gotten, is a good thing, because he’s using it to save the world. This philosophy was first laid out in 1889 by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, one of the richest Americans in history, in an influential essay titled the “Gospel of Wealth.” Carnegie’s response to the rising progressive sentiment of his day was to argue that wealth concentration is beneficial to society because it incentivizes innovation, efficiency, and economic growth—and it also provides a further social good through philanthropy. The harsh treatment of workers and environmental degradation became worth the price of thousands of libraries. Sound familiar? Today’s tech leaders provide almost the exact same logic for the legitimacy of their fortunes and as a justification for inequality. Influential venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, for instance, explicitly refers to this as a “deal” he believes exists between Silicon Valley and society, such that tech moguls should be given significant freedom to generate wealth through the innovations they create, and any negative societal or environmental impacts that result will eventually be offset by their future generosity. Andreessen says Joe Biden’s breaking of this unspoken compact is what led to his and other tech leaders’ rightward turn and support of fellow billionaire Donald Trump. But of all the philanthropists following the neo-Carnegie “deal,” Gates is the pacesetter, despite the fact that there has been significant criticism of this model. Carnegie’s ideas are so discredited that when I taught a class on philanthropy at Harvard Kennedy School a number of years ago, we read Carnegie’s “Gospel” in the first session as an example of what not to do. Not only is the idea that business success somehow gives individuals both the right and the expertise to determine solutions to vexing social issues problematic, the Carnegie model is a blatant guidebook for philanthropy-washing and undermines democracy by concentrating decision-making in the hands of unelected billionaires rather than public institutions. Like Carnegie, the start of Gates’s philanthropy was closely tied to significant critiques of his business practices and the source of his wealth. Twenty-five years ago, Microsoft was sued by the U.S. government for bundling Internet Explorer with other products in anti-competitive ways. When videos of Gates’s deposition for the case were made public, his image took a significant hit. He came across as evasive and arrogant, refusing to acknowledge basic facts, denying understanding of common words like concern and support, and often dodging accountability. While at the time he and other tech moguls were known as the “cyber-stingy” for their lack of giving back, like Carnegie he came to see philanthropy as a way to restore and eventually burnish his reputation. Today there are many public testaments to the work of the Gates Foundation. For instance its funding of vaccines for polio, rotavirus, and COVID-19 and its work on malaria and HIV prevention have been estimated to have saved well over 100 million lives. But like Carnegie, Gate’s work has also come under criticism for a selective focus, and reflecting a “billionaires know best” ideology. While Carnegie’s interest in building libraries and museums was laudable, it reflected his own biases and priorities, not the needs of the communities he sought to serve. At the time, the working-class and immigrant communities that suffered from his businesses’ employment practices often had little access or interest in these institutions, and would have benefited more from labor protections, housing, or public health infrastructure. Some of the Gates Foundation’s most well-known failures also illustrate an underlying imperial style that reflects Gates’s own idiosyncratic interests rather than grassroots, democratic solutions, resulting in questionable outcomes.The Foundation’s education reform efforts pushed for standardized testing and charter schools in the U.S., which ignored teacher expertise and worsened inequality. In Africa, it has promoted industrial farming and genetically modified crops—often against the wishes of local farmers who advocate for sustainable, small-scale agriculture—and a number of reports have shown that these activities have not provided food security. Similarly, Gates’s focus on addressing climate change centers on questionable technologies like direct air capture and geo-engineering that require extensive financial support rather than addressing emissions reductions solutions that consider climate justice needs​.Many of my students who had worked in nonprofits expressed significant frustration about the dominance of the Gates Foundation in skewing the nonprofit landscape to Gates’s personal interests, and further, how its bias toward quantification reflects a rigid, engineering-style approach to problem-solving that ignores the cultural, social, and historical contexts that shape human behavior. This is seen as a root cause of its educational reform failures. A focus on creating measures of teaching effectiveness and tracking them in detail led to stress for teachers, and contributed to “teaching to the test,” as opposed to more meaningful learning. This overly data-driven approach to philanthropy also closely tracks with effective altruism (EA), a philosophy that has wide resonance among the tech-elite. EA advocates a strict utilitarian logic to ethical decisions and treats problems as optimization puzzles rather than complex moral or social dilemmas. For example, its focus on assessing the outcome of charity based on the metric “quality-adjusted life years” ignores how such measures implicitly devalue certain groups—such as the disabled—and any approaches that don’t fit into a neat cost-benefit framework. Disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried was an effective altruist, and Elon Musk has described EA as “a close match” for his own personal philosophy. The level of hubris exhibited by Gates, Musk, and Andreessen when rationalizing their actions hasn’t been seen since the Gilded Age. But we can’t forget that there’s a reason why these 19th-century industrialists were known as “robber barons.” Our current era has much in common with Carnegie’s day, when leaps in industrial, communications, and transportation technologies transformed the ways that people lived, and also led to extreme income inequality and the rise of a new class of ultrarich entrepreneurs. There was political gridlock and significant backlash against immigration too. Eventually, outrage at the widespread and systemic injustice of the Gilded Age led to the Progressive Era. But will today’s polycrisis of climate change, economic inequality, public health challenges, and more create enough momentum for a fundamental shift in how we assess wealth and its sources? During the second Trump administration, it may be tempting to rely on Gates and his cohort of “good billionaires,” as newly elected Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin recently suggested. But there will be no 21st-century Progressive Era unless we start to question how one person is able to amass such wealth in the first place.",

        "description": "It's a decent e-reader, but it offers too few benefits for too many drawbacks. It has been a bumpy start for Amazon's $280 Kindle Colorsoft, the company's first E-Ink book reader with a color screen. The company delayed shipments for a few weeks to correct a problem where a faint yellow band would appear across the bottom of the screen, something that has apparently been fixed for current versions of the reader (Amazon says it has made \"the appropriate adjustments\" to fix the problem but hasn't been specific about what those adjustments are). Amazon didn't send us a Colorsoft for review at the time, maybe in part because of this problem early reviewers had, but we finally got one a few weeks ago and have been using it since then. My main takeaway is that I don't mind the Colorsoft, but it also doesn't solve any problems I was having with the monochrome Kindle Paperwhite, and it doesn't meaningfully solve the big problems with color E-Ink. It also makes the experience of reading regular text subtly worse, which accounts for the vast majority of my Kindle activity. I'm curious to see future riffs on the idea, but this initial implementation leaves me cold.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Statista’s latest report highlights the most favorite smart speaker in America, with Amazon Echo being the top favorite which is currently dominating the US market. The survey, conducted among 2,584 smart speaker owners in the US, found that 61% of the respondents love Amazon Echo voice-activated smart speakers running the Alexa voice assistant. The second most favorite smart speaker among US consumers is Google Home which is liked by 23% of respondents and runs on Google Assistant. HomePod, which runs Siri, and Nest, which runs Google Assistant, are liked by 16% of respondents each. Bose, which runs Google Assistant as well as Alexa, is a favorite of 11% of Americans. 11% of Americans also love JBL LINK Series smart speakers running Google Assistant and Siri. The survey also found that 75% of the people in the US do not own a smart speaker which shows that there is no room for market growth. Out of all the US adults who own a smart speaker, six in ten of them said that they own the whole system.The dominance of Amazon Echo in the US smart speaker market aligns with broader industry trends, where ecosystem integration plays a crucial role in consumer preference. Amazon’s aggressive push into smart home connectivity, along with Alexa’s vast skillset and compatibility with third-party devices, has solidified its lead. However, Google’s advancements in AI and Apple’s focus on privacy and premium audio could reshape the landscape in the coming years. With 75% of Americans yet to adopt smart speakers, future growth may depend on new innovations, improved AI capabilities, and deeper integration with everyday digital experiences.

        "description": "Tech companies are always trying out new ways for people to interact with computers—consider efforts like Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and Amazon’s Alexa.

But the most radical option has been tried by fewer than 100 people on Earth—those who have lived for months or years with implanted brain-computer… Tech companies are always trying out new ways for people to interact with computers—consider efforts like Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and Amazon’s Alexa. You’ve probably used at least one. But the most radical option has been tried by fewer than 100 people on Earth—those who have lived for months or years with implanted brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs. Implanted BCIs are electrodes put in paralyzed people’s brains so they can use imagined movements to send commands from their neurons through a wire, or via radio, to a computer. In this way, they can control a computer cursor or, in few cases, produce speech. Recently, this field has taken some strides toward real practical applications. About 25 clinical trials of BCI implants are currently underway. And this year MIT Technology Review readers have selected these brain-computer interfaces as their addition to our annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies, published in January. BCIs won by a landslide to become the “11th Breakthrough,” as we call it. It beat out three runners-up: continuous glucose monitors, hyperrealistic deepfakes, and methane-detecting satellites. The impression of progress comes thanks to a small group of companies that are actively recruiting volunteers to try BCIs in clinical trials. They are: Neuralink, backed by the world’s richest person, Elon Musk; New York–based Synchron; and China’s Neuracle Neuroscience. Each is trialing interfaces with the eventual goal of getting the field’s first implanted BCI approved for sale. “I call it the translation era,” says Michelle Patrick-Krueger, a research scientist who carried out a detailed survey of BCI trials with neuroengineer Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston. “In the past couple of years there has been considerable private investment. That creates excitement and allows companies to accelerate.” That’s a big change, since for years BCIs have been more like a neuroscience parlor trick, generating lots of headlines but little actual help to patients. Patrick-Krueger says the first time a person controlled a computer cursor from a brain implant was in 1998. That was followed by a slow drip-drip of tests in which university researchers would find a single volunteer, install an implant, and carry out studies for months or years. Over 26 years, Patrick-Krueger says, she was able to document a grand total of 71 patients who’ve ever controlled a computer directly with their neurons. That means you are more likely to be friends with a Mega Millions jackpot winner than know someone with a BCI. These studies did prove that people could use their neurons to play Pong, move a robot arm, and even speak through a computer. But such demonstrations are of no practical help to people with paralysis severe enough to benefit from a brain-controlled computer, because these implants are not yet widely available. “One thing is to have them work, and another is how to actually deploy them,” says Contreras-Vidal. “Also, behind any great news are probably technical issues that need to be addressed.” These include how long an implant will last and how much control it offers patients. Larger trials from three companies are now trying to resolve these questions and set the groundwork for a real product. One company, Synchron, uses a stent with electrodes on it that’s inserted into a brain vessel via a vein in the neck. Synchron has implanted its “stentrode” in 10 volunteers, six in the US and four in Australia—the most simultaneous volunteers reported by any BCI group. The stentrode collects limited brain signals, so it gives users only a basic on/off type of control signal, or what Synchron calls a “switch.” That isn’t going to let a paralyzed person use Photoshop. But it’s enough to toggle through software menus or select among prewritten messages. Tom Oxley, Synchron’s CEO, says the advantage of the stentrode is that it is “as simple as possible.” That, he believes, will make his brain-computer interface “scalable” to more people, especially since installing it doesn’t involve brain surgery. Synchron might be ahead, but it’s still in an exploratory phase. A “pivotal” study, the kind used to persuade regulators to allow sales of a specific version of the device, has yet to be scheduled. So there’s no timeline for a product. Neuralink, meanwhile, has disclosed that three volunteers have received its implant, the N1, which consists of multiple fine electrode threads inserted directly into the brain through a hole drilled in the skull. More electrodes mean more neural activity is captured. Neuralink’s first volunteer, Noland Arbaugh, has shown off how he can guide a cursor around a screen in two dimensions and click, letting him play video games like Civilization or online chess. Finally, Neuracle says it is running two trials in China and one in the US. Its implant consists of a patch of electrodes placed on top of the brain. In a report, the company said a paralyzed volunteer is using the system to stimulate electrodes in his arm, causing his hand to close in a grasp. But details remain sparse. A Neuracle executive would only say that “several” people had received its implant. Because Neuracle’s patient count isn’t public, it wasn’t included in Patrick-Krueger’s tally. In fact, there’s no information at all in the medical literature on about a quarter of brain-implant volunteers so far, so she counted them using press releases or by e-mailing research teams. Her BCI survey yielded other insights. According to her data, implants have lasted as long as 15 years, more than half of patients are in the US, and roughly 75% of BCI recipients have been male. The data can’t answer the big question, though. And that is whether implanted BCIs will progress from breakthrough demonstrations into breakout products, the kind that help many people. “In the next five to 10 years, it’s either going to translate into a product or it’ll still stay in research,” Patrick-Krueger says. “I do feel very confident there will be a breakout.”",

Amazon launched an AI agent on Monday (March 31) that can use a web browser to do things like shop for products and services on behalf of users. It can even place the order for you. Called Nova Act, the new artificial intelligence (AI) model can navigate, interact with and act on web content without constant human oversight. Basically, it can mimic what human users do when they use a web browser. For example, it can search for products, add items to a cart, check out and pay for the order. It can also track specific products across eCommerce sites to compare prices and monitor for price discounts. It can do things like update a consumer’s billing information across retail websites as well. Non-retail uses include submitting an out-of-office request, putting on a calendar hold and filing expense reports, among other tasks. “We think of agents as systems that can complete tasks and act in a range of digital and physical environments on behalf of the user,” the company said in a blog post. Amazon’s competitors have also introduced browser-using agents in recent months: Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. Anthropic was the first to introduce such an agent, dubbed “computer use.” Introduced last October, the agent can look at a screen, move a cursor, click buttons and type text. Google followed with “Project Mariner” last December and OpenAI came next with “Operator” in January. Read more: Amazon Launches Nova AI Models for Business Nova Act Is Different But Amazon said Nova Act differs from web-using agents of its competitors. It said AI agents that can perform multistep tasks for a complex goal — like planning a wedding — still need “constant” human supervision. Amazon said Nova Act can be more autonomous. The answer lies in how it’s structured. Nova Act lets developers break down complicated workflows into a series of single acts — such as do a search or check out. Developers can also add conditions to singular tasks, such as telling the agent not to accept the retailer’s upsell when it searches for a product. By structuring Nova Act this way, Amazon said it is creating reliable building blocks for AI agents. “If you have to babysit an automation, it’s not really an automation,” Vishal Vora, technical staff member at Amazon, said in a video. “That’s why reliability is the core of everything that we have built.” For example, Vora demonstrated how he used Nova Act to order the same salad for dinner every Tuesday night. The AI agent did the following: It went to the website of Sweetgreen, a popular fast-casual restaurant. It clicked on “delivery.” It searched for a particular salad Vora likes. It added the salad to the cart. It added a 20% tip. It clicked on “place order.” The AI agent will do this every Tuesday to get Vora’s salad delivered. It did not have to be trained on the steps beforehand. Nova Act is part of Amazon’s family of foundation models called Nova. Its software development kit (SDK) is accessible through nova.amazon.com for developers to use for experimentation and building. “It is an exciting step forward for rapid exploration with AI, including bleeding-edge capabilities … for building agents that take actions on the web,” Rohit Prasad, senior vice president of Amazon artificial general intelligence (AGI), said in a blog post. Amazon is doubling down on AGI. In February, it created a new artificial general intelligence research unit called Amazon AGI SF Lab. The San Francisco-based group aims to build “practical AI that can actually do things for us and make our customers more productive, empowered and fulfilled.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Amazon on Monday launched its latest AI model, designed to take over a user’s web browser and perform simple tasks. The move places the e-commerce giant in more direct competition with artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which are also developing AI “agents.” The model, called Nova Act, is currently available as a “research preview” for developers, meaning it’s not yet open to the general public. It can complete tasks such as browsing the web and making purchases without supervision. For instance, the company demonstrated Nova Act searching for apartments within biking distance of a specific train station. It can also handle more nuanced instructions like “don’t accept the insurance upsell.” “We think of agents as systems that can complete tasks and act in a range of digital and physical environments on behalf of the user,” Amazon wrote in a blog post on Monday. These types of agents are still in their early stages, but tech companies are placing big bets that agentic AI represents the next major frontier. OpenAI recently released “Operator,” a tool that automates web-based tasks, along with Deep Research, which it says can gather information from across the web and summarize it into digestible reports. Anthropic, the creator of Claude, and Google have also introduced AI agents. Nova Act is part of Amazon’s Nova series, first announced in December 2024, which is capable of generating text and images. “The Nova Act SDK is a crucial step forward, toward building reliable agents by enabling developers to break down complex workflows into atomic commands (e.g., search, checkout, answer questions about the screen),” the company wrote.",

        "description": "In a sea of more than 250 retail media networks, smaller players are pushing to take in more ad dollars. Despite there being a sea of more than 250 retail media networks, the reality is that it works out to be Amazon, Walmart and everybody else. Everybody else — in other words, the smaller players like Best Buy Ads and DoorDash — has spent Q1 of this year working to step out of Amazon and Walmart’s shadows and take in more ad spend. While media buyers and retail media agency executives say there’s a chance for these smaller competitors to achieve their goal and actually take in more ad spend, it’s unclear if their efforts, which include third-party partnerships and new ad offerings, will be enough to eat into the market share of the RMN titans. “If these small networks can play their data cards right, they can set themselves apart from Walmart and Amazon,” Cindy Meltzer, vp of research and analytics at ad agency Dagger, said in an email to Digiday. “Sometimes niche is more profitable than scale.”Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "According to a survey conducted by Statista’s Consumer Insights, people caring about their data privacy is something that varies from country to country. Recently, Amazon has announced that it is removing a privacy feature from its Echo home devices which previously allowed users to opt out of sending Alexa recordings to the cloud and they could process them locally instead. Even though this feature wasn't widely used, it still raises questions about data collection policies. Surfshark, a cybersecurity firm, revealed that Amazon collects more user data from other companies.According to the latest Statista survey, three in ten people in America said that they are concerned about their data privacy and are afraid that it can be misused. The people most concerned about their data privacy were people from Spain and South Korea, with 56% and 46% saying that they were concerned about their data misuse respectively. 42% of people from Spain reported actively protecting their data online, while only 24% from South Korea said so. 42% of people from Mexico said that they are concerned about their data being misused and 41% are taking active steps to protect their data. 36% in Germany are concerned about their data and the same number of people are actively protecting data online. 38% from India and 37% from China are concerned about their data being misused, and 28% from India and 27% from China are actively protecting their data online. The percentage of being concerned about their data and protecting it was seen as the least among the people in the US.

No complaints.\"Some shoppers even said the quality of the coffee brewed with the Ninja surpassed that of other machines they've tried. \"I usually never leave a review, but I must say I'm in love with this coffee maker! I needed a machine that could make a full pot of coffee and just a single cup as well…My husband and I like rich coffee and we aren't big fans of the Keurig coffee pods as they tend to taste weak,\" said another reviewer. \"Using the pods with this coffee maker comes out so much stronger. Maybe because of the three needles piercing the pods vs one in Keurigs. Or maybe because the water gets hotter? Whatever it is, it's great.

        "description": "If you’ve bought the antihistamine medication Benadryl from Amazon in the past few years, you’ll want to make sure to carefully check its packaging to make sure it is not part of the recall that was posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) this month. That’s because a select Benadryl product sold on the e-commerce giant’s website has a fault that could lead to the risk of a child being poisoned. Here’s what you need to know. Benadryl Liquid Elixir sold on Amazon.com is being recalled On March 20, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission posted a recall notice on its website for Benadryl Liquid Elixir imported by Arsell Inc. of Brooklyn, New York. The medication was manufactured in Canada. While the medication itself is safe, the Benadryl Liquid Elixir’s packaging is not child-resistant as required by law. This means that the product poses a safety risk to young children. If they open the product and swallow the medicine inside, they could be poisoned. “The Benadryl contains diphenhydramine, which must be in child-resistant packaging as required by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The packaging of the products is not child-resistant, posing a risk of poisoning if the contents are swallowed by young children,” the notice posted on the CPSC website warns. What Benadryl product is being recalled? According to the notice posted on the CPSC website, only one specific Benadryl product is being recalled. The details of that product are: Product name: Benadryl Liquid Elixir, 100 mL bottles Product packaging: paper box with a round dark plastic bottle inside. Label code: X003VRIGUL In total, about 2,300 bottles are being recalled. Images of the product packaging can be viewed here. Where was the recalled Benadryl product sold? According to the notice on the CPSC website, the recalled product was sold online at Amazon.com. It was sold between July 2023 and October 2024. The price of the product ranged from $16 to $19. Have any children been harmed by the recalled Benadryl product? Thankfully, no. As of the March 20 posting date, the recall notice says that there have been no reported injuries or incidents so far. What do I do if I have the recalled product? The CPSC notice says the recalled product should be immediately secured and kept out of sight and reach of children. People with the product should contact the importer, Arsell, for a full refund. You will be asked to provide proof of your Amazon purchase and proof that you have disposed of the bottle and its contents. Those with the recalled Benadryl can contact recall@arsellsupport.com to begin the recall process. Full details of the recall can be found on the notice here.",

Amazon is rolling out a feature to connect consumers to more of the goods they like. Artificial intelligence-powered Interests provides shopping guidance and product recommendations, according to a Tuesday (March 25) press release. “With Interests, you can create personalized shopping prompts tailored to your interests, price limits and preferences, from mainstream to niche, using everyday language,” the release said. “…Once you’ve created your prompt, Interests will do the work for you, continuously scanning Amazon’s store and proactively notifying you about newly available and relevant products, restocks and deals that align with your interests. Interests is available to a small group of U.S. Amazon app and mobile website users, but the company plans to launch it for all U.S. customers in the coming months, per the release. Other AI customer tools from Amazon aimed at enhancing the shopping experience include Rufus, AI Shopping Guides and review highlights. Meanwhile, chief competitor Walmart is accenting the convenience of its one-click ordering, same-day pickup and Express Delivery options to tie in with Easter holiday-related specials. “From budget-friendly baskets to an Easter meal priced even lower than last year at less than $6 per person, Walmart has something fun and festive for everybunny,” according to a Wednesday (March 26) press release. Here are other highlights from Amazon and Walmart this week. Amazon Continues Its Crackdown on Counterfeits Last year, Amazon seized more than 15 million counterfeit products and used AI tools to block most suspected infringements before brands needed to report them. These AI tools have decreased infringement notices submitted by brands by 35% since 2020. Amazon has also either pursued litigation or referrals to law enforcement against more than 24,000 counterfeiters since 2020. Amazon Fights CPSC Recall Ruling Amazon is suing the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) over a ruling holding the company responsible for product recalls of items sold on its site by third parties. Amazon said it’s a third-party logistics provider, not a distributor. In its lawsuit, the company accused the regulator of being unconstitutionally structured, aligning with the Department of Justice’s withdrawn support of the independent status of CPSC. Walmart Marketplace Sellers Now Have Embedded Finance J.P. Morgan Chase and Walmart launched an embedded finance solution for Walmart Marketplace sellers, enabling them to manage payments and cash flow directly within the platform. It’s available in the U.S. and may expand to Europe and other markets. The move seems to keep pace with the trend of embedded finance in marketplace innovation strategies, as these features can improve trust, sales conversions and B2B integrations. Tariffs Cause Pricing Friction for Walmart Suppliers To avoid raising prices for consumers and losing market share, Walmart is in negotiations with its suppliers. It could be an uphill battle because of tariffs that would potentially increase costs for suppliers. The outcome of these negotiations will decide when prices on products go up — and by how much — and could even determine which merchandise Walmart chooses to keep in stock. New Walmart Adventures in the Metaverse Walmart is partnering with Minecraft, launching an interactive gaming experience called Skyward. Players explore different planets to search for the “Golden Child.” In addition, Walmart is offering Minecraft-themed merchandise online. The move builds on Walmart’s investment in metaverse customer experiences, connecting the physical and digital realms.

        "description": "There has been an increase in AI crawlers on different websites and these bots are affecting the search ranking and speed of those websites These AI crawlers are from companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon, and are crawling on websites to gather data for AI models. For instance, SourceHut has blocked many cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud because they were sending too much bot traffic to websites.According to data from Vercel, OpenAI’s GPTBot made 569 million bot requests in a month while Anthropic's Claude made 370 million requests. Around 20% of Google’s search crawler volume is because of AI crawlers. DoubleVerify found that there was an 86% increase in general invalid traffic (GIVT) in late 2024 because of AI crawlers and 16% of these bots were from ClaudeBot, GPTBot, and AppleBot.Chart: DoubleverifyRead the Docs project reported that they have reduced their daily traffic from 800GB to 200GB by blocking those AI crawlers which has saved them around $1500 per month. AI crawlers are different from traditional crawlers in their depth and frequency and consume more resources by revisiting the same pages every few hours. SEO professionals and website owners need to manage AI crawlers while maintaining visibility in search results. Check server logs and bandwidth spikes for any unusual activities and monitor high traffic to resource-heavy pages. Using robots.txt and Cloudflare’s AI Labyrinth can also help in blocking any unauthorized bot traffic on websites.Read next: • American Support for the TikTok Ban Hits New Low, Study Claims• YouTube Updates Shorts View Count To Capture Every Play While Testing Variable Notification Frequency For Better Engagement",

Original films and series served as the foundation of Prime Video's growth into one of the world's leading entertainment destinations, and Jen's leadership is an undisputed driver of the success we've had in this space over the years.Having accomplished so much as an executive, Jen has decided that her next challenge and chapter will be on the production side, with the aim of getting even closer to the global creative community -- which she's been such a vital member of over the course of her career. As a result, Jen will step down from her role as Head of Amazon MGM Studios in order to start a new production entity, and we're so pleased that she'll continue to make her home right here on our lot via an overall first-look deal across both film and TV.In Jen's words:\"Since I joined in 2018, we set out together to create a new type of global studio that fostered an environment for the world's most creative talent to do their very best work. Along the way, we expanded internationally, built out a film business and hired and developed an incredible team. As I've been considering my next chapter, I've always been searching for that moment where I was positive that our work had set up Amazon MGM Studios for even more success in the long term. When I look at the teams we've put in place, our amazing leaders, and the incredible slate of films and shows we've got in the pipeline, I realized now is that moment. I'm looking forward to continuing doing what I love, cultivating talent, supporting their vision, and bringing compelling stories to audiences around the world.\"I can't say enough to express my thanks to Jen for her partnership. Starting with my personal Day 1 in 2020, her vision, creativity and industry relationships were (and are) so apparent that I had no doubt our work together could be transformative not only to Amazon, but also to the industry as a whole. The Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, Red One, Maxton Hall, The Idea of You, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Saltburn, Road House, Beast Games, Culpa Mia/Tuya and others speak to the hits under her leadership that have stirred cultural conversation and delivered incredible storytelling to worldwide audiences…and that list covers only the past 18 months. In addition, her leadership is evidenced by the senior team she's hired and developed…a team that I know will step up in a big way going forward.Speaking of that team, we will be taking a couple of weeks to have thoughtful conversations with Jen's directs and others to finalize the ideal long-term structure for the Amazon MGM Studios organization as a whole, and we'll have more to share on that work soon.One thing I did want to call out is the fact that — following Jen's decision to step away — we've decided to flatten our leadership structure a bit and not fill the head of studios role. In line with Amazon's recent work to streamline reporting lines and accelerate decision making, we felt this was the best direction for our studio, which will now operate as distinct film and television studios. To that end, Courtenay Valenti (Head of Film) and Vernon Sanders (Head of TV) will now report directly to me, while Sue Kroll will also continue in her role leading global marketing across both film and TV.I'm immensely proud of the momentum our team at studios has built over past 12-18 months, executing against our strategic plan and developing a fantastic slate of original shows and films that position us for even more success ahead.Please join me in once again thanking Jen and wishing her the best on this next adventure…thankfully, she won't be far away and we still have much to do together.-MikeRead the original article on Business Insider Jen Salke has announced her departure as head of Amazon MGM Studios.GettyJen Salke, who heads Amazon MGM Studios, is stepping down, per a company memo.Salke joined Amazon in 2018, and she's leaving for a production deal.Read the memo Mike Hopkins, head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, sent staff.Jen Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, is exiting her role for a production deal, according to a memo sent to staffers on Thursday.Salke is stepping down to start a new production entity via a first-look deal across both film and TV with Amazon MGM Studios, according to the memo.Salke joined Amazon in 2018 and helped lead Prime Video's growth.\"Following Jen's decision to step away — we've decided to flatten our leadership structure a bit and not fill the head of studios role,\" Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios head Mike Hopkins wrote in a memo to staff. \"In line with Amazon's recent work to streamline reporting lines and accelerate decision-making, we felt this was the best direction for our studio, which will now operate as distinct film and television studios.\"Courtenay Valenti, head of film, and Vernon Sanders, head of TV, will now report directly to Hopkins.Read Hopkins' full memo below:Dear Team,Since joining Amazon in 2018, Jen Salke has been a driving force in Amazon MGM Studios' evolution into what it is today: a world-class producer of award-winning films and series viewed by hundreds of millions of our customers around the world.

        "description": "Fertnig/Getty, Amazon, Ava Horton/BILee insists he's \"famously\" a very good Catholic. He's a moral person — his mother raised him right. And by his internal calculation, it's OK to shoplift from Whole Foods. Why? Because of Jeff Bezos.From about 2020 to 2022, Lee, a 20-something communications professional living in the Washington, DC, area, engaged in what he describes as \"grand theft auto-ing\" from his local Whole Foods store. He would cheat the scale at the hot bar, pocket spices, or take home four lemons in the self-checkout aisle while only declaring two. Lee has never shoplifted from anywhere else — not Safeway, not a local store. He's largely stopped taking from Whole Foods because he moved to a different neighborhood that doesn't have one. However, he told me, there's one by his gym he'll pop into — and steal from — from time to time.Lee has weighed the ethics of what he's doing. At one point, the guilt got to be so much that he confessed his misdeeds to his mother. Once he explained his reasoning — Amazon's market power, Bezos' wealth, what the billionaire has done at The Washington Post — she came around.\"If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too,\" Lee says. Lee is a pseudonym — the same goes for all of the shoplifters and ethically (and legally) compromised individuals quoted in this story. Over the past several months, I've spoken with nearly a dozen of them — some I found through their confessions online; others reached out when they heard through social media I was working on this story.Practically speaking, it's a good moment to be a billionaire in America — you've probably got more tax cuts on the way, and the president is nice to you as long as you're nice to him. Maybe your stocks are down, but you're still a billionaire, so it's fine. In terms of public perception, however, the superrich have seen better days. Americans are vandalizing Teslas to get back at Elon Musk. Mark Zuckerberg's \"Zuckermoon\" is over. As for Jeff Bezos, some people are stealing from him — or, rather, his companies — in an effort to exact revenge. Like Lee, they're enacting some moral payback, one fancy cheese from Whole Foods or fudged Amazon return at a time. They're sticking it to The Man, who in this case is one specific individual.These subversive infractions directed at Bezos and his billionaire cohort may be rooted in legitimate gripes with the state of the world and its unfathomable wealth inequality. On the spectrum of crime severity, swiping $20 worth of goods from a multibillion-dollar corporation does not rank high. But the justifications people offer are just that — justifications. None of what they're doing is actually making the type of impact they might like to see, and they're conveniently ignoring Bezos' positive contributions, such as his philanthropy. And they could be causing unintended harm to the non-Bezoses of the world, as in, everyone else. Many retailers have put items behind glass cases to combat theft, which is a headache for everybody. Shoplifting can demoralize workers, and if enough people do it, it may lead companies to raise prices, or in the case of return fraud, mean businesses make sending unwanted items back a lot harder.In the realm of retail theft, middle-class consumers and opportunist thieves are a growing group of culprits. It's difficult to tease out the exact size and scope of the cohort, given how incomplete retail-theft data can be. Amazon isn't exactly shouting its shrink numbers from the rooftops, and other companies have even admitted to mistakes in assessing the problem. But as one loss prevention professional put it to me last year, everyday, ordinary shoplifters are \"like a giant organized mob, they just don't know each other.\" If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too. Many of them abide by a certain code around who they take from, and the swath of small-time larcenists I've spoken to consistently say that anything Jeff Bezos-related falls into the \"allowed\" column. He's the second-richest man in the world, he's highly visible, and they don't love what they know about him personally. They feel like they're balancing the scales in stealing from one of his companies, undertaking some sort of Robin Hood-esque endeavor where they take from the rich to give to the poor, the comparatively poor being themselves.Take Jesse, a 30-something tech worker who until recently would steal entire bags of groceries from Whole Foods with his roommates. A friend at Instacart tipped them off to the opportunity — with so many personal shoppers roaming around the aisles, workers weren't going to notice another person loading bags or whether they were paying for what was in them. Once, they got expensive steaks from the butcher and left without paying for them, later grilling them out on a friend's roof.\"I never felt bad for the corporation as a whole, because it was Amazon and, you know, it was Jeff Bezos,\" Jesse said. \"He just profits so much taking advantage of the little people, so if we as little people can bite back a little bit, and that's me taking $100 maybe out of revenue for him, that's a little bit of a middle finger.\"Separately, there's Carson, another Whole Foods bandit whose friends joke they're actually \"liberating\" items from the store, not stealing. As Carson, a 30-something who works in the nonprofit sector, told me for a story last year, he likes slipping salmon lox into his laptop sleeve and estimates he saves about $1,000 in groceries a year by shoplifting, largely from Whole Foods.\"It's easy to look at him like a Lex Luthor,\" Carson told me recently, referring to the Superman villain.Carson isn't just extracting his purported payback through Whole Foods. He likes to throw big, complicated parties, so he'll buy $1,000 of decorations from Amazon, use them, and then return them.\"Who's actually hurt in this strange, dehumanized system?\" he said.Reporting for this story, I heard the same sentiment over and over from shoplifters and less-than-honest Amazon shoppers. One Whole Foods nabber, a 30-something tech worker, justified their penchant for lifting from the grocery store as a mix of ease, quality, and antipathy toward one of the richest people in the world. \"My lack of remorse for any of this is — it's a big corporation. They have so much money, eggs are $10, screw them,\" they said. I feel like the Batman of returns. I choose my targets. One 50-something business owner explained how they would exploit a loophole in Amazon's return system to get what amounted to free money for runs to an Amazon Go store in their office building. When I asked whether they felt any sense of regret, the answer was succinct: \"F— no. He's the most successful entrepreneur alive.\"Jimmy, a 30-something government worker, told me he's \"indifferent\" toward Bezos, and he does feel somewhat bad about engaging in some light return fraud. One of his gaming controllers recently broke, so he bought a new one, stuck the old one in the box it came in, and sent it back undetected. Still, he's not losing sleep over it. \"We know how much money that company makes. They're not going to be worried about that $70,\" he says. \"I feel like the Batman of returns. I choose my targets.\"The Bezos bashers' complaints ran the gamut: Whole Foods is a gentrifier; he's just too rich; shooting himself into space is gauche. Whatever anyone's precise justifications, there have been plenty of headlines and accusations that paint Bezos and his companies in an unflattering light. Amazon's e-commerce practices are bad for the environment. His businesses have been widely criticized for their approach to workers, including subjecting them to brutal work conditions and engaging in wage theft. His recent political turn and push to exert more influence over The Washington Post, which he owns, has turned many people off and reportedly lost the paper thousands of subscribers.To be sure, Bezos has also given people plenty to be happy about. It's super convenient to have stuff delivered to your door at the drop of a hat. Whole Foods is, for the most part, a lovely shopping experience. But in an era where billionaires are viewed as the bad guys, and there's growing anger about extreme wealth inequality, it can be easy for people to overlook any upsides. There are a handful of guys in popular culture who epitomize the enormous gap between haves and have-nots. Bezos is one of them.It is fair to wonder, though, if stealing from Whole Foods or returning a dress you wore to a wedding is the best way to get back at Bezos. It's a bit of a stretch to think the answer to that one is yes. The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable. I reached out to Garret Merriam, an associate philosophy professor at California State University, Sacramento, who studies ethics, to get his read. He told me there are likely three broad categories of thinking going on here. There are those who don't really consider what they're doing to be stealing — they're oblivious to it. Like taking a pen from the breakroom at work, they figure it's baked in when they grab a snack as they browse the Whole Foods aisles. There are people who recognize it's cheating, but they don't think it's wrong, given Bezos' wealth and his business practices. In a context where Amazon has paid millions of dollars to settle wage theft lawsuits, they figure lying about a lost package is a small way to try to even things out. And then there are those who feel a sense of political desperation — they're powerless in the face of massive political and economic forces, and this is an outlet for some sort of action, even if futile. \"The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable,\" he said.People have a tendency to try to neutralize potentially unsavory behavior by coming up with ways to justify their actions, Emmeline Taylor, a professor of criminology a",

Consumers are used to product recommendations from eCommerce sites that are based on their history of purchases. Amazon is expanding this concept to suggest a shopper’s next buy based on their passions. Called “Interests,” this new tool will match shoppers with products and deals relevant to what they love to do. For example, avid golfers get a heads-up about the latest golf clubs, or book lovers will be notified about new novels from their favorite authors. Shoppers create prompts to tell the artificial intelligence (AI) what they’re interested in and the assistant will be on the prowl looking for products and deals to suggest. Consumers can set price limits and preferences in natural language. The feature is rolling out to U.S. customers in iOS and Android apps and the mobile website. Find Interests under the “Me” tab in the Amazon app. The Interests feature uses large language models that can understand what shoppers are looking for. As an example, a consumer looking for top cosmetic brands will get product recommendations featuring the largest makeup manufacturers based on a web search by AI. Amazon already uses generative AI in Rufus, its shopping chatbot, AI Shopping Guides, which proactively consolidates product features relevant to make a buying decision, and review highlights. Damian Rollison, senior director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi, told PYMNTS that Amazon’s Interests feature is a step toward re-creating the in-store browsing experience and finding items serendipitously. He called this type of specialized AI, a “trend to watch.” Read more: Amazon and Walmart Go Head-to-Head Over Logistics and AI Claude Can (Finally) Search Claude, the flagship generative AI model of Anthropic, can now access the internet, at long last providing a feature that had been available at its top rivals OpenAI, Gemini, Grok and Perplexity since as early as 2023. Anthropic said Claude will also provide direct links to sources so users can fact-check. The results will be in a conversational format, just like ones already offered by other AI chatbots. However, internet access is only available for paying subscribers of Claude’s subscription plan in the U.S. For users of its free plan and for overseas users, online search is “coming soon.” Anthropic is backed by Amazon and Google, among other investors. Read more: Anthropic Inks Deal to Bring Its AI Model to Databricks Platform ChatGPT Upgrades Image Generator OpenAI is rolling out its most advanced image generator to be incorporated into ChatGPT. The image generator is embedded as part of GPT-4o, which is one of the model choices for ChatGPT, and replaces DALL-E 3, which had been the default option. The startup said GPT-4o does a better job of rendering photorealistic images, rather than the cartoonlike images that have characterized DALL-E generations — a dead giveaway that they were made by generative AI. GPT-4o also mitigates a persistent problem of image generators: the inability to spell correctly. According to OpenAI, GPT-4o “excels at accurately rendering text” and follows prompts precisely. GPT-4o can also transform uploaded images or use them as a basis for inspiration and can generate up to 10 to 20 different objects, compared to five to eight that is typical for image generators. These capabilities ensure users get exactly the image they want, according to OpenAI. The startup said all generated images are embedded with metadata based on the C2PA standard to identify that it was AI-generated. It will also continue to block images requests that are harmful and illegal. The improved image generator is currently available to Plus, Pro and Team subscribers and coming soon in Enterprise and Edu. Developers will be able to generate images using the API in the next few weeks.

The Amazon Alexa Fund has expanded the scope of its investments to include a variety of developments in artificial intelligence (AI). The fund, which was launched in 2015 to provide venture capital funding for voice and smart devices, has also been investing in startups focused on AI-enabled hardware, generative media, smart agents, AI architectures and other projects in the AI field, according to a Wednesday (March 26) blog post from Amazon. Amazon Alexa Fund Director Paul Bernard said in the post that Amazon and Alexa have already been at the forefront of AI, that the company sees opportunities for AI to make customers’ lives better, and that fund has expanded its focus without changing its commitment to advance the state of the art. “Some areas we think are really exciting include next-generation assistant experiences with autonomous agents that have specialized expertise and deeper personalization; on-the-go experiences utilizing new sensors and innovative devices beyond smartphone capabilities; emerging AI architectures that will deliver improvements in cost, speed and accuracy; AI-powered media that enable new-to-world experiences across media types and interaction modes; and embedded AI technologies, which have the potential to change how machines interact with the physical world through multimodal perception, advanced reasoning systems and new sensors,” Bernard said in the post. Four of the Amazon Alexa Fund’s latest investments include NinjaTech AI, which is working on an agentic generative AI assistant; Hedra, which is developing tools for producing video, images and audio; Ario, which has a personal AI assistant designed for parents; and HeyBoss, which has built an AI agent that can design and develop websites and apps, according to the post. “In addition to equity capital, we build a close working relationship between portfolio companies and the many Amazon businesses and technologies that could help advance their vision,” Bernard said in the post. Amazon has been deploying AI throughout its own operations. The company said Wednesday that it has been adding AI-powered tools to identify counterfeit items and to help brands and sellers protect their products globally. Amazon also plans to invest over $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, with the majority directed toward enhancing AI capabilities in its AWS cloud division.

        "description": "\"Double tap to page turn\" works on latest Paperwhite and Kindle Colorsoft. Amazon discontinued 2016's Kindle Oasis in early 2024, and since then, the company hasn't offered a new e-reader with physical page turn buttons or any other alternative to touchscreen input. There still isn't a Kindle with buttons and the feature seems unlikely to return, but buyers of the latest Kindle Paperwhite or the Kindle Colorsoft are getting a possible consolation prize in the new 5.18.1 software update: a \"double tap to page turn\" feature that will turn the page or move to the next screen when you double-tap on the back or side of the device. The 5.18.1 software update is available on all Kindle readers going back to 2018's \"10th generation\" models, but the double-tap feature only works on the newest 12th-generation Paperwhite and the Colorsoft, not on any older Kindles or either Kindle Scribe model. We verified this firsthand by installing 5.18.1 on a 10th-generation Paperwhite, but we also checked the release notes for each individual Kindle on Amazon's software update page. All Kindles that get the 5.18.1 update also gain access to new book summaries for \"thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books,\" aiming to make it easier to pick up a new book in an ongoing series.Read full article Comments",

The exact dates were not disclosed, but last year’s sale ran from July 16 and July 17. The move follows Amazon’s record-breaking Prime Day in 2024, when U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion online during the 48-hour sales bonanza, according to Adobe Analytics.

        "description": "A week after a tractor-trailer crash killed five people on Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas, a survivor of the 19-vehicle wreck has sued the transportation companies and truck driver involved. The post Survivor of massive I-35 crash sues Amazon, ZBN Transport for over $100M appeared first on FreightWaves. A week after a tractor-trailer crash killed five people on Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas, a survivor of the 19-vehicle wreck has sued the transportation companies and truck driver involved. According to the lawsuit filed by Nathan Jonard, attorney Bradley Beckworth said his client’s life “was forever changed by an act of unimaginable destruction” when Solomun Weldekeal Araya rammed his tractor-trailer into a line of traffic. The complaint, obtained by FreightWaves, seeks over $100 million in damages from Amazon Logistics, ZBN Transport and Araya himself – who was arrested a day after the incident and charged with five counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault. It stated that Jonard was southbound on I-35 when construction on the interstate halted traffic. At the same time, Araya was behind Jonard, hauling a full load of cargo for Amazon as an independent contractor with ZBN Transport. Once Jonard’s vehicle stopped, the complaint stated Araya failed to slow down or stop, resulting in a high-impact, high-speed collision. “Eyewitnesses later confirmed the horrifying reality: Defendant Araya never even touched the brakes,” the complaint stated. “He slammed into car after car after car, unleashing destruction across the highway. “The force of the collision caused Plaintiff to lose consciousness. He woke up in a mangled vehicle, disoriented, and in agonizing pain. His head and legs were bleeding. His ribs throbbed with unbearable intensity.” Emergency responders arrived and transported Jonard to Dell Seton Medical Center, where doctors treated him for a number of injuries from broken ribs and other bones and a herniated C5/C6 disc “causing excruciating nerve pain” and lacerations all over his body. The complaint stated that Araya failed a field sobriety test after the incident and a detective determined that he was impaired by CNS depressants at the time of the collision. “CNS depressants are an overarching category of medications that include sedatives, tranquillizers, and hypnotics, and are known to slow down signals sent between the brain and the body,” the complaint stated. Furthermore, the complaint stated that Araya had multiple previous hours-of-service violations and prior hazardous moving violations while operating commercial vehicles. The complaint accuses Araya, Amazon “and/or” ZBN Transport on several counts of negligence. “This is a tragedy for all involved,” said Beckworth in an emailed statement to FreightWaves. “And perhaps the most tragic part of it is that it was completely avoidable. Amazon and ZBN Transport used a driver who had multiple prior moving violations and had several violations for exceeding his allowable driving time limits in the week before this tragedy. And, he failed 6 different drug and intoxication tests taken after the wreck. These defendants needlessly endangered our entire community. On behalf of Mr. Jonard, we intend to hold them accountable and, hopefully, we can prevent other tragedies like this from happening in the future.” Beckworth asked anyone who has information about the wreck or people involved to call his office, Nix Patterson LLP. Beckworth added that he thinks this case “should serve as a strong message to our legislators who are meeting in session in Austin.” “Right now, powerful big money corporations are doing everything they can to limit the right to a jury trial in cases like this,” he said. “They want to limit the amount a family can recover for pain and suffering to $500,000 for their entire life. Yet, at the very same time, they are trying to protect big corporations from having a jury find out that they hire truck drivers who are on drugs and alcohol or who have had prior violations that should have kept them from ever being hired.” “Hopefully, when legislators see facts like we are dealing with here they will think twice before they choose big corporations who are trying to take away our right to a trial by jury,” he continued. “This is a horrible tragedy, and our thoughts are with all those involved,” said Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel in an emailed statement to FreightWaves. “We’re cooperating with all investigations.” FreightWaves has reached out to ZBN Transport for comment.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and agentic models are revolutionizing financial services, transforming user experience, fraud detection, payments innovation and compliance processes, according to John Kain, head of financial services market development at Amazon Web Services (AWS). “AI has been such an integral part of how the industry has modernized over the last decade. It really is in every part of the financial services value chain,” the former JPMorgan executive said in an interview with PYMNTS. “What’s dramatically changed in the last two years is the impact of generative AI on all those processes.” Kain sees three overarching trends across banking, capital markets, insurance and payments: End-to-end user experience: AI enables seamless onboarding, product recommendations, servicing and back-end processing. It is also powering hyper-personalized experiences, enabling firms to tailor offers, advice and communications in real-time based on user data and behavior. Data modernization: Legacy systems are being upgraded to unlock core data, enabling more personalized services and better analytics. Embedded financial services: Firms are embedding financial tools into broader value chains, meeting users at any channel, whether in eCommerce, social platforms or mobile apps. In the payments space, Kain highlighted the global rise of real-time payment systems, from India’s UPI (Unified Payments Interface) to Brazil’s Pix, which offer instant settlements and low fees. In the U.S., banks are now leading the charge, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence report in December. “These changes are transforming customer expectations,” Kain said, adding that innovations like buy now, pay later and stablecoin rails are creating new challenges for infrastructure and fraud prevention. Machine learning is being deployed to improve fraud detection — especially for instant payments, where there’s little room for error. AWS is also seeing adoption of techniques like distributed model training for fraud and clean room environments to share fraud data across institutions. Read more: More Than Half of US Companies Use Real-Time Payments Agentic AI Gains Traction Kain said that AI agents — AI systems that research, interact with other agents and complete tasks for the user — are “definitely the way the industry is going.” One common use case is agents that access internal information to serve customers more effectively. Kain cited the case of Remitly, a money transfer company serving transactions in 18 languages. For 95% of the remittances, it goes straight through without issue. But for the remaining 5%, there could be delays due to customer identification and other wrinkles, which erodes trust, according to Remitly. The company uses GenAI to help resolve cases by things like finding the right internal information to help the customer. Other use cases include: Call center automation: Real-time transcription, sentiment detection, and routing to digital channels. Compliance: Accelerates anti-money laundering (AML) investigations of alerts, in one case by 80% to 90% using LLMs. Personalization: Banks using AI can tailor marketing of not just products for the customer, but also optimal ways to pay. When it comes to accuracy of responses and hallucinations, which are critical for financial services institutions, Kain said that models have improved on this front based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and other techniques as well as having a knowledge base of trusted information. Also, AWS’ GenAI platform, Bedrock, has guardrails that use GenAI to detect hallucinations with a 75% success rate. However, “there is still a heavy human aspect” when it comes to important financial decisions, Kain said. Acknowledging concerns over the cost of GenAI, Kain detailed AWS’ efforts to lower expenses through custom chips (Inferentia and Trainium), model distillation, and flexible model comparison tools. Smaller, distilled models tailored to specific tasks lower costs while preserving high performance. Kain also said that clients can choose models such as Nova, AWS’ own family of large language models (LLMs), which is 75% less expensive than comparable models from competitors when it was unveiled last December. Also available on AWS is DeepSeek R1, from the Chinese AI startup that roiled Silicon Valley and Wall Street for its economic model. Kain said companies can use DeepSeek without concerns about their data being sent overseas. Since it’s hosted on AWS, the data stays with the client. “We let customers test different models and price points so they can optimize performance and cost,” he said. For example, Nasdaq was using an LLM for AML tasks but found the cost too high. It turns out they were needlessly using a very large model both for summarization and to write the final report that goes to a regulator or their internal audit teams. Nasdaq discovered that by using a much smaller language model to summarize the facts but use the large model to write the report, they can still maintain the same quality and lower the cost, Kain said. “By mixing the two, they were able to find something that made economic sense.” More customers will find their own optimal approach. “I think you’re just going to continue to see much more flexibility,” Kain said.

While the narrative of Amazon’s ascendance in discretionary spending and Walmart’s grip on grocery sales dominates the retail conversation, a closer examination of the latest PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Tale of Two Shoppers: Amazon for Discretionary Spending, Walmart for Groceries and Basics,” reveals nuanced shifts in consumer behavior and market share that hold implications for both banking and retail sectors. The report underscores the diverging trajectories of the two retail giants, with Amazon capitalizing on a surge in discretionary purchases to boost its overall market share, while Walmart’s growth remains largely tethered to essential goods. This not only shapes the competition but also offers insights into consumer spending patterns and the importance of eCommerce vs. brick-and-mortar strategies. The analysis, based on earnings reports from 2019 through Q4 2024 and national data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, paints a picture of Amazon’s strategic gains in capturing a larger slice of the overall U.S. retail spending, a market valued at $625 trillion as of end-January. Amazon’s fourth-quarter surge in 2024 saw its share of total U.S. retail spending jump to 10.7%, a 25% increase from the previous quarter. In contrast, Walmart’s retail market share remained consistent throughout 2024, with its fourth-quarter performance mirroring the rest of the year at around 7.4% of consumer retail spending. && The report highlights the growing consumer preference for convenience-driven purchasing, a factor that appears to favor Amazon’s frictionless online experience and Prime membership benefits. Getting beyond these top-line findings reveals several intriguing trends: Amazon’s Quiet Inroads Into Grocery: Despite Walmart’s continued dominance in food, Amazon has made a “meaningful boost” in this category, capturing 2.7% of the total U.S. market in 2024, up from 2.3% the previous year. This slow but steady growth suggests a gradual erosion of Walmart’s core strength. The eCommerce Divide: eCommerce was the engine of Amazon’s growth, accounting for 86% of its total sales in 2024, which reached $733.2 billion. Conversely, less than 5% of Walmart’s $559.1 billion in total U.S. retail sales came from online channels. This stark difference underscores the fundamental strategies of the two retailers. Holiday Spending Skews Toward Amazon: Amazon’s Q4 growth in consumer spending has been consistent, increasing from 6% in Q4 2019 to 9.9% in Q4 2023 and reaching 10.7% in Q4 2024. Walmart, however, did not experience a similar holiday-driven spike, indicating a divergence in where consumers allocate their seasonal spending. The report also indicates that Amazon’s market share gains are not limited to just a few discretionary categories. In the last three months of 2024, Amazon accounted for 3 out of 10 purchases of all electronics and appliances. Even in health and beauty, a category traditionally strong for Walmart, Amazon’s share has steadily increased to match Walmart’s at 6.8% in 2024, even surpassing it in the fourth quarter. In clothing and apparel, Amazon’s lead is even more pronounced, capturing 16.2% of spending in 2024 compared to Walmart’s declining share of 6.4%. These granular data points highlight a broader shift in consumer preference toward Amazon across a wider range of retail segments, posing a challenge for Walmart to adapt beyond its brick-and-mortar strengths and grocery-centric identity. Walmart itself has acknowledged potential headwinds, forecasting a deceleration in net sales growth for its new fiscal year.

Amazon continued its fight against counterfeit goods in 2024 by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools, seeing that counterfeiters are held liable and increasing brands’ use of its brand protection features. The company’s AI tools that proactively block infringements stopped more than 99% of suspected infringements before a brand had to find and report them, Amazon told PYMNTS in an email sharing highlights from its fifth Brand Protection Report. These tools have also enabled the company to reduce by 35% the number of valid notices of infringement submitted by brands, compared to 2020, even as the number of products available in its store has continued to grow. To hold counterfeiters accountable, Amazon has worked with brands and law enforcement on civil litigation and criminal referrals to law enforcement organizations, according to the email. Since the launch of its Counterfeit Crimes Unit in 2020, Amazon has taken those actions against more than 24,000 bad actors. In 2024, Amazon also identified, seized and disposed of more than 15 million counterfeit products. The company has also seen increased use of its brand protection features, per the email. These includes its anti-counterfeiting tool called Project Zero, which has been used by 35,000 brands since its launch in 2019, and its Transparency program, which has enrolled more than 88,000 brands and verified as genuine more than 2.5 billion product units. “Additionally, throughout 2024 Amazon helped brands and sellers protect their products globally with new AI-powered tools and a wide expansion of our brand protection programs to make it more difficult for bad actors to evade our detection systems, enabling us to scan our store with more nuance and understanding of context rather than just literal matches,” Amazon said in the email. Amazon is not the only eCommerce marketplace cracking down on counterfeit products, PYMNTS reported in March 2024. A Michigan State University study released in 2023 found that nearly 7 in 10 consumers had unknowingly bought counterfeit items via eCommerce channels at least once in the previous year. When Amazon launched its Counterfeit Crimes Unit in 2020, the company said it brought together former federal prosecutors, experienced investigators and data analysts in hopes of ensuring no counterfeit item makes it onto the eCommerce site in the first place. The company introduced Project Zero in 2019 to detect counterfeit products by deploying advanced technology, machine learning and the knowledge brands have of their own intellectual property. The civil litigation Amazon pursued in 2024 included a lawsuit against companies and individuals the company alleged obtained invalid trademarks or filed fake complaints to have Amazon remove their competitors from its store.

        "description": "AI bots hungry for data are taking down sites by accident, but humans are fighting back. Software developer Xe Iaso reached a breaking point earlier this year when aggressive AI crawler traffic from Amazon overwhelmed their Git repository service, repeatedly causing instability and downtime. Despite configuring standard defensive measures—adjusting robots.txt, blocking known crawler user-agents, and filtering suspicious traffic—Iaso found that AI crawlers continued evading all attempts to stop them, spoofing user-agents and cycling through residential IP addresses as proxies. Desperate for a solution, Iaso eventually resorted to moving their server behind a VPN and creating \"Anubis,\" a custom-built proof-of-work challenge system that forces web browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site. \"It's futile to block AI crawler bots because they lie, change their user agent, use residential IP addresses as proxies, and more,\" Iaso wrote in a blog post titled \"a desperate cry for help.\" \"I don't want to have to close off my Gitea server to the public, but I will if I have to.\" Iaso's story highlights a broader crisis rapidly spreading across the open source community, as what appear to be aggressive AI crawlers increasingly overload community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on vital public resources. According to a comprehensive recent report from LibreNews, some open source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI companies' bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "As demand surges, figuring out the performance of proprietary models is half the battle. At the beginning of November 2024, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected Amazon’s request to buy an additional 180 megawatts of power directly from the Susquehanna nuclear power plant for a data center located nearby. The rejection was due to the argument that buying power directly instead of getting it through the grid like everyone else works against the interests of other users. Demand for power in the US has been flat for nearly 20 years. “But now we’re seeing load forecasts shooting up. Depending on [what] numbers you want to accept, they’re either skyrocketing or they’re just rapidly increasing,” said Mark Christie, a FERC commissioner. Part of the surge in demand comes from data centers, and their increasing thirst for power comes in part from running increasingly sophisticated AI models. As with all world-shaping developments, what set this trend into motion was vision—quite literally.Read full article Comments",

But as The Associated […] The post Amazon Suit Challenges Product Safety Watchdog’s Constitutionality appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Amazon has filed a lawsuit in response to a regulator’s ruling governing product recalls. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in January found that Amazon was responsible for the recalls of items sold on its site. The commission had found last year that Amazon was a “distributor” of faulty products. But as The Associated Press (AP) reported, Amazon’s suit — filed March 14 — argues that it acts as a “third-party logistics provider” and thus should not be held liable for recalls of products made and sold by those third parties. The CPSC filed a complaint against Amazon in 2021, alleging the company was distributing unsafe third-party products through its logistics network. The company countered by saying the commission had no legal standing to bring the suit, arguing in a court filing that federal law does not allow the CPSC to sue a company “if it is acting as a third-party logistics provider rather than a distributor.” In its new suit, Amazon said it had issued recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns years ago. The suit also argues the regulator is an “unconstitutionally structured agency” that overstepped its authority with its January directive. “The remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,” Amazon said in a statement sent to the AP, declining to comment further. The suit comes one month after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said it would no longer support the independent status of the CPSC and two other regulators: the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The DOJ is challenging a Supreme Court precedent set nearly 90 years ago, giving certain independent agency commissioners job security, so that they can only be removed for cause rather than at the president’s discretion. The department plans to ask the high court to overturn that ruling. However, the DOJ now intends to ask the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling as it applies to regulators who exercise “substantial executive power,” Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In other Amazon news, PYMNTS wrote last week about efforts by the company — and rival Walmart — to employ artificial intelligence (AI). “Amazon is focusing on customer engagement and automation while Walmart leverages AI for merchant efficiency and product sourcing,” that report said. “Meanwhile, Amazon’s privacy changes in its smart device lineup underscore the broader debate surrounding consumer data rights in an AI-driven world.” The post Amazon Suit Challenges Product Safety Watchdog’s Constitutionality appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Best Buy is launching an influencer program, following a model popularized by Amazon and Walmart. As The Street reported Sunday (March 23), both those retail giants have programs that let popular internet personalities curate their own digital storefronts. Now, Best Buy is getting in on the act. “Influencers and creators will be able to build their own branded digital storefronts on Best Buy’s website, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement and sales,” CEO Corie Barry said on an earnings call earlier this month. The report noted that while most retailers don’t share how much their influencer programs bring in, the creator economy has a $32 billion value. And Best Buy has said it wants to open new marketplace opportunities this year. In January, the company announced plans for a digital marketplace platform where third-party sellers could integrate their products into the retailer’s website and app. The marketplace — set to debut this summer — is being powered by enterprise marketplace technology company Mirakl. In an interview with PYMNTS at the time, Alex Hase, general manager of the Americas at Mirakl, said the company helps retailers like Macy’s and Nordstrom expand their offerings by integrating third-party sellers, providing sellers with access to new channels and consumers. “Mirakl sits in the middle of this ecosystem, enabling traditional eCommerce to evolve into a platform business model,” Hase said. Best Buy’s efforts to open new markets come as the company — like many retailers — is worrying about the impact of tariffs. At the same earnings call this month, management said the company projects the trade war could cut comparable sales by one point. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research shows that while influencers do live up to their name in convincing consumers to make purchases, the full picture is more complicated. According to the report “Generational Pulse: Just How Influential Are Influencers?”, a large percentage of consumers make some purchasing decisions based on the recommendations, remarks or links provided by influencers. However, that share drops significantly when it comes to making regular purchases, with just 1 in 8 consumers saying that they listen to influencers when it comes to being incentivized to make frequent purchases. “And clicking through to the buy button hardly occurs in a vacuum,” PYMNTS wrote. “The data shows that 95% of consumers do some other form of research — leading to product reviews and platforms — in tandem with taking the influencers’ opinions into account.” The post Best Buy Courts Influencers to Tap $32 Billion Creator Market appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

An AI agent will […] The post AWS, Salesforce Execs See a ‘Fully AI World’ With ‘Limitless Labor’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Executives from AWS, Salesforce and Oracle believe that artificial intelligence (AI) agents will upend the world of work in ways people today might not expect. Consider the following potential future scenarios: You can talk directly to a software program to get what you need instead of clicking through menus and settings. An AI agent will take care of a customer calling into a call center from start to finish. Software integration will not be needed anymore because the AI agent will just click through the other software like a human would. Two years after the ChatGPT moment, “we have entered an even more transformative phase with generative AI,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS. “The emergence of agentic AI applications really represents a fundamental shift in its capability.” Unlike earlier generative AI capabilities, AI agents can reason, plan and complete tasks on behalf of humans or systems. They can research, pay bills, manage enterprise applications and even decompose high-level objectives into executable steps, Sivasubramanian said. Down the road, he envisions a “fully AI world” where AI agents make decisions, automate workflows and coordinate by themselves with less human oversight. “But this evolution is not a roadmap for the future. In fact, most of it is already happening today.” AI agents are helping biotech company Genentech automate drug research, saving nearly five years of work, according to Sivasubramanian. Credit ratings company Moody’s has used them to shorten its credit risk reporting process from a week to less than an hour. “This is exactly the kind of breakthrough in productivity and scale you’re going to be able to achieve with customers adopting agentic AI,” Sivasubramanian said at last week’s HumanX conference in Las Vegas. Read more: Deloitte Begins Rollout of AI Agents for Finance and Other Business Functions Salesforce’s Vision for ‘Limitless Labor’ Adam Evans, executive vices president and general manager of Salesforce AI, said the company’s AI agent platform, Agentforce, has seen “overwhelming demand” in the fourth quarter — its first full quarter of selling the service. More than 5,000 customers have signed up, which is “incredible early demand,” Evans said at a separate discussion at the HumanX conference. As more companies use AI agents, he said this becomes a “limitless labor” pool. Salesforce itself uses agents. For instance, an AI agent helps customers who have questions about the Salesforce platform, their accounts and similar queries. Evans said the AI agents resolved all but 3% of the cases, which are then escalated to human representatives. Evans sees the next level for customer service comprising of AI agents that can do more than just answer and refer queries. “Just like a brand ambassador, you’re going to have an AI agent that knows you as a customer, that can help sell, help understand your account, can escalate when necessary, and just kind of be a touchpoint the whole way,” he said. Evans cited three types of AI agents: External agent that interacts with the customers through chat, email and voice. Internal agent that interacts with employees through channels like Slack, helping them in their workflows and the like. Background agent that works behind the scenes to do things like look at sales leads in the CRM, do research and analyze client communication. Evans cited examples from early adopters like Wiley Publishing, which reported a 40% increase in customer satisfaction due to AI-driven customer service agents. Pfizer has started using AI agents to assist in life sciences as well. “We’re seeing customers in regulated industries as well” using agents, he said. Salesforce has structured its business model to accommodate this shift, introducing flexible pricing that allows customers to transition between traditional seat-based pricing and AI consumption-based models. Read more: OpenAI Launches New Tools for Building AI Agents AI Agents as a New Work Paradigm Miranda Nash, group vice president at Oracle AI, sees AI agents becoming the primary interaction layer between users and enterprise software, eliminating the need for complex interfaces. “Let’s stop adapting ourselves to computers and make them adapt to us,” Nash said. That means users might not have to click through the menus of Oracle software to navigate it. “In the future, we really believe you can just ask Oracle questions, and that leads to, behind the scenes, a rather complex, potentially multi-agent workflow,” Nash said during a presentation at the HumanX conference in Las Vegas. Today, Oracle embeds AI agents across HR, finance, supply chain, and operations, enabling departments to automate their own processes. For HR, it means AI-driven hiring processes; for finance, it’s AI optimizing accounts payable; for supply chains, it’s automated logistics management. Every role is being enhanced by AI, she said. Nash has the same view as Evans and Sivasubramanian that AI agents will fundamentally reshape employment. But all three downplayed fears of mass job cuts. “There’s definitely going to be some displacement and there’s going to be more opportunities,” Evans said. Evans highlighted Salesforce’s own experience: Employees previously tasked with repetitive customer support roles are now being moved into higher-value customer success and sales positions. Sivasubramanian said AI agents are enabling companies to streamline workflows, reduce training times and free employees from mundane tasks. He said AWS’s internal AI deployment saved Amazon itself 4,500 developer years’ worth of work and over $250 million in capital expenses. “I think that’s pretty incredible,” Sivasubramanian said. Said Nash: “The only option now is to get in the cloud, get to agents, and meet the future of this world of work.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Branded is a weekly column devoted to the intersection of marketing, business, design, and culture. Just a few years ago, iRobot, best known as the maker of the Roomba, was riding high, with annual revenue topping $1 billion; Amazon bid $1.7 billion to add it to the e-commerce giant’s home technology business. But that deal fell through, and now the Bedford, Massachusetts-based company has reported plunging revenue and steep losses, and recently warned investors of “substantial doubt” about its “ability to continue as a going concern.” With its share price down drastically, it’s now worth about $100 billion. How did the creator of the iconic round robot vacuum—which has sold more than 50 million units—get into this mess? Although there’s of course more than one answer to that question, a major factor seems to have been an ill-fated focus on dreaming up ways to move beyond the vacuum into new product categories—all the while failing to keep up with new competitors in its core business. Sometimes, those rivals competed on price, but Chinese brands like Roborock developed cutting-edge models praised for advanced technology such as a LIDAR sensor (generally recognized as more accurate than camera sensors) and other obstacle-avoidance and spatial-mapping tech. In short: as iRobot matured, it seems to have emphasized the wrong sort of innovation. (The company declined to comment beyond public statements about its earnings and recent new product announcements.) Founded in 1990, iRobot released its first Roomba model in 2002, essentially inventing a new “robotic floorcare” category: a relatively affordable robotic vacuum that whirred around on its own, sucking up dust. It was nobody’s vision of the future, but it caught on; some fans gave their Roombas names, treating them almost like techno-pets (and making endless cat-riding-a-Roomba memes). While it quickly attracted competition, the Roomba was long the clear leader, its name becoming a borderline-generic term for all robo-vacs. This popularity reached a peak in the COVID-19 lockdown era, when many consumers had way too much time to obsess about their domestic environments. By then iRobot had begun exploring (and pouring R&D into) new products, most notably a robo-mop, but also a lawn mower, air-purifying devices, and educational products. The company still looked like an innovator and its share price soared beyond $130 in early 2021, briefly giving the company a valuation of more than $4 billion. But the new experiments mostly didn’t catch on—while the robo-vac competition did. Several of the fastest-growing robotic-vacuum businesses are based in China, such as Anker, Ecovacs, and Roborock, all of which have eaten into iRobot’s share of the market. Lower prices were part of the equation, but competitors also brought design and technology innovations to the category, improving core functionality. While the whole category declined post-COVID, it’s growing again (in excess of 20 million units were distributed last year, up 11.2%)—but iRobot’s global share has shrunk to 13.7%, compared to 22.3% for Roborock. Amazon’s 2022 acquisition offer looked like a lifeline—but the deal fell apart in January 2024 under regulatory pressure over competitive and privacy concerns. Cofounder Colin Angle stepped down as CEO, replaced by Gary Cohen, appointed to oversee a recovery-and-turnaround mission. Since then, the company has scrubbed most of those new-category initiatives and cut staff by 50%. Fourth-quarter revenue dropped from $308 million to $172 million, with a loss of more than $44 million; sales fell 47% in the U.S. and almost as drastically in its various international markets. Full-year revenue for 2024 was down 23%. (Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has criticized regulators’ treatment of the deal, essentially blaming them for iRobot’s subsequent woes.) In its effort to save itself, the company has shifted focus (and more of its slimmed-down R&D resources) back to its core Roomba products. Earlier this year, iRobot said it expected to grow revenue through new (vacuum-focused) product launches, and has stated it is negotiating with lenders and actively exploring other options. This past week, it released eight new Roomba models, including mop-combo units—and its first versions equipped with LIDAR and “AI technology.” Prices, ranging from $300 to $1,000, seem more competitive with Chinese rivals. But as the company acknowledged in its earnings release, the fresh generation of Roombas isn’t guaranteed to save the day, depending on “consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” If the robovac pioneer can’t figure out how to navigate those obstacles, it may just get swept away.",

Artificial […] The post Amazon and Walmart Go Head-to-Head Over Logistics and AI appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Tariff pressures are squeezing the retail and eCommerce sectors. What are the two behemoths dominating the space, Walmart and Amazon, doing in response? The answer, according to the news this week, is doubling down on technology to enhance operational efficiency and making calculated moves to capture new markets in the face of ongoing uncertainty. Artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping the future of both companies. Amazon is focusing on customer engagement and automation while Walmart leverages AI for merchant efficiency and product sourcing. Meanwhile, Amazon’s privacy changes in its smart device lineup underscore the broader debate surrounding consumer data rights in an AI-driven world. At the same time, the companies’ maneuvers into new marketplaces, like Walmart’s deeper expansion into freight services and Amazon’s move into used cars, continue to illustrate the evolving nature of retail. As both companies introduce disruptive technologies and services across their respective landscapes, the implications for other businesses and consumers alike are profound. Read also: The Year in Amazon vs Walmart, and a Look Into 2025 Can Retail Giants Win in the Automotive and Transport Space? Deepening a commitment made over the summer to expand into freight services, Walmart recently announced a brokerage program to enhance its logistics capabilities and compete more effectively with Amazon. According to a Wednesday (March 19) report, to qualify, carriers must meet requirements including operating over 10 but under 1,000 trucks, maintaining at least five consecutive years of operating authority and carrying $1 million in liability insurance and $100,000 in cargo insurance, among other requirements. Walmart’s internal infrastructure and private trucking fleet is one of the largest in North America, and the company’s entry into brokerage could establish an attractive ecosystem for third-party sellers and other logistics and fulfilment stakeholders. Another intriguing development this week was the reported interest Amazon is showing in the auto market. On Tuesday (March 18), news broke that the eCommerce giant is eyeing helping dealers sell used cars, as well as new ones. If Amazon moves forward with plans to sell used vehicles, it could radically disrupt traditional car dealerships and online platforms such as Carvana. With its extensive logistics network, Amazon could create a streamlined, digital-first car-buying experience that challenges industry norms. Also on the car front, Walmart said Wednesday that it will open or remodel more than 45 fuel stations this year. By the end of the year, the retailer will have more than 450 Walmart Fuel and Convenience stations operating across 34 states. AI Is the Next Competitive Edge for Retailers Artificial intelligence has become the battleground for corporate supremacy, with both Amazon and Walmart deploying AI to refine their customer service, logistics and business operations. Walmart on Tuesday debuted a generative AI-powered assistant to help its merchants source items for its shelves and its online store. Dubbed “Wally,” the AI assistant generates insights from complex datasets, diagnoses why products are underperforming or overperforming, answers operational questions, raises tickets for unresolved issues and automates complex formulas and predictions, the company said. Across consumer and retail companies, 77% of business leaders rank GenAI as the most impactful emerging economy, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and AI-ID collaboration, “What Generative AI Has in Store for the Retail Industry.” Also on Tuesday, Amazon announced the next generation of Amazon Connect, launching AI-powered interactions that can help strengthen customer relationships and improve business outcomes. Amazon also announced that starting March 28, its voice assistant Alexa will process all voice interactions in the cloud to enable new generative AI capabilities, meaning users can no longer prevent their voice recordings from being transmitted to Amazon’s servers. On the legal front, Amazon on Monday (March 17) scored a victory with the dismissal of a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of misleading shareholders regarding its pricing and logistics strategies.

        "description": "At NVIDIA’s developer conference on Thursday, a large group of energy companies—along with a few technology companies—announced plans to collaborate on building AI models and apps aimed at improving the generation and distribution of electric power. The initiative, called the Open Power AI Consortium, is organized by the Palo Alto-based Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Founding members include Nvidia, Microsoft, AWS, and Oracle. Notably absent from the group are all of the leading developers of frontier AI models such as Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI. “This is about getting the right data, and getting it clean, so that it can be used for AI,” Jeremy Renshaw, who leads the consortium at EPRI, tells Fast Company. Renshaw says energy companies have mountains of data, but organizing it in a way that AI models can process is key. But already, over two dozen regional power companies in the U.S. have signed on, including Con Edison, Duke Energy, New York Power Authority, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Westinghouse Electric Company. EPRI President and CEO Arshad Mansoor said in a statement that the consortium will create an AI model, datasets, and apps to “enhance grid reliability, optimize asset performance, and enable more efficient energy management.” It will also foster a collaborative environment where utilities, startups, academics, and national labs can work together to address power sector challenges using AI. The consortium doesn’t include representatives from government agencies, but Renshaw said he’d like to see their inclusion. “We intend to include anyone involved in the making and moving of electricity,” he says. “Government is important because they do the permitting, licensing, and they provide regulations.” The announcement comes amid growing concern in the tech sector over the strain that AI workloads can place on data centers. (Google even pledged last year to buy energy from small modular reactors developed by Kairos Power to support its growing AI ambitions.) Axios climate reporter Alex Freedman notes that the power demands of the so-called AI boom have become a top priority for energy company CEOs in the U.S. Freedman highlights an ongoing debate within that sector over whether the power demands of AI will prolong the use of fossil fuels. Should that prove to be the case, AI could further push back constructive work toward climate goals.",

        "description": "If you’ve been on Google or virtually any social media website over the last few days, you might have seen stories about Amazon layoffs making the rounds. And if you were curious enough to click through to any of those stories, you might have discovered that Amazon is supposedly planning to lay off 14,000 managers by the end of this quarter—a stunning figure, even for a company as big as Amazon. But that figure is untrue. Not only that, it seems to have been essentially conjured up out of nowhere, before being picked up by a stream of headlines on Google News, viral Reddit threads, and would-be LinkedIn influencers dissecting it as if it were fact. In reality, what’s happening is less a story about an e-commerce giant flattening its management structure, and more a cautionary tale about how quickly and indiscriminately false news can spread in our current media environment. What did Amazon announce? The first thing to know is that Amazon did not announce 14,000 layoffs, nor did it say it wanted to trim its manager ranks by that number. “This claim is false and based on inaccurate assumptions,” Amazon spokesman Brad Glasser told Fast Company. “In September 2024, we shared with employees that we set a goal to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across our organizations because it was the right time to bring us closer to customers and reinforce our culture of ownership. There are a number of ways to achieve that increase without eliminating roles. We’ve now reached that goal, which we believe will allow our teams to move even faster as they innovate for customers.” The contributor-to-manager plan referenced in Glasser’s statement was no secret. It was the subject of a memo from CEO Andy Jassy, which was shared publicly on Amazon’s website months ago. In it, Jassy said the plan would “remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today.” Although that definitely sounds like Amazon was looking to have fewer managers, nowhere does Jassy say anything about 14,000 managers. And yet that figure was reported by a large number of online news outlets—many apparently based in India—just this week. So frequent were these reports that “Amazon layoffs” became a top trending search on Google. [Screenshot: via Google] Most of these stories contained vague references to sources, or no sources at all, with some simply attributing the news to “media reports.” At the same time, many of these outlets were indexed by Google News, giving them an air of legitimacy. And so if you were to scan headlines after searching for “Amazon layoffs” on Google, you could easily come away with the idea that Amazon is laying off managers by the thousands. We’ve reached out to Google for comment about whether any of these stories violate its content guidelines for Google News. [Screenshot: via Google] Where did the 14,000 figure come from? A reverse-chronological search of recent Amazon-related headlines reveals that at least one of the earlier stories cited Business Insider as the original source of the 14,000 figure, but Business Insider never reported that. In October, BI did report on a Morgan Stanley note in which the investment bank estimated that Amazon could save as much as $3.6 billion if it eliminated roughly 13,834 manager roles. BI’s headline rounded that estimate up to 14,000, but again, the story was not about layoffs that actually happened. It was about a speculative analysis for investors performed by a third-party company. What could likely have happened is that another news outlet misinterpreted the number, applied it to actual layoffs, and ran with it. It’s unclear which outlet was the first to do this, although India’s Financial Express website appears to have published one of the earliest stories. Its article, published on Tuesday, does not include any linked sources or even a byline. (We’ve reached out to the Financial Express to clarify the sourcing for the article.) Over the next few days, other outlets followed with their own version of the Amazon layoffs story. Those stories begot more stories, all citing each other or merely reporting the figure as fact. Cue the social media influencers, who presumably saw those headlines and used them as an opportunity to snag some engagement by weighing into Amazon’s strategy. Why is this happening and why should anyone care? Figuring out what’s real and what’s fake in our current information environment is difficult enough, but social media algorithms, incentives for engagement and clicks, and a lack of quality control on the part of large platforms are all making the situation worse. It’s not a new problem. Last year, we wrote about how a string of bogus stories about $12,000 stimulus checks from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) trended on Google for several days, driven largely by websites that had repurposed old URLs. But these phenomena are not victimless. False news can create real-life harms, whether it’s raising hopes among low-income Americans that a giant stimulus check is on the way to help them pay their bills, or creating unnecessary anxiety for people who happen to work as managers at one of the biggest companies in the world.",

        "description": "Amazon founder has executed a sharp public reversal in his relationship with Trump. In October 2019, Amazon sued the Pentagon, alleging that President Donald Trump had blocked the company from securing a $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of his animus toward The Washington Post and its owner Jeff Bezos—whom the US president derided as “Jeff Bozo.” At the time, the dispute was just one example of the near-constant skirmishes between Trump’s White House and corporate America. But the episode left an enduring mark on Bezos, the Amazon founder and the world’s second-richest person. Over the past year, Bezos has executed a sharp public reversal in his relationship with Trump—whom he previously criticised as a “threat to democracy”—that has surprised even longtime associates and has stunned the Post’s newsroom.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Ulta Beauty, the largest brick-and-mortar beauty retailer in the U.S., has become the latest retail brand to build out a third-party marketplace as the company looks to claw back the market share it has lost. Ulta Beauty, the largest brick-and-mortar beauty retailer in the U.S., is launching a third-party marketplace in a bid to regain lost market share. CEO Kecia Steelman, who was appointed in January, announced the new marketplace on an earnings call with investors last week as part of a larger growth strategy dubbed “Ulta Beauty unleashed.” The goal of the plan is to help Ulta navigate a rough patch as competition in the retail industry intensifies. With a third-party marketplace, the company is betting that a more diverse product offering will help it retain customers who may otherwise turn to Amazon or Sephora or TikTok Shop. Ulta’s marketplace is scheduled to open fall 2025. The launch of Ulta’s online marketplace comes at a time when Ulta faces more competition from rivals than ever before. Ulta competes not only with other specialty retailers like LVMH-owned Sephora but also major companies like Walmart and Amazon, both of which have heavily expanded their beauty and personal care offerings in the past year or so. Ulta is also fending off competition from upstarts like TikTok Shop, which has emerged as a top platform for beauty and skin care since it debuted in the U.S. in fall 2023.

Amazon plans to start helping dealers sell used cars as well as new ones, according to Fan Jin, director and general manager of Amazon Autos. Speaking on the Tuesday (March 18) episode of the Automotive News Daily Drive podcast, Jin said that adding used inventory for dealers is “really our next biggest milestone here.” Amazon wants to make sure dealers can sell as much of their inventory as they want through Amazon Autos channel, Jin said. Asked how the company plans to compete against the existing sites on which dealers can list their used vehicles, Jin said Amazon sees its offering as a way for dealers to have “a fully online eCommerce channel,” as opposed to a strictly lead generation site. “We think that’s valuable because demographic customer data tells us that more and more customers are very much comfortable with a fully online car transaction, even though that’s a very big purchase,” Jin said. “Customers want an omnichannel experience. It takes folks a while to make a decision, so they may start online, they’re going to go to the dealer maybe to look and have a test drive, they’ll come back, think about it and then finish the purchase online. We see that a lot.” Amazon aims to enable the online transaction and make it very smooth, Jin said. The company began rolling out the Amazon Autos offering in December, saying in a press release that it was partnering with automotive dealers and brands to bring the Amazon experience to the car-buying process. Amazon launched this digital shopping experience in partnership with Hyundai, enabling shoppers in 48 U.S. cities to buy new Hyundai vehicles from local participating dealers on Amazon. The company said at the time that Amazon Autos planned to add more Hyundai dealers as well as other manufacturers, brands and cities. Amazon Autos allows car shoppers to browse, order, finance and schedule pickup of the vehicle from their local participating dealer, all within the familiar Amazon store. They can also get an instant valuation and trade for their existing vehicle. For dealers, this offering provides a new sales channel and a way to streamline the steps involved in the process, Amazon said.

        "description": "It's hard to come by a more affordable bedding than this $20 Amazon Basics sheet set. It's available in tons of colors but does sleep warmer. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreThese $20 microfiber sheets from Amazon come in a variety of colors and patterns.AmazonWhile we think it's worth investing in great products to help you sleep (after all, it's something you spend a third of your life doing), you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get the best sheets. Amazon Basics, Amazon's private label for affordable everyday essentials, makes queen-size sheets for less than $20. The sheet set is one of the best-selling and top-rated on the site, with over 300,000 five-star reviews.Like other Amazon Basics products, which include phone accessories and cookware, this sheet set sticks to the basics. There's no marketing story behind it, no fancy, innovative features to wow you. It's a sheet set, plain and simple, and it has exactly the features you'd expect for less than $20.DesignThe sheets are made from polyester microfiber, which isn't quite as soft as cotton.Connie Chen/InsiderEach set includes one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, and two pillowcases. It comes in 30 colors and prints, from a frosted lavender to a deep burgundy, so it's easy to find a color to suit your personal style. The prices fluctuate depending on the pattern and color, but most hover around the $20 to $25 mark. I already own a good number of lighter colored sheets, so I got a set in Plum. The sheets are made from polyester in an OEKO-Tex Standard 100-certified factory. The fitted sheet was easy to put on my 12-inch tall mattress and stays snug around it. The sheet can fit on mattresses up to 14 inches thick. Our review of the Amazon Basics Sheet SetEach set includes a fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases.AmazonComfortOverall, I've had a good experience sleeping on these sheets. They're soft and comfortable, though they're not the most breathable I've tried. Even though I tend not to sleep hot, I can see someone overheating in them. While some reviewers took issue with how thin the sheets were, I personally thought the thickness was fine. They're also a bit wrinkly and that problem might be exacerbated by the fact that I got a darker color. If you care about the appearance of your sheets, I would suggest getting a lighter color or a printed style. Comparing these sheets to sets I've tried that cost 10 to 15 times more, I do think there's a noticeable difference. Sheets that I've tried for our best sheets guide from brands like Parachute, Brooklinen, and Frette are indeed better — they're softer, more breathable, and more durable. CareAnother perk of this sheet set is its ease of cleaning. Rather than requiring the cold water cycle or low heat in the dryer, these sheets can be washed and dried in your washer and dryer at normal settings. The product description notes that they're shrink resistant, too.ValueAt less than $20 for a queen-sized set, it's difficult to find a pair of sheets at a better value that the Amazon Basics sheets. While not the best sheets we've ever tested, they are surprisingly good quality for the price.Because the sheet set is sold on Amazon, they have 30-day returns. If you're not happy with your sheets within the first 30 days, you can get a replacement or refund at no cost.Cons to considerThese sheets are not breathable, which could be a major issue if you sleep hot. If you are looking for cooling sheets for the summer months, we don't recommend the Amazon Basics sheets.Durability-wise, you get what you pay for when buying sheets. These sheets aren't the best option if you're looking for a product that will last for years. They are also prone to wrinkling, so keep that in mind if you like aesthetic, crisp bedding.What are your alternatives?While it's difficult to find sheets that match the value of the Amazon Basics sheet set, there are plenty of other budget options available. We picked Target's Threshold Performance Sheet Set as the best budget option in our best sheets guide. These $60 cotton sheets have a sateen weave, so they are silky-soft and smooth, as detailed by our reviewer in her review.If you sleep hot, the Mellani Iconic Collection Sheet Set, which are featured in our best cooling sheets guide, is similar to the Amazon Basics sheet set in terms of its microfiber construction and wide array of colors. However, we found the set to sleep far cooler and moisture-wicking.The bottom lineYou really can't beat the value of these sheets. Twenty dollars is a great deal for a full sheet set, and I love that there are so many color and print options. The soft and comfortable material might not last a lifetime of uses and washes, but it's the perfect short-term bedding solution for kids' bedrooms, dorms and college apartments, and guest rooms. It's one of the best budget sheet options you can buy online right now, from a brand with a lot of experience making these types of affordable essentials.

        "description": "I tasted and reviewed chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods to find the best option for a quick lunch. After trying four different options, I found the best chicken salad to buy at the grocery store.Ted BergI tried chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods.The Wegmans option was pretty expensive and didn't have a ton of flavor.However, I enjoyed the Whole Foods chicken salad, which was scooped fresh at the deli counter.I never enjoyed chicken salad until I started working at a deli in my early 20s. It quickly became a lunch staple for me, even though I had so many other sandwich options at my fingertips.Nowadays, I usually get my chicken salad fix at home when I have leftover grilled or rotisserie chicken. However, I wanted to see if I could find something worthwhile at the supermarket to enter my lunch rotation.So, I visited four major supermarket chains — Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods — and bought premade chicken salad at each one.I taste-tested all four with some crackers and ranked them from worst to first. Here's how they stacked up.I wouldn't buy the Wegmans grilled chicken salad again.I didn't think the Wegmans chicken salad had a ton of flavor.Ted BergWhen I visited Wegmans, a 16-ounce tub of grilled chicken salad cost $15. Since that price seemed borderline outrageous, I hoped the chicken salad would be delicious.However, I was disappointed. There wasn't much flavor to it at all — the prevailing taste was that of mayonnaise — and it had an oddly grainy texture that closely resembled tuna salad.There was a good amount of chicken in the mix, which might help explain the price, but the meat lacked flavor and wasn't especially moist. The price point, more than the chicken salad itself, earned Wegmans the bottom spot on my ranking.Trader Joe's Wine Country chicken salad was too sweet for me.Trader Joe's Wine Country chicken salad had sweetened dried cranberries and pecans.Ted BergAcross multiple visits to three separate Trader Joe's in my area, the closest option I found to the others on this list was the Wine Country chicken salad. However, it differed slightly from the others as it incorporated sweetened dried cranberries and pecans.At first, I thought that might give it an unfair advantage in the ranking, since I normally enjoy a chicken salad with dried cranberries. The $5 price also seemed like a good deal for a 12-ounce container.However, this chicken salad was way too sweet for my taste and not quite hearty enough. It seemed like there was a lot more goopy liquid than chunks of chicken, and the cranberries tasted like candy.Overall, I thought this tasted more like a salad dressing than a deli salad.Costco's chicken salad was just OK.The Kirkland Signature chicken salad was greasy. Ted BergI found the Kirkland Signature chicken salad in Costco's prepared foods section. It was priced at $6 a pound, making it the least-expensive option I tried on a per-pound basis. The container I picked up contained about 2 pounds of chicken salad.The salad had the biggest chunks of chicken of any I tried by far, but it practically shimmered with grease.I also thought it was bland in terms of flavor. However, since I was already familiar with the Kirkland Signature rotisserie chicken, the briny, brothy flavor of the meat was easy to pick out.There was celery in the mix, but it added more flavor than texture; ideally, I'd prefer that reversed.The chicken salad was fine but not especially good, and it's hard to imagine a situation in which I'd want two pounds of it. I'd buy the Whole Foods classic chicken salad again.The chicken salad from Whole Foods was scooped fresh at the deli counter.Ted BergOf the four chicken salads I tried, the version from Whole Foods was the only one that was scooped fresh at a deli counter. It was also the only one I'd consider buying again.At $14 per pound, it was significantly more expensive than the chicken salads from Costco and Trader Joe's but slightly less expensive than the one from Wegmans. I appreciated that I could order only as much as I needed — a half-pound, in this case.It was easily the best-tasting of the four salads I tried. The chicken, chopped up into bite-sized pieces, was moist and tasted fresh. Although hardly bold in flavor, the salad was nuanced with the earthy sweetness of red onions, notes of rosemary, and a touch of mustardy bite.Unlike the others, it tasted better than anything I could easily make at home.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Amazon's Omni Mini LED TV offers a big step up in performance compared to its other smart TV models, but it's beaten by similarly priced competitors. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreThe Fire TV Omni Mini LED is Amazon's new flagship 4K TV model.David Murphy/Business InsiderAmazon's latest 4K smart TV is its most advanced model yet. Called the Fire TV Omni Mini LED, this flagship QLED display delivers a brighter picture and higher contrast than anything the brand has released so far. Of course, it's also the company's most expensive TV, starting at $900 for the 55-inch size and maxing out at $2,400 for an 85-inch panel.To determine whether the Omni Mini LED is worth the price of admission, I put the 55-inch model to the test, evaluating its picture quality, usability, and overall value. As long as you use the right settings, the TV offers solid image performance, but Amazon's finicky Fire OS (operating system) isn't my favorite smart TV interface to use.I just find the system to be too cluttered when navigating its many screens, menus, and apps. The Omni Mini LED's homepage also suffers from ugly advertising front and center. On the other hand, I do like the TV's Alexa integration, which makes it easy to use the display to control other compatible smart home devices.If you can look beyond the Fire TV OS' shortcomings and avoid enabling some of the TV's superfluous features, the Omni Mini LED is a good midrange offering. It's easily the best TV in Amazon's lineup. However, it's a bit pricey compared to similar offerings from TCL and Hisense, so I recommend snagging this set when it's discounted during one of Amazon's sales.Specifications are competitive for this classThe TV's feet lift the display high enough to fit an average soundbar in front.David Murphy/Business InsiderAmazon's Fire TV Omni Mini LED TV has all the specs you should expect from a model in this class. The TV is available in four different sizes — 55, 65, 75, or 85 inches. All four options use a QLED panel with a Mini LED backlight and local dimming. Though Amazon's step-down Fire TV Omni QLED model also has local dimming, that set uses regular-sized LEDs rather than Mini LEDs. With Mini LEDs, this pricier model is able to deliver higher contrast since the TV can automatically adjust its backlight across more zones on its screen.With a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, Amazon's TV is also primed for gaming. If you have a PS5 or Xbox Series X, you'll get 120Hz support with a variable refresh rate (VRR) to enable smooth performance. And if you have a powerful enough PC, you can unlock the TV's full 144Hz mode.Four HDMI ports (two 2.1, two 2.0) give you plenty of options for your home entertainment center. The TV's feet prop the display up enough that you have plenty of space to stash a soundbar underneath it. At a mere 35 pounds, the 55-inch model isn't very difficult to pick up and adjust (or wall-mount).The Omni Mini LED includes support for an over-the-air antenna, which you can connect to pull in free, local signals (supplementing an already extensive list of free, live content you can get via apps like Fire TV Channels, Freevee, and Prime Video). The antenna isn't included, naturally, but it's an inexpensive add-on if you don't want to pay a monthly fee for local channels.The TV also does a great job of managing other critical gear in your home entertainment center, like your cable/satellite box and receiver. I had no issues getting the Omni Mini LED synced with my Denon AV receiver, and the TV's HDMI eARC connection allowed me to use the included Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced to power the receiver on and off.It's also easy to control the receiver's volume using the remote, and the TV comes with plenty of options for fine-tuning infrared controls to support all kinds of different setups. That said, I wish Amazon had thrown its Alexa Voice Remote Pro in the box instead. The Pro Remote is a fun upgrade that has backlit buttons and a lost remote chime.Like most TVs, Amazon's Omni Mini LED 4K is packed with adjustable settings. The most critical one is found within the display settings menu, where you'll get a number of different presets to choose from depending on what you're watching (SDR, HDR, Dolby Vision, etc.).To get the most accurate performance out of the box, I recommend selecting the aptly named Filmmaker mode for everything you do. Of course, if you don't like the look of FilmMaker mode, you can select from several other presets, such as Standard, Movie Bright, Movie Dark, and Vivid.The TV delivers solid color accuracy, but there are brighter sets that cost lessThe Fire TV Omni Mini LED has noticeably better picture quality than Amazon's other smart TV models.David Murphy/Business InsiderTo evaluate the Fire TV Omni Mini LED's image quality, I used test patterns and watched various movies and TV shows. I measured the display's HDR picture accuracy in Filmmaker mode using Portrait Displays' Calman software. What I found was that the TV's grayscale and color performance both delivered solid accuracy out of the box.In Filmmaker mode, the TV delivered an average DeltaE of 2.7 for grayscale and 2.5 for color. These measurements describe how far away a tested color is from what its true value should be. A DeltaE under three is what you're looking for; the higher you go over five, the more noticeable color errors become. So, the Omni Mini LED's Filmmaker mode is quite good. However, the same can't be said for the TV's other presets.When I switched to the Standard picture mode with HDR enabled and remeasured, it was practically night and day. I recorded an average DeltaE of 8.6 for grayscale and 7.9 for colors. The TV's Movie Bright and Movie Dark modes didn't fare any better than Standard. The Vivid preset, though eye-poppingly saturated, was twice as bad for accuracy as Standard — virtually unusable unless you heavily favor brightness over accuracy.And I don't say that to be flippant. Even in Filmmaker mode, I found myself wishing the TV had a little more saturation in certain scenes, like during lightsaber battles in the latest \"Star Wars\" films and TV shows. That's easy enough to adjust using the Omni Mini LED's various settings, but Filmmaker mode is a great starting point for viewers who favor an accurate image. There's also an \"Intelligent Picture\" feature that can change settings like brightness and color intensity based on a sensor that evaluates your room's conditions.The TV's local dimming feature defaults to different levels depending on the format of whatever you're watching, but you can manually adjust it to your taste. I found the high setting made the TV's contrast feel overwhelming when watching Dolby Vision HDR movies like \"Dune.\" I ended up settling on medium for the best balance, as this yielded rich, vibrant visuals without making it feel like I was staring into the sun. I didn't notice any egregious signs of blooming (halos around bright objects) with the set in this dimming mode. Instead, when the Harkonnens sacked Arrakis in \"Dune,\" the Omni Mini LED presented the epic battle with great HDR imagery.This impressive HDR performance is, in part, the result of the Omni Mini LED's solid brightness capabilities. I measured the TV's brightness across both SDR and HDR signals. In Filmmaker mode, a 10% window reached a peak of 1,058 nits in HDR using the default 70% backlight setting. When I cranked the backlight to 100% on Filmmaker mode, the TV's peak brightness increased to 1,422 nits. When I blasted the entire screen with a white box, the TV was able to display a max of 694 nits.I also repeated the same tests for SDR, which is the mode that most broadcast TV sources, like cable and satellite, often use. I measured 714 nits on default settings with a 10% window, and 958 nits when I maximized the backlight. On a completely white screen, the maximum measured brightness dropped to 380 and 515 nits, respectively.Those brightness numbers are solid for a TV in this class, and they're more than double what Amazon's step-down Fire TV Omni QLED can deliver. This level of brightness is enough to deliver great HDR performance and help overcome glare in rooms with lots of windows. However, the TV does track a little bit below expected brightness levels for low-to-medium shades of gray.It's also important to note that the Omni Mini LED isn't the brightest or most eye-catching TV at its price point. For instance, the TCL QM7 Mini LED TV offers a peak of around 1,700 nits in HDR. The QM7 launched for around the same price as the Omni Mini LED last year, but it's now sold for a lot less. From a picture quality standpoint, similarly priced sets from brands like TCL and Hisense have a slight edge over Amazon's TV.Alexa integration works great for controlling your smart devicesYou can access Alexa via hands-free microphones built into the TV.David Murphy/Business InsiderThe Omni Mini LED integrates the full powers of Alexa directly into the TV. You can speak prompts to the digital assistant whether your TV's screen is on or off, and it'll reply via the built-in speakers. However, if you're connected to a separate sound system, like a receiver or soundbar, those components will need to be left on in order to hear Alexa. If your TV is on when you're talking to Alexa, you may even get a visual element on the screen to complement whatever you asked (for example, a week's worth of weather temperatures and condition icons).The TV also gives you the same smart home powers you'd get from a conventional Echo speaker or display. This means you can set up all your compatible smart gear within the Alexa app and then adjust temperatures, turn lights on and off, and open garage doors — to name a few — by talking to your TV. You can even connect compatible security cameras and pull up a live feed directly on the display. (Sadly, there's no way to automat",

        "description": "In an industrial park in North Las Vegas, near an Amazon warehouse and a waste storage facility, a new carbon removal plant is beginning to pull CO2 from the air and store it permanently. Called Project Juniper, it’s the first “integrated” plant of its kind in the U.S., meaning that it handles both carbon capture and storage in one place. (As a bonus, it also generates clean water.) Clairity Tech, the startup behind it, designed the new plant after raising a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital and Lowercarbon Capital last year. After spending the last few months setting up the facility, it ran its full system for the first time last week. Founder Glen Meyerowitz, who previously worked on rocket and spacecraft propulsion testing at SpaceX, pivoted to carbon removal in 2022. “As I look at it, this is really the existential threat of our time and the most important problem that needs to be addressed,” he says. In order for the world to have any chance of meeting climate goals, CO2 needs to be captured from the air at a massive scale at the same time as the economy decarbonizes. As Meyerowitz researched the space, he saw an opportunity to take a slightly different approach than some other companies. The Clairity direct air capture reactor in Nevada [Photo: Clairity] First, Clairity uses a different material to capture CO2 from the air. “It’s in the same family as baking soda,” Meyerowitz says. “The materials are produced in millions of tons per year for a range of applications.” It’s abundant, cheap, and after it’s filled with CO2, it takes relatively little energy to remove it. Unlike some other chemicals used for direct air capture, it doesn’t degrade, so it can also be used longer. The plants are cheap enough to build that they don’t have to run continuously to make economic sense. That means that it’s also possible to run on cheap, intermittent solar power from the grid. (The caveat: The company will be competing with data centers that also want to run on renewable energy and may be willing to pay more.) Sorbent cartridge being inserted into adsorption station [Photo: Clairity] While many companies in the space plan to inject CO2 into underground wells, that system isn’t ready yet in the U.S. Clairity is starting with another direction: adding the CO2 to materials. For example, if it’s combined with fly ash—a byproduct from coal power plants—it can be used to make lower-carbon concrete. It won’t be the first direct air capture company to use CO2 in concrete: A startup called Heirloom previously partnered with a cement company. But Clairity is unique in that it handles both steps itself. The CO2 can also be injected into other waste materials to permanently store it. Building an underground storage well costs millions of dollars, and the process of getting regulatory approval is slow; building the company’s “ex-situ” mineralization equipment costs less than $70,000. It’s at a much smaller scale, but it allows the company to begin storage now. “We can actually deliver credits today and not from some future project,” Meyerowitz says. There’s also the potential to make more money by selling value-added products rather than only selling credits for storage. The company expects to be one of two facilities in the world to deliver certified credits for carbon stored this year. The other, 4,000-plus miles away in Iceland, is Climeworks, which partners with a company called CarbFix to inject its captured CO2 into Iceland’s deep rock formations and naturally turn the CO2 into stone. Clairity chose Vegas as its first location for a few reasons. First, the particular sorbent it uses to capture the CO2 works best in an arid climate (some others, like Climeworks’s, are better in humid climates). Nevada has abundant access to renewable power. The state has relatively little arable land, so there are more potential locations; the company plans to expand in Nevada and other parts of the Southwest. And because the company’s process generates clean water on the side, there’s also a potential market to sell that water to local utilities. (The water is produced when the company heats up its sorbent to release the captured CO2; water comes out at the same time and is separately stored.) “You can imagine that in water-stressed Las Vegas, that’s a really interesting side benefit,” Meyerowitz says. For now, it’s operating on a tiny scale. Project Juniper can capture 100 metric tons of CO2 a year; society generated more than 40 billion tons of CO2 last year. Clairity’s cost right now is around $700 per ton of captured CO2—which will need to dramatically decline to be feasible over the long term. (Federal tax credits currently help with the cost, and may be more likely to stay in place than some other climate-related incentives because of strong Republican support.) Despite the challenges, Meyerowitz believes it’s possible for the startup to scale up to an ambitious goal: 10 megatons of CO2 removal in the next decade, or 100,000 times more than its first project.",

On the other hand, Twitch expanded its moderator tools last month. The growing contrast between different creator platforms’ approaches to moderation has made some creators in marginalized groups, such as women, queer creators and creators of color, view Twitch as a digital safe haven. Creator Joseph “Halfmoonjoe” Birdsong, who identifies as gay and said he has a mostly female and queer audience, focuses most of his time on Twitch, and has deleted his accounts on other platforms such as X, which he left due to its reduced focus on moderation. Four creators told Digiday that they feel Twitch’s focus on moderation has made it the most welcoming platform for content creators of marginalized identities currently. “I feel safer on Twitch than I do on other platforms,” Birdsong said.

        "description": "A truck carrying goods for Amazon allegedly failed to slow down for an I-35 work zone in Texas, investigators said, leading to a deadly collision. The post Trucker charged in 17-car collision in Texas that killed 5 appeared first on FreightWaves. One man has been arrested as authorities continue to investigate the cause of a crash that killed five people Thursday on Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas. Authorities said 17 vehicles were involved, including a tractor-trailer hauling goods for Amazon, in the accident that happened around 11:30 p.m. in the southbound lanes of I-35. Five people were pronounced dead on the scene, including a child and an infant. Eleven others were taken to hospitals. Solomun Weldekeal Araya, 37, the Dallas-based driver of the tractor-trailer, was arrested Friday by the Austin Police Department and charged with five counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault. Preliminary information shows the truck carrying the Amazon haul failed to slow for traffic that had backed up in a temporary work zone for an I-35 expansion project, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said. “The truck that initiated the crash sequence was registered to a for-hire carrier, ZBN Transport LLC, out of Dallas, Texas,” Kenny Bragg, an NTSB investigator, said during a news conference on Sunday. “In the coming days, the team will continue to document this temporary work zone, conduct a detailed mechanical inspection of the striking truck and collect further information from witnesses. We will also be looking into the truck driver’s employment history as a commercial driver, his entire driving history to include crash history and traffic violations, as well as his medical history for factors that may have influenced his driving.” Officials for ZBN Transport LLC did not return a message seeking comment from FreightWaves on Monday. ZBN Transport told KXAN that Araya had been with their company for four months and passed background checks. Amazon officials confirmed that ZBN Transport was contracting a load for the e-commerce company.“This is a horrible tragedy, and our thoughts are with all those involved. We’re looking into this further and will cooperate with all investigations,” Amazon spokeswoman Maureen Lynch Vogel told the Austin American-Statesman.

        "description": "Amazon; DeepSeek; Getty Images; Ava Horton/BIAmazon quickly integrated DeepSeek AI models into Bedrock due to high demand in January.Amazon wants to promote its products as faster and more secure alternatives to DeepSeek.The cloud giant warns employees not to share confidential information with DeepSeek.In late January, as DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech industry, Amazon saw a huge spike in companies requesting access to the Chinese AI model on its development tool Bedrock.Amazon swiftly added DeepSeek to Bedrock. Some employees who spoke to Business Insider felt the approval process was unusually fast. Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy later told investors the company moved quickly to meet customer demand.DeepSeek's sudden rise has spurred swift reactions inside Amazon. The repercussions have been felt across product updates, sales pitches, and development efforts, according to internal documents seen by BI and people familiar with the matter.The responses show how fast-moving AI discoveries can whipsaw even the biggest and smartest technology companies. Amazon rivals, including OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have also been forced to respond to the DeepSeek impact.An Amazon spokesperson said the company's strategy has always focused on providing secure access to the latest models through AWS, giving customers control over their data to customize and build generative AI applications.\"Delivering DeepSeek models is an example of that,\" the spokesperson added in a statement to BI. \"We're extremely pleased with the feedback that we've received from the thousands of customers who have already deployed DeepSeek on AWS.\"'Privacy concerns'DeepSeek's AI models upended the tech world in January with their powerful performance and low cost. Tech stocks plunged as investors questioned US tech companies' massive spending on computing products.For now, Amazon continues to add DeepSeek-related features. Earlier this week, the cloud giant made it easier to use DeepSeek's reasoning model on Bedrock, offering a \"fully managed\" service with built-in security and monitoring features. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman wrote on LinkedIn that there's been \"incredible demand\" for DeepSeek.AWS CEO Matt GarmanNoah Berger/Noah BergerIt's not just the Bedrock team scurrying to make changes. One person said that DeepSeek has sparked many new discussions across Amazon.One particular topic has been how Amazon should position itself against DeepSeek.AWS has encouraged employees to highlight privacy and security concerns around DeepSeek when they speak to customers, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. They should remind customers of the importance of \"model choice\" and pitch AWS's Nova AI models as an alternative, the document added.The guidelines also suggest promoting Bedrock, which AWS says provides a more secure and private method of accessing AI models. With Bedrock, customer data is not shared with model providers or used to improve base models. Amazon expects most customers to use open-source versions of DeepSeek models, not those directly offered by the Chinese company, it added.\"DeepSeek's privacy policy states they collect user data and may store them on servers in China,\" the guidelines said. \"We are aware of the privacy concerns on DeepSeek models.\"Nova is faster and saferAWS has also told employees to leverage DeepSeek's shortcomings when selling Nova.The guidelines say Nova models are faster than DeepSeek's models, based on third-party benchmark data, and more secure given AWS's more robust \"responsible AI\" standards.Nova is more comparable to DeepSeek's V3 model than the R1 reasoning model and they serve different needs, the guideline also stated. However, the V3 is a \"text-only model,\" while Nova supports image and video understanding, the document emphasized.AWS is now working on its own reasoning model that would directly compete with DeepSeek's R1, BI previously reported. While AWS has been developing the new model for months, DeepSeek's recent emergence added more pressure to expedite its progress, one of the people familiar with the matter said.Efforts to study DeepSeek's technology are in the works at Amazon, and AWS wants to apply some of the training techniques DeepSeek used in its new reasoning model, some of the people added.Amazon CEO Andy JassyNoah Berger/Noah BergerDuring last month's earnings call, Jassy said Amazon was \"impressed\" with a lot of DeepSeek's training methodologies. Those include \"flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training\" and some of its \"inference optimizations,\" Jassy explained.\"For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things and we're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us,\" he said.'Deepseek-interest' channelOn the day DeepSeek roiled the stock market in late January, Amazon employees created an internal Slack channel called \"Deepseek-interest,\" according to a screenshot seen by BI. More than 1,300 employees joined the channel in just a few days.One person wrote on this Slack channel that he was \"surprised\" there wasn't much pushback against DeepSeek given its China origin and \"security concerns.\" Another person asked for Neuron, AWS's in-house chip development platform, to support DeepSeek models. A third person wrote about a customer complaint over errors they saw while using DeepSeek on Bedrock.Amazon also held an internal DeepSeek learning session in late January, according to one of the Slack messages. The event covered AWS's messaging, positioning, and key differentiators versus DeepSeek.Moving on from DeepSeekMeanwhile, Amazon now discourages employees from using DeepSeek on their work computers, according to several people familiar with the matter. Staff now get a warning to not share confidential information with DeepSeek's app, the same message they see when using ChatGPT at work.Perhaps in a sign of how fast things change in AI, some Amazon employees already seem to be moving on from DeepSeek to other Chinese AI offerings.One person wrote in the internal Slack channel that AWS should start considering other China-based models, like Alibaba's Qwen.\"DeepSeek is already the past day,\" this person wrote. \"When do we have Qwen2.5-Max?\"Have a tip?

Use a personal email address and a nonwork device; here's our guide to sharing information securely.Read the original article on Business Insider Amazon; DeepSeek; Getty Images; Ava Horton/BIAmazon quickly integrated DeepSeek AI models into Bedrock due to high demand in January.Amazon wants to promote its products as faster and more secure alternatives to DeepSeek.The cloud giant warns employees not to share confidential information with DeepSeek.In late January, as DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech industry, Amazon saw a huge spike in companies requesting access to the Chinese AI model on its development tool Bedrock.Amazon swiftly added DeepSeek to Bedrock. Some employees who spoke to Business Insider felt the approval process was unusually fast. Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy later told investors the company moved quickly to meet customer demand.DeepSeek's sudden rise has spurred swift reactions inside Amazon. The repercussions have been felt across product updates, sales pitches, and development efforts, according to internal documents seen by BI and people familiar with the matter.The responses show how fast-moving AI discoveries can whipsaw even the biggest and smartest technology companies. Amazon rivals, including OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have also been forced to respond to the DeepSeek impact.An Amazon spokesperson said the company's strategy has always focused on providing secure access to the latest models through AWS, giving customers control over their data to customize and build generative AI applications.\"Delivering DeepSeek models is an example of that,\" the spokesperson added in a statement to BI. \"We're extremely pleased with the feedback that we've received from the thousands of customers who have already deployed DeepSeek on AWS.\"'Privacy concerns'DeepSeek's AI models upended the tech world in January with their powerful performance and low cost. Tech stocks plunged as investors questioned US tech companies' massive spending on computing products.For now, Amazon continues to add DeepSeek-related features. Earlier this week, the cloud giant made it easier to use DeepSeek's reasoning model on Bedrock, offering a \"fully managed\" service with built-in security and monitoring features. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman wrote on LinkedIn that there's been \"incredible demand\" for DeepSeek.AWS CEO Matt GarmanNoah Berger/Noah BergerIt's not just the Bedrock team scurrying to make changes. One person said that DeepSeek has sparked many new discussions across Amazon.One particular topic has been how Amazon should position itself against DeepSeek.AWS has encouraged employees to highlight privacy and security concerns around DeepSeek when they speak to customers, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. They should remind customers of the importance of \"model choice\" and pitch AWS's Nova AI models as an alternative, the document added.The guidelines also suggest promoting Bedrock, which AWS says provides a more secure and private method of accessing AI models. With Bedrock, customer data is not shared with model providers or used to improve base models. Amazon expects most customers to use open-source versions of DeepSeek models, not those directly offered by the Chinese company, it added.\"DeepSeek's privacy policy states they collect user data and may store them on servers in China,\" the guidelines said. \"We are aware of the privacy concerns on DeepSeek models.\"Nova is faster and saferAWS has also told employees to leverage DeepSeek's shortcomings when selling Nova.The",

        "description": "Target's ad business continues to grow, but can it compete with retail media network titans Walmart and Amazon? By the looks of Target’s latest earnings call, its ad business continues to be a bright spot for the retailer. Last year, Target’s ad business raked in $649 million in revenue, up 25% from the $522 million it pulled in the year prior. But for all its growth, Target is the David to the Goliaths of Walmart and Amazon, whose ad businesses brought in $4.4 billion and $50 billion in 2024, respectively. But even if Target is a long shot from hitting the bullseye to become a retail media power player, buyers see potential thanks to the retailer’s new self-service and second-price auction ad offerings. For the first few months of 2025, Target has been caught in a media frenzy due to its moves involving diversity, equity and inclusion policies and subsequent boycotting, on top of missing its revenue expectations last November. Media buyers and commerce executives say they don’t expect to put a dent in the retailer’s audience data, making it unlikely to impact its ad business — at least for now.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson have spent decades of their lives with Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's Wheel of Time books, and they previously brought that knowledge to bear as they recapped each first season episode and second season episode of Amazon's WoT TV series. Now we're back in the saddle for season three—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory. These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out. If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you.

        "description": "Stream your DRM-free audiobooks to devices yourselves, without the cloud's chains. We’re an audiobook family at House Hutchinson, and at any given moment my wife or I are probably listening to one while puttering around. We've collected a bit over 300 of the things—mostly titles from web sources (including Amazon's Audible) and from older physical \"books on tape\" (most of which are actually on CDs). I don't mind doing the extra legwork of getting everything into files and then dragging-n-dropping those files into the Books app on my Mac, but my wife prefers to simply use Audible's app to play things directly—it's (sometimes) quick, it's (generally) easy, and it (occasionally) works. But a while back, the Audible app stopped working for her. Tapping the app's \"Library\" button would just show a spinning loading icon, forever. All the usual troubleshooting (logging in and out in various ways, removing and reinstalling the app, other familiar rituals) yielded no results; some searching around on Google and DuckDuckGo led me to nothing except a lot of other people having the same problem and a whole lot of silence from Audible and Amazon. So, having put in the effort to do things the \"right\" way and having that way fail, I changed tacks and fixed the problem, permanently, with Audiobookshelf.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Amazon's five-day RTO mandate began on January 2.4x6/Getty, Ava Horton/BIDemoralized, stressed out, and struggling to take care of family members. Energized, efficient, and connected to their coworkers.These are some of the feelings Amazon employees described in interviews with Business Insider as they adjust to its five-day return-to-office mandate.We contacted dozens of employees to understand how the mandate was going 10 weeks into its rollout. Though most declined to speak, 11 people — including some who reached out on their own and two who were supplied by Amazon — gave us a detailed look at how RTO has affected their lives.These are the experiences of those employees — including two who quit their jobs over the RTO mandate — told in their own words. Some requested anonymity citing fear of retaliation, and BI verified their employment. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.'My job isn't as good as it was two months ago.'John Guballa was irritated when he found out about Amazon's 5-day RTO policy.John GuballaJohn Guballa, 40, is based in Seattle. He worked at Amazon from 2011 to 2016 before rejoining the company in March 2024 as a senior risk manager.When I came back to Amazon, I understood that I'd work three days a week in the office and could pick which days. My preference was to be entirely remote, but I took the job because I felt wanted by the hiring manager.I was irritated when I found out about five-day RTO — it feels like they're changing the rules.Andy Jassy's statements on RTO have been around culture and collaboration, but I don't work closely with people in the same city as me. While I enjoy seeing some people at the office, we're not getting any value in terms of collaboration.Someone near me in the office posted a sign for \"quiet hours\" every day from 1 to 4 p.m. My impression is that they might feel that having people around is actually impairing them from doing what they need to do.John Guballa saw this sign taped up at his Amazon office.Photo courtesy of John Guballa.Over the last several years, I've adapted and feel confident in my relationship-building with folks in a virtual environment. Collaboration wasn't a problem, or at least not one that RTO would resolve. If you want people to get to know each other, I don't think the method is dropping a cooler full of beers and saying, \"Hey, socialize.\" It would be better if leadership organized intentional team-building activities, but I haven't seen that.I've got two kids — a fourth grader and a kindergartner. They've got activities and doctor's appointments, and somebody's got to pick them up from the bus. I find myself having to push more of that toward my spouse, who works from home. We're very blessed and fortunate to be two parents raising kids together and can manage it, but it's adding a strain and inconvenience that I didn't expect when I joined the company.Five-day RTO has impacted how I think about my future at Amazon. The simple fact is that the expectations have changed, and my job isn't as good as it was two months ago.'I've made connections you just can't make virtually.'Grace Cleveland commutes about an hour to her Amazon office in Boston.Grace ClevelandGrace Cleveland, 37, is based in Boston and joined Amazon in 2017, focusing on privacy and data handling within Alexa. Today, she leads global AI and privacy compliance in the workplace. In a written interview, she shared her experience with RTO5.My commute is around one hour door-to-door. Amazon increased our monthly public transportation subsidy and has partnered with local restaurants to provide on-site lunch options.In January, I traveled between four different offices — Berlin, Paris, New York, and Boston — and ran into people I didn't know were in those offices, as they had transferred during the pandemic. These are connections you just can't make virtually.The days feel a bit longer, but I'm reading more books during my commute. My husband and I have had to make more proactive decisions about how we handle certain situations with our two young kids, ages 3 and 4. With hybrid work three days a week, I had more flexibility to be a present parent AND a good employee; being in the office full-time, I sometimes have to prioritize being a present parent OR a good employee.In my opinion, the main benefit of RTO relates to Andy Jassy's shareholder letter on building \"primitives\" — which in tech means that you're building in blocks that can be shared and reused between teams. If we're all virtual, it's harder to know what other teams are doing. With RTO, I've been in conversations where we realized that we're working on a similar solution, preventing duplicate work and connecting our teams to work toward a common path, which is better for everyone.'I'd thought Amazon could be a company I stayed at forever.'Jason Murray quit his Amazon job in January 2025.Jason MurrayJason Murray, 31, was a senior art director at Amazon based in New York. He spent three years at the company before leaving in January. His office's RTO5 plans were delayed until May 2025, but the mandate played a role in his decision to leave.I moved to New York from Atlanta for this job. My wife and I had always wanted to try living in New York, and I thought I'd found the perfect blend of having a really creative job and work-life balance. I thought Amazon could be a company I stayed at forever.I'm very introverted and have hyperhidrosis, which means I have the sweatiest hands on the planet, so any social interaction involving handshakes would make me very anxious. I'm a lot more productive at home, where I'm not being interrupted by spontaneous social interactions. I prefer to process and really dig into a problem first, and then send a note or swing by someone's desk once I have a plan of action.When three-day RTO was announced, it felt like the vision I had for my long-term future was dying. I knew that wasn't my optimum lifestyle. My wife would text me pictures of our son, and I felt like I was missing so much.I quit at the end of January to pursue freelance work. Since leaving, I'm still trying to find my rhythm with a more flexible schedule, and I've been rearranging my work to spend more time with my family. I love working from home and don't regret leaving Amazon.I get what some companies and their leadership might be thinking with RTO, but they're ignoring their top talent. Not everyone performs and works their best in the office, and they're going to lose their top-tier people.'RTO5 made me interested in applying to work at Amazon again.'This employee in his 30s previously worked at Amazon, left for personal reasons, and returned last year. The five-day RTO announcement was a factor that influenced him to apply to rejoin Amazon, and he relocated to a major West Coast hub for the job.When I heard about RTO5, I was curious and cautiously optimistic. It made me interested in applying to Amazon again.When I was previously at Amazon, it was really difficult to get the attention of my coworkers and managers via Slack and Zoom. It's really hard to connect with people when you can't see them.I was still pretty early in my career and had heard other former Amazon employees talk about the best part of the job being mentorship, coaching, and connections — I felt like I wasn't getting that.For me, RTO has been great. I've been able to form relationships with my teammates and with my manager, and I feel like I'm having a lot more visibility on issues that affect me. I've gotten to meet important people, and I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to mentor others and help them level up in their careers.It's been pretty flexible; they do want me there five days a week, but if I have a paper to write or if I'm studying for certifications, I've been able to do that at home or at study locations at some of the offices.What makes Amazon so great is that they're willing to be misunderstood. If they understand that something is going to be valuable, they're going to do it, even if it's unpopular. I'm cautiously optimistic that RTO5 will inspire positive change in terms of collaboration and leadership principles, but I think people are still adjusting.'This is no longer the company I signed up for.'This employee in her 30s has been with the company for over 10 years and is based in the US. She worked remotely for several years prior to the RTO mandate. After the RTO3 mandate, she received an accommodation approval to work from home due to a disability affecting stress regulation.Prior to these last two years, I didn't feel any judgment from my team or the pressure to explain why I wasn't in the office. I shouldn't have to explain that I have an invisible disability so that I have the same respect I had three or four years ago, before RTO mandates were a thing. Getting on a video call where everyone else except me is in the office makes me feel the need to divulge very personal information to my peers.When my accommodation was approved, I thought it would mean that the company would have to honor what my body needs to function and for me to contribute at my best. But instead, I've felt that I'm viewed as offering no value if I can't be physically present. That's not the Amazon that I've known and loved for so long.I used to have a very clear, specific path in mind: stay at Amazon for no more than five years, with long-term aspirations of writing, speaking, and further academic pursuits. But I loved it so much that I've stayed for five more years. I've grown up here; it changed my life positively in so many ways.But this is no longer the company I signed up for. There's no recognition that one way of doing things doesn't work for everybody, and the people who are most negatively impacted are going to be women, minorities, and other historically excluded populations.'There's a benefit to being in-person as a new hire, but sometimes it feels unnecessary.'This employee in his early 20s was hire",

Mark your calendar for earnings reports. For Amazon it’s April 29. For Walmart it’s May 15. If you have any stake or interest in the fortunes of the American consumer, those dates will be ones to watch, because as the first quarter draws to a close, Amazon and Walmart are bracing for what could be a challenging earnings season. Both companies, bellwethers of consumer spending, have expressed caution about their Q1 prospects due to persistent inflation, weak consumer demand and foreign exchange challenges. This cautious outlook reflects broader concerns about the health of the global economy and its impact on consumer behavior. They are, of course, not alone in the attention those earnings will receive. Other companies will step up with their own take on consumer spending, but it is expected to be down, maybe even significantly. According to The Wall Street Journal, “Citi’s analysis of its U.S. credit-card data shows that spending has fallen across most retail categories. In the retail quarter to date, spending plunged 12% and 22% on apparel and athletic footwear, respectively, compared with a year earlier. But even less-discretionary categories such as food retail, aftermarket auto parts and pet retail are seeing moderate declines.” In recent months, consumers have been prioritizing essential purchases over discretionary items, a trend exacerbated by high inflation. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted this shift during a March 10 speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, stating, “There are lots of income levels in this country — if you’re at the lower end of that scale, you are feeling more frustration and pain because of higher food prices. They’ve persisted for years now, and you’re just tired of it.” McMillon also highlighted that budget-conscious consumers are buying smaller pack sizes and being more selective with their purchases. But there are other issues. According to a March 7 article from Zachs, “Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company’s implied fourth-quarter view [Q1 by the calendar] for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.” Similarly, Amazon has faced challenges in maintaining its sales momentum. The company’s projected revenue for Q1 2025 was below expectations, ranging from $151 billion to $155.5 billion, reflecting concerns about inflation and consumer spending. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, observed, “Uncertainty seems to be the buzzword of earnings calls. … Going into this year, a lot of retailers are very nervous about various aspects of policy, particularly tariffs. They fear both the cost implications for their businesses and the dampening impact higher prices would have on spending.” Impact of Tariffs and Inflation Tariffs have been another significant factor affecting both retailers. Walmart, as the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, is particularly vulnerable to tariffs on discretionary items like clothing and electronics, which are primarily sourced from countries such as China and India. Brian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, noted that more than 70% of Walmart’s Great Value brand products come from China, making the company sensitive to tariff fluctuations. Inflation continues to pressure consumer budgets, leading to a focus on value-driven purchases. Jeanel Alvarado, founder and CEO of RetailBoss, explained, “Consumers feel the pinch of inflation, shifting their focus to essentials like groceries and health products while cutting back on discretionary items like apparel and electronics.” Despite these challenges, both companies have shown resilience. Amazon recently surpassed Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time, with $187.8 billion in sales compared to Walmart’s $180.5 billion. However, Walmart’s annual sales still outpace Amazon’s, with projections indicating Walmart will generate approximately $708.7 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, while Amazon is expected to reach about $700.8 billion. Walmart’s stock has faced volatility following its mixed Q4 earnings report, with shares dropping after the company provided softer-than-expected guidance for Q1 2025 and beyond. Despite this, Walmart’s business fundamentals remain strong, with eCommerce sales surging and the company attracting higher-income shoppers. As Amazon and Walmart prepare to report their Q1 2025 earnings, the retail landscape is marked by caution. Consumer spending trends suggest a continued focus on essentials and value-driven purchases, influenced by inflation and tariff concerns. While both companies face challenges, their adaptability and strategic shifts in response to consumer behavior will be crucial in navigating these headwinds. As Saunders noted, “There is genuine concern that demand could soften in a material way,” underscoring the need for retailers to remain agile in an uncertain economic environment.

        "description": "A new memoir that paints Facebook’s parent company and its executives in a negative light is rising on Amazon’s Best Sellers rankings faster than you can ask a Meta AI assistant to define “Streisand effect.” Careless People, written by former Meta employee Sarah Wynn-Williams, was the No. 5 best-selling book on Amazon as of early Thursday afternoon, one day after an arbitrator ordered the author to temporarily stop promoting the book. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone applauded the emergency ruling yesterday on Threads, saying it affirmed that the “false and defamatory book should never have been published.” However, the legal fight appears to have drawn increased attention to Careless People, which was ranked around No. 81 shortly after Stone’s post—meaning it rose more than 75 places since then. Amazon’s sales rankings are based on recent activity around a product and tend to fluctuate frequently, but getting into the top five in the books category on any given day is an enviable position for an author. Additionally, the book is No. 1 in three subcategories: scientist biographies, politics and social sciences, and industries. What is Careless People about? Wynn-Williams worked as the global director of public policy for Meta when it was still called Facebook. She was fired in 2017 for what Meta describes as “poor performance and toxic behavior.” Careless People details her time at the social media giant and apparently contains unflattering portrayals of CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg. One claim in the book that has been making the rounds in media circles involves Zuckerberg’s attempts to enter China, which included supposed anti-censorship tools to appease the Communist government. Meta has said these details were reported years ago. What happens next? The arbitration order essentially prevents Wynn-Williams from saying anything critical about Meta, presumably until the two sides can privately arbitrate the matter. Reached for comment by Fast Company, a Meta spokesperson continued to cast aspersions on the author and pointed to the emergency arbitration ruling as a victory. “This urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years,” the company said. However, a spokesperson for Flatiron Books, the Macmillan imprint that published Careless People, didn’t seem ready to back down. “The arbitration order has no impact on Macmillan,” Flatiron spokesperson Marlena Bittner told Fast Company. “However, we are appalled by Meta’s tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement . . . The book went through a thorough editing and vetting process, and we remain committed to publishing important books such as this. We will absolutely continue to support and promote it.”",

Previously, Kohl’s accepted Amazon returns at all locations in the U.S. except Anchorage, Alaska, per Kohl’s corporate website, which has not been updated to reflect the updated policy. It’s unclear how many locations out of Kohl’s roughly 1,100 store fleet are impacted by the policy change or how long the new policy will last.

        "description": "Twitch CEO Dan Clancy says his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences that doesn't exist elsewhere.Amy Price/Getty ImagesLive-streaming yourself for hours a day used to be a pipe dream for weirdos. Now it's pretty mainstream.Twitch gets credit for that, and that's why Amazon bought the company for $1 billion in 2014.But as of a year ago, Twitch still wasn't profitable. And it faces plenty of competitors. That's a challenge for CEO Dan Clancy.You have probably heard of Twitch, the company that basically invented live-streaming in the US, and that Amazon bought for $1 billion in 2014.Do you use Twitch? That's a different question. There are now lots of places to watch people do things live on the internet. And some streamers who really broke through on Twitch — like Kai Cenat, or Hasan Piker — spend a lot of time on rival platforms, too.No problem, says Dan Clancy. The Twitch CEO, who's been on the job for two years, says he thinks his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences — and, crucially, for audiences to connect with each other — that doesn't exist elsewhere.I had other questions for Clancy, like: When will Twitch actually make money for Amazon? And what happened to plans to port Twitch-like experiences to other places — like NBA games? And in a world where moderation is a political hotbutton, how does Twitch deal with streamers who talk for hours on end, and are often likely to say something that will upset someone?We talked about all of that in a recent chat, recorded live at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. You can hear the whole thing on my Channels podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.Business Insider: Hasan Piker, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, was recently suspended after making an extended metaphor about the healthcare system that involved killing US Sen. Rick Scott. He's been suspended multiple times. How do you get suspended at Twitch? Do you get involved when it's a high-profile person? Is this automated? How do you get reinstated?Dan Clancy: So first of all, the suspensions are not indefinite. They're there for a given period of time.Sort of a timeout.Right… to try to make sure people stay within the guardrails. If someone goes outside the guardrails a little, give them a little bit of timeout. So then [streamers know] \"OK. I'm going to work hard to stay within the community guidelines.\"We have a team that does that. It's not automated. I'll be aware of their decisions for certain high-profile [streamers]. But it's not my decision, because the whole point is to keep some degree of separation.Even before last fall's election, we were seeing tech platforms rethinking moderation and rules, and they were moving away from moderation in some cases. Elon Musk led the way on that with Twitter. Now, it seems like there's additional political pressure for platforms and media companies. How is that affecting Twitch?We were lucky in that we were not overly aggressive previously. I think sometimes, especially with misinformation and other things, people moved the line. And we had always consistently said, \"listen, you should be free to say what you want. It's how you say it. You can't be spewing hate. You can't be threatening violence…\"But you could say, \"I want to take Ivermectin to deal with my Covid.\"Correct. We did have a policy [to deal with] someone whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation, but that doesn't really happen on Twitch. We don't have the viral spreading of information. More often than not, what people say on Twitch is a manifestation of what they hear through the other platforms. So someone might say, \"Oh, I read a Facebook post the other day that said this.\"So you've always been sort of looser than some of the other platforms. And it doesn't seem like the Jim Jordans of the world are going after you and subpoenaing you and asking you to explain why you censored so-and-so. Is that because it's just a different platform? Is it because they don't know what Twitch is?No, I think it's because we have not been getting into that space. In general, we have not waded into censoring people.People talk about Twitter as a town square. Twitter's not really a town square, because it just spreads all over the place. In a town square, you're either in the town square or you're not. And on a Twitch channel, either you're watching the channel live or you're not. If someone doesn't want to watch the channel, don't watch it. It doesn't algorithmically suddenly appear in their feed. You show up, you watch a channel. If you don't want someone watching your channel, you can ban them and stop them from watching your channel.Kai Cenat became famous as a live streamer on Twitch, but you can now see him all sorts of places — like this WWE Monday Night RAW broadcast in January 2025.WWE/Getty ImagesIn the pandemic a lot of people discovered Twitch, and people spent a lot more time on Twitch. Then there was a rush from YouTube, Microsoft, Facebook to build their own version of Twitch. They offered huge contracts to some of the biggest Twitch streamers. Now they basically have all sort of retreated from that business.Their hope was, \"I'll lose money on this creator. But all these users will come.\" But when that creator left Twitch, there was another creator ready to step up and become the next big thing on Twitch. They filled that void. And so [rival platforms] said, \"No, this doesn't work. We're not really pulling [audience] from Twitch. So why do we want to keep losing money on these deals?\"So you had deep-pocketed competitors that walked away. Does that mean they concluded they could never compete? Or did they decide this business is not worth it for them and they can get a better return doing something else?It's absolutely the case that the VOD business, like TikTok and YouTube, is a great business. You watch that when you have five minutes here, five minutes there, and you add up the five minutes… it's a great business. I mean, it's bigger than our business.Their thought was \"This will be on top of our business.\" And they still all do live. It's not like they pulled back from live. They've pulled back from signing money-losing deals. And when you pull back from that artificial injection of capital, Twitch, because it focuses on live, [streamers say] \"No, I'd rather be on Twitch.\"A while back Twitch was on the radar of media companies, and people like the NBA were saying they wanted their broadcasts to look more like Twitch. They had demos where there was a basketball game going on with all Twitch stuff on the side. It doesn't look like that ever took off. Is that media companies saying, \"actually, we're not really ready for a Twitch- like experience?\" Is that the audience saying, \"We're not ready for that\"?I think it's people misunderstanding what is so special about Twitch. Let's take music. There's a ton of musicians on Twitch. And people said \"I know — we'll put music on Twitch. We're going to film a concert.\" So you take one concert and you film it. But then the creator isn't interacting with the community online. It's not distinctly different than what you can watch in a VOD, right? And it happens once. So the people are not building community among themselves.The musicians that use Twitch — they often use Twitch more to engage with their audience and community and doing whatever they do in their free time. The poster child example is T-Pain, who's a big musician who streams on Twitch all the time. I'll chat with him and hang out with him on Twitch and he games on Twitch. He does his sound recording on Twitch.The point is, it's not about taking traditional music media and sticking chat next to it. That doesn't create community. That is just traditional premium media with people chatting alongside, which they already do on Twitter.Two years ago, you became the Twitch CEO. Then you had layoffs. Then you said Twitch wasn't profitable, which is why you made the cuts. It's kind of shocking to hear that between Amazon's resources and Twitch's cultural cachet, that Twitch wasn't making money. Is it making money now?So I don't talk about where we're at now. But when you say it's shocking — it's not that shocking. Uber didn't make money till last year.Yes, but they were in a different business. And YouTube was making money — not right away, but…I was at YouTube from 2010 to 2012. For a long time, YouTube was not profitable. So I don't think it's that strange.I think this is an issue in the tech space, where there is this mindset of \"build your organization for where you're going to be in three or four years.\" That came out of Google, in part because Google was lucky enough to have a money machine in the back of the house.So everyone else — it was like grow, grow, grow. Get a big team, get a big team. And to be honest, part of what happened to Twitch, they kind of fell into that at Amazon.The Twitch team, when they first got there, they were very scrappy. And then people would come and say, \"No, no, no, that's not the game here. You have to argue for more resources.\" And having been in Big Tech, that is the game: How do you argue for more resources? As opposed to: How do you figure out what is the number you need to serve your audience in your community? And so we were just like many other folks in tech.

As Amazon ramps up its focus on artificial intelligence-powered shopping, sellers on the company’s sprawling marketplace are exploring how best to optimize their content while navigating the uncertainties that come with emerging technology. Like many other tech giants, Amazon has been pouring money into AI, ramping up its spending on the data centers, chips and real estate needed to power artificial intelligence. The technology has surged in popularity since OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022. Amazon has released an array of AI-powered tools for merchants and customers alike, including a consumer-facing chatbot assistant Rufus, which the company rolled out to all U.S. users in July, ahead of its crucial Prime Day sale.

        "description": "SXSW experiential offerings varied from immersive activations from Criterion and FX to holistic takes from Amazon and Paramount+. Brynn Brewer got in line around 9:30 a.m. last Saturday morning behind dozens of others — some of whom got there as early as 6 a.m. to be near the front of the line — for the chance to experience the Criterion closet like the filmmakers and artists featured on the entertainment company’s YouTube channel. The South by Southwest experience to Brewer, a content producer at Chubbies Shorts, felt like an “organic activation” and “more like an interactive art installment.” Brewer isn’t alone in her assessment. The three women around her in line shared similar sentiments, noting their love of classic film, while shielding themselves with an umbrella from the heat of the Austin, Texas sun. To them, the three minutes allotted to each group to enter the mobile Criterion closet truck, peruse the classic films featured in the collection, pick out a few of those films to take home on Blu-ray and talk about why they matter (as well as get a Polaroid of themselves in the closet) was worth the wait. As marketers, agency execs, filmmakers and musicians returned to Austin this past week for SXSW — which runs until March 15th — so too have the brands like Criterion, FX, Paramount, Amazon and Alaska Airlines with various experiential activations on the ground. In the past, marketers believed that having an experience was a must and brands faced irrelevancy without one. Now, after having experienced the shutdown of experiential efforts during the pandemic, marketers, agency execs and attendees believe experiential at SXSW (and elsewhere) shouldn’t solely be about relevance, but to give attendees a real way to interact with the brand.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "More consumers are voting with their wallets this year, as boycotts against Target, Amazon and more are underway. It could add to a potent concoction of challenges for brands and retailers already on thin ice. This year, more customers are taking action with their wallets as major retailers like Target and Amazon are facing multiple, simultaneous boycotts — actions that could shake up the retail outlook for the year. Boycotts as a response to retailers’ pullback of some diversity, equity and inclusion policies have made headlines in 2025. On Feb. 28, a group calling itself The People’s Union USA organized “Economic Blackout Day,” which encouraged shoppers to not spend at all, or only spend locally if they had to. Target is now facing a 40-day strike, or “Target Fast,” as a way to protest the retailer ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Running concurrently with the Lent period, that boycott has been organized by the Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, and other faith and civil rights leaders, per the Associated Press. Additionally, roughly 9% of shoppers said they planned to participate in The People’s Union USA’s weeklong Amazon boycott this week, per a Numerator survey. The organization is also planning a Nestlé boycott from March 21-28, a Walmart boycott from April 7-14 and another one-day blackout on April 18.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says staffing cuts could delay its case against Amazon. As CNBC reported Wednesday (March 12), attorneys for the regulator have asked a judge to hold off on the start of a trial into whether Amazon had tricked customers into signing up for the company’s Prime program. The reason? Staging and budget shortfalls, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, told Judge John Chun during a status hearing in federal court in Seattle ahead of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin Sept. 22. “We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team,” Cohen said, asking the judge for a two-month continuance. As the CNBC report noted, the agency’s request is happening as the White House’s new Department of Government Efficiency is pushing to reduce spending, an effort that has included layoffs of tens of thousands of federal employees. The judge asked Cohen how the FTC’s situation “will be different in two months” if the regulator is “in crisis now, as far as resources.” Cohen replied by saying that he “cannot guarantee if things won’t be even worse.” He even said it’s possible that the FTC may have to move to another office “unexpectedly,” which could hinder its ability to prepare for the trial. “But there’s a lot of reason to believe … we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while,” Cohen said. As PYMNTS reported last month, the FTC has of late made moves that suggest that the business world’s hopes that the Trump administration would take a more relaxed approach to regulation may be unfounded. For example, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said last month the agency would continue to use the merger guidelines established by the commission and Department of Justice in 2023. The same day, Ferguson named David Shaw as the FTC’s principal deputy director, describing him as “an experienced antitrust lawyer with expertise in high-stakes litigation and contentious merger review.” The FTC sued Amazon in June of 2023, alleging that the tech giant had employed practices that “tricked and trapped” customers into signing up for Prime recurring subscriptions. The suit argued that Amazon has used “dark patterns” to dupe consumers into enrolling into the program, while also making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. The regulator also alleged that while Amazon had revamped its cancellation process for at least some subscribers, “the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.” Amazon has said the FTC’s case has no merit, and — per the CNBC report — also opposed the agency’s request to delay the trial.

The Federal Trade Commission is moving to push back a trial set to determine if Amazon tricked customers into signing up for Prime subscriptions. At a Zoom status hearing on Wednesday, the FTC officially asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial. According to the FTC's attorney, Jonathan Cohen, the agency needs two months to prepare beyond the September 22 start date, blaming recent \"staffing and budgetary shortfalls\" stemming from the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), CNBC reported. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team,\" Cohen said, explaining that \"there is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel,\" Bloomberg reported. Cuts are apparently so bad, Cohen told Chun that the FTC is stuck with a $1 cap on any government credit card charges and \"may not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday’s hearing,\" Bloomberg reported.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "After Amazon bid failure, firm cut 50% of staff and is launching new robots. Robotics firm iRobot, originator of the robotic vacuum Roomba facing stiff competition from lower-priced competitors, told investors Tuesday that there was \"substantial doubt\" about the company's survival \"as a going concern\" in the next year or so. Investors took iRobot at its word, and its stock price had fallen nearly 40 percent as of 10:20 am Wednesday from the day before. The dire accounting language and market reaction are nothing new for tech firms, but iRobot's annual report suggests deeper issues than investor confidence. The company saw revenue drop 47 percent in the fourth quarter, it is actively seeking to renegotiate its largest loans, and it has launched a \"formal strategic review\" to consider refinancing, sale, or other alternatives. The shaky world of consumer robotics iRobot's fortunes have changed dramatically since 2022, when Amazon announced a $1.7 billion bid to buy the struggling but prominent firm.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "President Donald TrumpWin McNamee/Pool Photo via APTech companies seek to hire thousands of skilled foreign workers through H-1B visas each year.President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is raising questions about the future of such visas.See which tech companies file for the most H-1B visas, according to publicly available data.Tech industry giants are hiring thousands of foreign workers through H-1B visas each year, even as the program faces renewed scrutiny under President Donald Trump's second term and growing skepticism from Silicon Valley leaders who once championed it.The H-1B program allows US companies to hire up to 85,000 foreign workers with specialized skills annually. Workers are chosen through an annual lottery, which kicked off last week and will run through March 24. While Trump expressed support in December, calling it \"a great program\" that he has \"used many times,\" key figures in his political base have voiced opposition.Things escalated late last year when Trump appointed Sriram Krishnan, a first-generation Indian American who immigrated to the US from India in 2007, to serve as a senior White House advisor for AI. The appointment drew backlash from some MAGA supporters, including former Trump aide Steve Bannon, who called the program \"a total and complete scam to destroy the American worker.\"In late January, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Rick Scott introduced a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act to reverse a Biden-era rule that extended the automatic renewal period for employment authorization documents from 180 days to 540 days. Kennedy said the extension \"hampers the Trump administration's efforts to enforce our immigration laws,\" signaling there would be additional scrutiny of work permits for foreign nationals.Even tech leaders have softened their stance. Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, once unequivocal supporters, have recently acknowledged the need for improvement.Andreessen said on Lex Fridman's podcast last month that the US has been conducting \"a 60-year social engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into.\"Musk has called for raising the minimum salary requirements for people on H-1B visas and adding a \"yearly cost\" to make it more expensive for companies to hire from overseas. \"I've been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,\" he posted on X.While the program's future remains uncertain, any significant changes or restrictions to H-1B visas would profoundly impact America's largest technology companies, which have built their workforces around access to global talent.Business Insider used publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services to analyze which tech companies filed the most H-1B requests during the 2024 government fiscal year. The data comes from applications submitted by businesses seeking to sponsor skilled workers' visas.Our analysis shows that tech giants collectively file for thousands of these visas annually, using them to fill critical roles that they claim cannot be adequately staffed domestically.Notably, not every visa filing results in an actual hire, and occasionally multiple filings might be associated with a single position. Companies sometimes submit new applications to accommodate amendments or extend existing visas. Nevertheless, the data available to the public offers a reliable glimpse into the H-1B visa requirements of major corporations.We have excluded IT consulting firms from this analysis to focus specifically on tech product companies, despite consulting giants like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services traditionally being among the program's largest users.The analysis reveals that tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Apple are among the program's heaviest users, with thousands of filings each.While most positions are for software engineers and other technical roles, companies also use the program to fill specialized positions in research, product management, and data science. The employee head count for each firm comes from the latest publicly available data such as the company's latest annual report, their corporate website, or according to sources BI spoke with.The firms listed either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record.Here are the top 40 tech companies sponsoring H-1B visas, ranked by their number of filings:1.

Wilson, marks the end of an era and raises questions about the franchise's future.With no actor signed on yet to play Bond — 2021's \"No Time to Die\" marked the final installment for the most recent 007, Daniel Craig — Amazon has a chance to reboot the franchise and take it in any direction it chooses. But will it take a risk on casting an unconventional 007, focus on spinoffs, or play it safe? John Cork, a filmmaker and author who has produced, written, and directed more than 30 documentaries for MGM's James Bond releases, shared his insight with Business Insider, offering up some ideas for what Bezos and Amazon can do to continue the legacy of one of film's most iconic characters.Broccoli and Wilson's influence on Bond goes back decades, giving them the instant credibility Amazon lacksBarbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.Tim P Whitby/GettyA full reboot of the franchise hasn't been on the table since the early 1990s, when Broccoli and Wilson stepped in, casting Pierce Brosnan as the new Bond and releasing \"GoldenEye\" in 1995. The movie went on to became a box office sensation, proving that Bond was still relevant in the post-Cold War era.As the daughter and stepson of producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who originated the Bond franchise, half-siblings Broccoli and Wilson had deep ties the legacy of 007. Wilson had written the previous five Bond movies before producing \"GoldenEye\" and came up with the thrilling opening sequences for 1977's \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" and 1979's \"Moonraker.\" Broccoli was the franchise's \"beating heart,\" as Cork put it; she'd cement her own legacy decades later when she cast Daniel Craig.\"The history of commercial businesses is littered with ventures that have failed because the children of moguls have attempted to fill their parents' shoes,\" Cork told BI. \"Barbara and Michael did it with spectacular success and grace.\"Like Dave Filoni with \"Star Wars\" and Kevin Feige with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Broccoli and Wilson were the gatekeepers of Bond who didn't just know its history chapter and verse but had a proven track record of pulling off the gargantuan task of producing a Bond movie for the big screen.With Amazon soon at the helm, they'll have to get acquainted with the franchise's long and storied history and deep fan base — fast.\"You have an audience drumming its fingers going, 'Okay Amazon, prove to me you know how to not screw this up,'\" Cork said.Casting the right James Bond will be Amazon's biggest testDaniel Craig, Sean Connery, and Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.MGM.Beyond creating stories filled with thrilling action set in breathtaking locales, the best way for Amazon to silence the doubters is to choose the right James Bond.\"Audiences are very forgiving to a wide variety of interpretations, but every line and every movement needs to feel like something that James Bond would do,\" Cork said.Nailing the Bond casting — not focusing on any potential spinoffs — should be the name of the game, Cork added.\"It's very hard to do a James Bond movie or series without James Bond,\" he said of potential spinoffs in the Bond universe. \"The thing that differentiates a James Bond film from every other film out there is the character of James Bond.\"But who should play Bond, and is it time to cast someone other than a white British man? \"I don't know, because I haven't seen it tried the other way,\" Cork said. \"All I can say is if I was spending the kind of money that Amazon has spent to gain control of James Bond, do I wish to take the riskiest path and risk the value of the entire franchise off of making a deeply unconventional casting choice?\"Whatever Amazon ultimately decides, Cork said he'll be first in line to see what adventures 007 takes on next.\"There are things that go on here that are invisible to anyone just watching the finished product,\" he said. \"But there are many paths to paradise.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Daniel Craig has been the last actor to play James Bond.Eon ProductionsAmazon is taking control of the James Bond franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

        "description": "The eight founders of Critical Role started streaming on Twitch in 2015. Now they're rolling out their 10th anniversary road map.Heirlume PhotographyThe nerdworld business Critical Role celebrates its 10th anniversary on March 12.They started off playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" on Twitch, but have built a sprawling business from it.CR's cofounders tell BI that in 2025, they're expanding on five fronts.On March 12, Critical Role celebrates its 10th anniversary — a capstone for its rise to nerdworld business supremacy.Now, four cofounders — Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham — told Business Insider their crew is ready to roll out its road map for 2025 and beyond.The business' eight cofounders have come a long way from a group of nerds streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. In 2022, CR raised seed funding of more than $11.3 million to create an animated series — a project that's turned into not one, but two Amazon-backed animated series' on Prime Video.The CR business has multiple segments, including Darrington Press, its game publishing arm; Metapigeon, its production wing; and the Critical Role Foundation, its charity initiative. And CR and its peers are now selling out arenas and hitting the road for global tours.\"We have been planning and planting and nurturing the earth for so long — I think we're just looking forward to watching the garden grow,\" O'Brien said.In 2025, the team is expanding in five areas.1. A Critical Role video gameWillingham, CR's CEO, said that the crew is \"hard at work\" on a video game — a new area for CR. He won't tell BI the name yet, but plans to announce it \"any day.\"For now, he's calling this gaming venture the \"interactive slate.\" He says it'll expand on Exandria, the gaming world that Matthew Mercer, the crew's longtime game master and chief creative officer, created over a decade ago.\"They'll actually be getting their hand on the stick and controlling the outcome of the story, changing what might be possible from not just some of their favorite characters, but new offerings in the world of Exandria,\" Willingham said.2. Back to streaming and more live showsCritical Role wrapped its third long-running campaign in February.Critical RoleThe company's 10th anniversary dovetails with the February finale of the third \"Critical Role\" campaign.But the cofounders will be back on stream soon. In the interim, Ray says Riegel will take over Mercer's seat as game master for a new program.CR is also hitting multiple cities in the US and two arenas in Australia for live shows this year. Riegel told BI the crew is now scouting some dream locations — and they'd love to play in venues in Canada, Europe, and South America.Lauding CR's peers at \"Dimension 20\" — who just performed in front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden — Ray said what they do isn't niche anymore.\"It honestly doesn't make sense that 'D&D' shows are selling out arenas that Taylor Swift has played,\" Ray said. \"This medium has grown, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\"The company plans to announce its 2026 live show slate in the spring, Ray said.3. Daggerheart's official releaseThe Critical Role cast in 2024 used their Twitch stream to promote a beta version of \"Daggerheart,\" the tabletop game their company made.Screengrab/TwitchThe cofounders said \"Daggerheart,\" a tabletop game more than two years in the making, is scheduled to launch on May 20, accompanied by a slate of CR programs and \"new offerings.\"Gameplay-wise, \"Daggerheart\" is structured like an answer to \"D&D\" — the game that made the team famous.Ray told BI that Mercer and Spenser Starke, one of \"Daggerheart's\" designers, already have \"years\" worth of ideas for game content and expansions that are in the works.Willingham says the company's Darrington Press division is also collaborating with game developers to make more products.\"We've been gamers our entire lives,\" O'Brien said. \"My hope for Darrington is that it becomes synonymous with great games and that it's attractive for the best game makers.\"4. Books and TVO'Brien fronts Critical Role's publishing push and wrote the foreword for the team's short story collection, \"Vox Machina — Stories Untold.\"Critical Role; Cheryl TehO'Brien, who fronts CR's publishing push, told BI he's excited about the slate of books the team's rolling out, including \"Der Katzenprinz,\" a children's book he wrote. In collaboration with Penguin Random House, CR also released its \"Vox Machina — Stories Untold\" short story collection this month.Riegel told BI that CR's expansion means ideas outside their wheelhouse land \"somewhere within our octopus of a company\" — and for him, that division is TV and film projects.Riegel said O'Brien is developing an idea for a TV show, and that Ray is developing an idea for a TV show and graphic novel.\"They're already in active development in various stages,\" Riegel said, hinting that the new projects will have \"nothing to do with Exandria.\"5. More animationThe Critical Role cast voices their own characters on their Amazon-backed animated series, \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"Anna Webber/Getty Images for Prime VideoRiegel — a two-time Emmy Award-winning voice director — told BI the cast is in the thick of recording two seasons of animation in partnership with Prime Video. That's the fourth season of \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" and the first season of \"Mighty Nein\" — both based on the crew's \"D&D\" campaigns.The eight cofounders, who got their start as voice actors, are playing their own characters.\"Sometimes in the same session, we'll go into the studio and record some for one animated series and some for the other, and it's a bit of a mind freak to keep it straight in our heads,\" Riegel said.In the works: 'experiential offerings'A long-running inside joke among the cofounders and their fandom is the idea of a \"Critical Role Land\" theme park, similar to Disney World. The crew has taken this idea so far that they have made theme-park T-shirts with the name on them.\"We say it's the most dangerous thing in the world to say stuff out loud at CR because it might come true,\" Willingham said.But Willingham said the crew is exploring the possibility of having \"experiential offerings\" down the road.Now, they just need \"the right partners\" and good timing, he said.Read the original article on Business Insider The eight founders of Critical Role started streaming on Twitch in 2015.

        "description": "The Apprentice, the long-running reality TV show that boosted Donald Trump’s profile, will begin streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video, the company announced Monday.The show’s first seven seasons will be available on Amazon’s streaming platform, with the first season premiering Monday and subsequent seasons arriving every week until late April.Debuting in 2004, The Apprentice and a spinoff, Celebrity Apprentice, propelled Trump to national stardom following a string of bankruptcies and bad business deals in the 1990s that had splintered his New York-based real estate empire.The series, meant to showcase Trump’s business acumen, was a major hit, and Trump’s name became a global brand that helped launch his political career. The show featured contestants taking part in various challenges for a $250,000 salary and a job with The Trump Organization.Trump expressed enthusiasm for the news on Truth Social and in a statement included in Amazon’s statement.“I look forward to watching this show myself—such great memories, and so much fun, but most importantly, it was a learning experience for all of us!” Trump said in Amazon’s release.Amazon’s decision to stream The Apprentice is the latest indication the company is attempting to strengthen its relationship with Trump, which was testy during his first term.In January, Amazon said it would release a new documentary about first lady Melania Trump, promising an “unprecedented behind-the-scenes look” at her life.Weeks before the November election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced that The Washington Post, which he owns, would not endorse a presidential candidate, sparking a wave of resignations and thousands of subscription cancellations.On Monday, a columnist who has worked at the Post for four decades resigned after she said the newspaper’s management decided not to run her commentary critical of Bezos’s new editorial policy. The policy, announced last month, narrows the topics covered by the paper’s opinion section to personal liberties and the free market.In December, Amazon said it would donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. The company also streamed the inauguration on its Prime Video service, a separate in-kind donation worth another $1 million.",

        "description": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.REUTERS/Joshua RobertsEight tech titans have taken a $266 billion blow to their collective wealth this year.Their combined net worth fell by $64 billion on Monday as the Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022.Elon Musk has had $132 billion, or 30% of his fortune, erased in 2025 following Tesla's stock slide.Eight tech billionaires have seen their combined fortunes shrink by an estimated $266 billion this year as President Donald Trump's policies continue to spook investors.That figure exceeds the market value of most of America's largest companies including Salesforce, McDonald's, and Wells Fargo.Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk leads the list of wealth losers, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The world's richest person has had $132 billion, or 30% of his fortune, wiped out in the past 10 weeks following the 45% slide in Tesla stock in that period.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang have each seen more than $20 billion erased from their respective net worths this year as their companies' stock prices have tumbled.

        "description": "Construction at a CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia.Nathan Howard/Getty ImagesData centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to the US economy from 2017 to 2023, a PwC study says.Most of those jobs were attributed to \"the multiplier effect,\" a standard and controversial model.Data centers require a massive amount of skilled labor during construction, and less after.When President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, he said the massive AI infrastructure project—a joint venture formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank—would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.\"Little evidence supports the accuracy of Trump's statement, though he wouldn't be the first politician to suggest that data centers are a boon for job creation. The data center industry has grown rapidly in recent years, and state governors have touted the jobs it would create.A new study from PwC supports these claims, reporting that data centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to national employment in 2023, up 60% from 2017. While the data center market has grown rapidly in recent years and has been fueled by the rise of cloud computing and AI, most of those jobs aren't direct tech jobs. Economic development experts are divided over the accuracy of the study, which was sponsored by data center industry lobbying group Data Center Coalition.Big Tech companies spent a combined estimated $246 billion in capital expenditures last year, much of which was on data center expansion. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are expected to spend another $320 billion in capital expenditures this year.State and local government officials have touted the number of jobs that would result from all the new development. However, once built, data center facilities don't employ large numbers of permanent employees, and the economic development contracts they sign in exchange for tax incentives often reflect that.In a press release announcing Amazon's $10 billion data center expansion in Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said in December that the investment would support \"thousands\" of jobs. Documents filed with the Ohio Department of Development showed that Amazon is committed to creating 1,058 new jobs, none of which are required to be full-time, salaried positions.The data center industry overhypes job creationOf the 4.7 million jobs attributed to the data center industry in the PwC study, only 603,900 were actual industry jobs, otherwise known as \"direct\" jobs.The Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group that counts Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta as members, commissioned the PwC study, which grouped jobs into three categories — \"direct,\" \"indirect,\" and \"induced.\"A \"direct\" job, the study said, is any job — full-time, part-time, or self-employed — tied to the operation of the data center. An \"indirect\" job refers to a full-time, part-time, or self-employed job created to produce necessary goods and services in a data center's supply chain. \"Induced\" jobs are jobs that result from spending that occurs in an area due to the data center's presence there.Nearly 4.1 million data center jobs — the vast majority of the total number of data center jobs accounted for in PwC's study — were considered indirect and induced. Indirect and induced jobs can comprise a wide range of potential positions, from the construction and maintenance of data centers to jobs in the local service industry near the data centers. The service sector, which includes everything from tourism, hospitality, and retail, to healthcare and financial services, accounted for 60% of the data center industry's induced jobs.\"DCC asked PwC to quantify the economic contributions made by the data center industry nationally as well as in each state and the District of Columbia. The report and analysis were conducted independently by PwC using publicly available government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics,\" a Data Center Coalition spokesperson said.Some economists say induced and indirect jobs can be difficult to accurately quantify.Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas's Department of Government, questioned the study's estimate of the number of jobs created by the data center industry.\"The economic impact of these projects aren't particularly high,\" Jensen said. \"It's head-shaking to me how you could come up with that jobs number.\"PwC used IMPLAN, an economic modeling software that is considered an industry standard for economic impact analysis and data. While IMPLAN has been used since the late 1970s to demonstrate potential job creation for a variety of industries, Jensen said the program is vulnerable to misuse.\"There's a lot of controversy around IMPLAN,\" he said. \"It's often used to justify economic development incentives.\"IMPLAN's model relies on the North American Industry Classification System, which the federal government uses to classify businesses, to determine the \"multiplier effect\" of an economic development project to measure the overall impact on the local economy.PwC determined that the data center industry has a multiplier effect of 7.5, meaning that every direct data center job leads to another 7.5 jobs elsewhere in the US economy.Jensen said a multiplier effect of one or two is likely more accurate.The data center boom creates construction jobsData centers do offer significant job creation opportunities, said John Boyd Jr., principal at site selection advisory The Boyd Co. — it's just that the jobs are in unexpected places.Construction jobs are bigger and more important to the data center industry than people realize, he said. Boyd's firm has helped large corporations like AT&T, Dell, and Visa choose locations for major development projects, and it has also advised government agencies on economic development deals.\"The actual amount of on-site labor is enormous, and wages are over double the national average for construction workers,\" Boyd said of data center projects.This is because data center construction requires skilled labor across a variety of expertise.\"You're looking at cooling systems, natural gas turbines, specialized server equipment,\" he said.Construction workers often travel to data center sites and stay for extended periods of time, which leads to a need for hotels, restaurants, and other services. The data center development boom has led to a surge in occupancy rates at properties owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, CEO Geoff Ballotti said on the company earnings call in February.Data centers also require routine and specialized maintenance after they are built, leading to a continued need for skilled labor nearby.The industry tends to cluster together. Once one data center is located in a certain area, others tend to follow. Ballotti said Wyndham's business development experts are focusing on expansion in areas near Jackson, Mississippi, and Columbus, Ohio, because of that.\"These aren't one and done,\" Boyd said.Read the original article on Business Insider Construction at a CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia.Nathan Howard/Getty ImagesData centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to the US economy from 2017 to 2023, a PwC study says.Most of those jobs were attributed to \"the multiplier effect,\" a standard and controversial model.Data centers require a massive amount of skilled labor during construction, and less after.When President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, he said the massive AI infrastructure project—a joint venture formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank—would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.\"Little evidence supports the accuracy of Trump's statement, though he wouldn't be the first politician to suggest that data centers are a boon for job creation.

The retail sector in the United States is competitive, and Amazon has steadily gained ground, driven by a surge in discretionary spending. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence Whole Paycheck Report, “Walmart or Amazon: Where Do Consumers Spend ‘Fun’ Money?,” discretionary spending covers “wants” rather than “needs.” It represents the products and services that consumers buy when they have disposable income, such as electronics, clothing, travel, dining out and other nonessential items. Amazon has become the preferred destination for many of these purchases, as consumers rely on the eCommerce giant for everything from electronics to apparel. Read also: Amazon Overtook Walmart in Quarterly Revenue in Q4 Amazon’s Foothold in Electronics and Appliances In the last quarter of 2024, Amazon made inroads across multiple product categories, the report found. Amazon captured 30% of the total sales in the electronics and appliances sector. This dominance in the electronics market shows Amazon’s appeal to consumers who prioritize convenience, competitive pricing and fast shipping. The ease of browsing Amazon’s inventory, coupled with its one-click purchasing feature and rapid delivery options, has further solidified its role as a leader in discretionary spending. Despite its strength in nonessential categories, Amazon has also seen modest but considerable growth in food and beverage sales, the report revealed. Although the company has historically struggled to compete with Walmart, the largest grocery retailer in the U.S., Amazon has been slowly chipping away at Walmart’s dominance. In 2024, Amazon’s share of the total U.S. food and beverage market rose to 2.7%, up from 2.3% the previous year. This may seem like a small increase, but it’s indicative of Amazon’s larger strategy to expand beyond its traditional product categories and tap into the lucrative grocery market. Amazon’s steady growth in food and beverages signals the company is positioning itself as a serious competitor to Walmart, even in this essential category. One factor driving Amazon’s expanding market share is its aggressive pricing strategies and personalized shopping experiences, the report found. The company has used large amounts of customer data to tailor recommendations and create targeted promotions, encouraging consumers to make more frequent purchases. Amazon’s advertising campaigns are another tool that helps keep the brand at the forefront of consumers’ minds, driving more traffic to its platform. Additionally, Amazon’s digital experience — combined with its product selection — gives the company an advantage over traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, especially in high-demand categories like electronics and appliances. See also: Amazon Mobile Shopping App Features Products From Other Sites Walmart Struggles to Keep Up With Changing Preferences Amazon’s growth contrasts with the performance of its main competitor, Walmart, according to the report. Despite its dominance in the grocery sector, Walmart has struggled to increase its share of total retail spending in recent years. For the year ending Jan. 31, 2025, Walmart’s share of the U.S. retail market was stagnant, with no notable spike in spending during the holiday season. This lack of growth is especially concerning given the typically strong sales period in the final months of the year. Walmart’s market share has remained relatively unchanged since the third quarter of 2020, hovering just under 7.6% of total consumer retail spending. Walmart’s slowdown is opposite to Amazon’s upward trajectory. While Walmart has maintained its stronghold on groceries and other essential goods, it has struggled to attract shoppers for discretionary products such as electronics, apparel and home goods, per the report. The retailer’s eCommerce efforts, though growing, account for a fraction of its overall sales, leaving it at a disadvantage as consumers turn to online shopping for convenience and variety. As Amazon continues to capture a larger share of discretionary spending, Walmart faces the challenge of adapting to the changing retail environment. While its consistent performance underscores its reliability as a go-to destination for everyday essentials, it highlights the broader trend of consumers favoring online platforms like Amazon for a more diverse shopping experience. The disparity in growth trajectories suggests Amazon is winning the battle for consumer dollars in nonessential categories, leaving Walmart to play catch-up in a digitally focused retail environment.

During a fireside chat at the Human[X] conference on Monday (March 10), Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said the startup will channel its resources into enabling use cases for all industries through its Claude family of artificial intelligence (AI) models, essentially balancing research breakthroughs with practical product development. “We want to help people get work done, whether it’s code, whether it’s knowledge work, etc.,” he said. “And then you can then imagine different manifestations of that” in applications for the consumer, small business and all the way to large corporations and the C-suite. That’s different from OpenAI, which is not only working on foundation AI models but also building data centers and partnering with former Apple design chief Jony Ive on a potential consumer device. Read more: Report: Altman May Have Found AI Cash in Powell Jobs’ VC Fund No Hardware in Anthropic’s Future Krieger said Anthropic’s approach is exemplified through its product tiers: the consumer-oriented Claude.ai with its $20 per month Pro subscription, solutions for mid-market companies that are often driven by CEOs or CTOs, and enterprise offerings. Krieger further noted that even Claude’s consumer use cases tend to be practical rather than entertainment-focused, citing examples of parents using Claude to manage their children’s school calendars. The startup is less interested in making Claude a “chatty … billion-user service” used for consumer entertainment, and more focused on pragmatic and professional use cases, Krieger said. But he acknowledged that there was still “dramatic underbuilding” in consumer AI applications. Anthropic’s recent partnership with Amazon for Alexa+ is one such example of letting a partner interact with the user. Claude is one of several models powering the new Alexa by providing frontier models and AI expertise; Amazon contributes a global distribution channel through Alexa’s 600 million devices as well as integration capabilities. “When you think about what we can bring to the table, it’s frontier models and the know-how about how to make those models work really well for really complex use cases,” Krieger said. However, the startup itself isn’t focused on introducing its own hardware, according to Krieger. Read more: Amazon Unveils an Agentic, Smarter and More Capable Alexa+ AI to Replace Engineers? What Anthropic is focused on is improving multimodal capabilities as a key area for further development, he said, noting that Claude’s vision capabilities need enhancement to fully leverage the model’s existing intelligence. “I think our models don’t see as well,” Krieger admitted, noting that improving this capability would unlock new applications. Anthropic, at its core, is a research-driven company. Krieger described the “dance” of aligning product development with research breakthroughs. This requires operating quickly while maintaining flexibility, as some capabilities arrive sooner than expected while others take longer to materialize. He noted that decisions about what data should be included in model retraining need to be made well in advance of product launches, requiring a clear vision of where the company wants to be six months ahead. Asked whether AI like Anthropic’s will replace engineers, Krieger said AI might affect job prospects but noted that Anthropic is still hiring engineers across its desktop, mobile and web products. He believes that AI tools let designers and product managers prototype more effectively. “In the long run, though, I do think that the way that will manifest is you just need [fewer] engineers,” Krieger explained. As for what comes after current AI advancements, Krieger mentioned the next frontier will be autonomy and “moonshots” focused on novel discoveries that are currently only limited by the “speed of exploration of ideas.” The post Anthropic CPO: Startup Isn’t Interested in Hardware or Consumer Entertainment appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which will undergo a reorganization.Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray detailed a newsroom reorganization in a memo to staff.He said the paper must evolve to new reader habits and sharpen its mission.The changes come after owner Jeff Bezos overhauled the paper's opinion pages last month.The shake-ups keep coming at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post.The Post's executive editor, Matt Murray, detailed substantial changes to the newsroom Monday, including several new leadership roles and reorganized teams.In a memo viewed by Business Insider, Murray said the paper needed to evolve to new reader habits and the rise of AI in a competitive news environment.\"That will mean less commodity news, a greater variety of story formats and a sharper focus on work that is truly riveting, relevant and reflecting a wider range of voices that speaks to a larger audience,\" he wrote to staff.\"Where we have long thought of ourselves as a writer's paper, we will become a reader's news organization,\" he added.These new changes come after months of controversy surrounding the Post and its direction under Bezos' ownership.The Post last month overhauled its opinion pages, with Bezos announcing coverage would center on two key pillars: personal liberties and free markets. That decision resulted in a swath of subscription cancellations, NPR reported — a similar response that followed the Post's decision not to run a Presidential endorsement in the last election.Martin Baron, who was executive editor of the Post from 2013 to 2021, blasted the opinion changes at the time in a statement BI, saying he was \"sad and disgusted.\" Baron added that it had been counter to Bezos' history of standing up for editorial independence at the Post during Baron's tenure.On Monday, columnist and associate editor Ruth Marcus became the latest prominent journalist to leave the Post. Marcus left after 40 years at the paper. She said a column she'd written that was critical of the opinion section changes had been axed.\"We're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years,\" a Post spokesperson told BI in a statement. \"We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"As part of the paper's ongoing reinvention, Murray announced two new leadership roles reporting to him — a managing editor to oversee the central news desk, and a head of print who will lead a team that's separate from the digitally minded newsroom.The paper is also splitting up its national department into two teams: one focused on politics and government — which Murray said will \"remain a central pillar\" — and the other on national reporting, covering issues and figures outside Washington.Murray said the Post would also combine its business, technology, health and science, and climate teams together into a new department.He added there would be new roles within WP Ventures, which is focused on social media and innovation.\"In News, we are embarked on a big effort involving all of us, and it is a disruptive one, admittedly,\" Murray concluded. \"I realize the path we are taking may not be for everyone—and that's OK.\"You can read the memo in full below:Dear All:In January, I shared thoughts on our future, and the transformation work under way in the newsroom. As you have seen from job postings in recent days, we have begun the next phase, which includes the creation of new senior roles and new teams.The process underway is exciting, and requires significant rethinking of what we do, how we do it and how we are organized to change and grow. My hope is that everyone at The Post shows up with energy, enthusiasm, and ambition as we work to reinvent ourselves for long-term success.Our journalism has many strengths, as you demonstrate every day. We build on a proud legacy and a deep well of talent and commitment as we pursue our mission of providing fair, fact-based journalism, without fear or favor, to a broad audience across the country, work that informs, delights, and engages, and that holds power to account.Now The Post needs to evolve with reader habits, new opportunities, and technological developments, particularly the smart use of AI as it continues to develop and dramatically reshape users' experiences of news. To grow on- and off-platform in a more competitive news environment, we must focus fully on finding new audiences and meeting all audiences where they are. We will do that by broadening the topics we own and deepening the distinctiveness and expertise in our journalism. That will mean less commodity news, a greater variety of story formats and a sharper focus on work that is truly riveting, relevant and reflecting a wider range of voices that speaks to a larger audience. We will focus further on ambitious journalism--scoops, unique insights and must-read narratives, and smart analysis built on expertise.Within the newsroom, we will become fully digitally oriented in our setup, workflows and journalism, better use data to shape coverage and publishing, and constantly innovate to improve our digital products and presentation with a far greater variety of formats. Text will no longer be a default and length no more a measure of quality.Our decision-making, our commissioning and even the focus of our daily mission are very diffuse across the room and too often disconnected. That is part of why we write too many incremental stories or similar stories (many of which don't get much readership) and sometimes lack enough diversity of content across departments. Our common future depends on having strong digital news products and maximizing their reach, but we don't operate that way.We must be obsessed with engagement, both what works and—being honest with ourselves —what doesn't, from headlines through story selection and length. Where we have long thought of ourselves as a writer's paper, we will become a reader's news organization.A focus in this phase is beefing up the central news desk to focus on our core digital products and drive more from the center of the newsroom. We will be hampered until we improve our daily budgeting and workflows and establish a better publishing schedule aligned with reader habits and improve our editing strength and management. To kick off the process of rebuilding the news desk, we have posted for a new Managing Editor role to build the desk up and to oversee the news day 24/7 and will upgrade digital output and presentation. The desk restructuring will lead to additional new roles as it proceeds. The job reports to me.Two other new senior opportunities attached to the desk have been posted. We are hiring a Head of Print. This new role will first create a self-contained print production desk to fully ring-fence print from the rest of the newsroom and make it completely downstream, so the majority of us can focus our efforts on our growing digital products. Once the desk is built, the Head of Print will oversee production of the daily paper, keeping our print product lively, robust, visually strong and engaging. This role will report to me.We also seek a Weekend Editor to manage the news desk and run the news day during the weekends. The Weekend Editor will report to the ME/News Hub, and work four days a week, starting Thursdays.We also are reorganizing several news departments, with the aim of broadening the range of our coverage. The existing National department becomes two new departments, one focused on Politics and Government, and one on National reporting. Politics will encompass most of our reporters and editors covering the political scene and the government, which remain a central pillar for The Post. The Economics and Economic Policy team from Business will move to this department.National, which incorporates the America team, the education team, and the GA desk in Washington, will have a remit to cover the United States and important issues and figures outside of Washington and across the country more broadly. We are posting the department head roles for both new departments, as well as several new reporting roles in each.We also are bringing several teams—Business, Technology, Health & Science and Climate—together in a new department that will bring our readers to the frontiers of the 21st century — how businesses are transforming across the economy; how scientific and technological shifts are affecting daily life; and what it all means for people's health, security and the planet. The department-head role also is being posted.Each reorganized department will have a Senior Editor for Audience Growth and a Senior Editor for Visuals. The data editors will play central roles in our daily coverage, ensuring we are properly meeting reader opportunities, and the visuals roles will aim to further deepen digital storytelling across the newsroom. The reorganization allows us to better balance these resources across the room.Along with new roles in these departments we have posted new reporting and editing opportunities to fill out some areas of coverage. They include new roles in WP Ventures, led by Krissah Thompson and Sam Henig, which continues to build out its new Creator Hub and new senior roles.We are moving to quicky fill the new department-head roles, and from there other jobs. Once leadership is in place, each department will work through a content review with our project team, led by Mark Smith, and some details still remain to be fixed. We plan to have changes in place by no later than Monday, May 5, though more moves will certainly follow as we continue our reinvention project.We have scheduled a meeting today at 3 p.m. in the Live Center on the fourth floor to talk about these changes and our ongoing transformation project. We will send a Zoom link for those unable to attend in person.It is a time of change across all of The Post, as we know. In News, we are embarked on a big effort involving all of us, and it is a",

Related Insights Brand Safety Amazon, Google and verification vendors among ad tech cohort under fire from U.S. senators over child safety shortcomings Read More A little over a month ago, a bombshell report documenting ad tech’s shortcomings in stopping the monetization of child sexual abuse material raised the ire of senior politicians and prompted leading names to tighten up their operations. Since then, the industry debate has been intense, with a growing chorus calling for more vendor transparency. And with that has come some confusion as to how the industry’s leading demand-side platforms will respond. IAB CEO David Cohen made his philosophy clear on how the industry should move ahead. “Instead of pointing fingers, it may make sense to talk about the misalignment of incentives … move the conversation from efficiency at all costs to effectiveness and starve bad actors from monetization,” he said in a LinkedIn statement.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.I began my career in civil engineering in India and moved to the US for a master's in the same field. While studying at the University of Illinois in 2011, I realized that software was driving a big chunk of innovation, and I wanted a career in tech.I started taking coding classes and built my skills to the point I was hired as the first product manager at a small startup in the Bay Area. I spent five years at the analytics software startup and saw it grow from a company of 10 to one of over 1,000 employees.I left the startup in 2018 and joined Uber as a product manager the same year. Two years later, I moved to Amazon and worked as a product lead for Amazon Web Services. In 2022, I made a career switch to Meta, where I work as a machine learning product lead.Four strategies have helped me switch industries and scale my career:1. Learn to say noSaying no is extremely hard, especially as a junior employee. You tend to overwork yourself, which can be a risk to your reputation if you overpromise and then underdeliver because you took on too much.Denying some requests can earn you more respect from your managers. It demonstrates maturity and strategic thinking because you don't allow yourself or your team to spend time on any random thing thrown at you.I see it as my job to think about what are the biggest opportunities for me and what I want to say yes to. This allows me to carve out time for projects that are important and save my team's time.One way to tackle this is by asking counter-questions about whether what your manager is asking will benefit the final product or the team. Another way is to list tasks you think are important and have high impact and ask your manager: \"Hey, I understand that this may be important, but how would you relatively think about it?\" Now, you can say no gracefully.2. Be the dumbest person in the roomThis is a strategy I first learned at the startup I worked at, where I was surrounded by senior leaders from Google. I was the first person hired on the product team, and I felt pressure to project what I knew about our product. But I found it more valuable to listen carefully to get a full picture of the company and product so that I don't fight over things I don't really believe in.Since then, I have found it valuable to play the \"dumb card\" and ask as many questions as possible, focusing on questions that uncover insights for other people. It is tempting to show that you are knowledgeable and that you have experience, but that should come from your work, not your words.Early in your career, being quiet can be hard because you feel the need to fill any silent moments in meetings and one-on-ones. It's OK to embrace the silence instead of saying something redundant. Listening intently helps you bring in fresh ideas, which helps you prioritize your long-term career development over the short-term wins at that meeting.3. Focus on relationships beyond workI focus on building personal relationships with the people I work with because good relations go beyond company and country boundaries. Also, I do my best work when I am surrounded by people I trust and enjoy working with.I ask myself whether someone I am working with would want to work with me when they leave the company. If the answer is no, I try to work on that relationship so that it lasts beyond our day to day work.4. Over-communication is keySometimes, people feel that they should not repeat themselves after making a point. But I think overcommunication is a feature and not a bug, especially in fast-paced environments where there are so many people and priorities, all working across multiple time zones.So even when I feel like I risk sounding redundant, I choose to repeat myself because there are always one or two people who miss a message you send. I utilize different channels and make sure that everybody understands me and is on the same page.Read the original article on Business Insider A Meta product manager shared four tips that helped him scale his career across Big Tech.Shailesh ChauhanShailesh Chauhan shares strategies that helped him grow his career growth across Big Tech companies.He emphasizes saying no to your managers and resisting the urge to showcase how much you know.Overcommunication is crucial in fast-paced environments to ensure alignment and clarity.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shailesh Chauhan, a product manager at Meta in the Bay Area.

        "description": "Charles O'Rear/Getty, thawornnurak/Getty, valiantsin suprunovich/Getty, twomeows/Getty, aluxum/Getty, Tyler Le/BITech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to develop a functional quantum computer.Each has released a prototype quantum chip with different approaches and potential applications.The field is rapidly evolving, but major hurdles remain before it becomes commercially useful.The quantum race is heating up.Tech titans Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft each recently announced advancements in their prototype chips, tightening the race to develop a commercially useful quantum computer that could solve some of the universe's stickiest problems faster than a classical computer ever could.Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving — though still largely theoretical and deeply technical — field. But cracking it open could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, among other outcomes, researchers say.Naturally, each of the major players in Big Tech wants to be the one to take quantum computing mainstream.\"You're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point,\" Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services, told Business Insider in late February, following the company's announcement of its Ocelot chip.Stick with us — here's where it gets complicated.Where classical computing uses binary digits — 0s and 1s, called bits — to represent information, quantum computing relies on a foundation built from the quantum equivalent of bits, called qubits. When they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits allow quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.However, qubits are unstable, and their behavior is unpredictable. They require specific conditions, such as low light and extremely cold environments, to reduce errors. When the number of qubits is increased, the error rate goes up — making advancement in the field slowgoing.Small-scale quantum computers already exist, but the race is on to scale them up and make them useful to a wider audience rather than just scientists.Recently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have announced new prototype chips, and IBM has made strides in its existing quantum road map. Each company is using unique approaches to solve the error reduction and scalability problems that have long plagued the field and make useful quantum computing a reality.Here's how each approach stacks up.MicrosoftMicrosoft's Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits.MicrosoftApproach to quantum: Topological qubitsMost powerful machine: Majorana 1In February, Microsoft unveiled its new quantum chip, Majorana 1. The aim is for the chip to speed up the development of large-scale quantum computers from decades to years.Microsoft said the chip uses a new state of matter to produce \"topological\" qubits that are less prone to errors and more stable. Essentially, this is a qubit based on a topological state of matter, which isn't a liquid, gas, or solid. As a result, these quantum particles could retain a \"memory\" of their position over time and move around each other. Information, therefore, could be stored across the whole qubit, so if any parts fail, the topological qubit could still hold key pieces of information and become more fault-resistant.\"Microsoft's progress is the hardest to get an idea about because it's very niche,\" said Tom Darras, founder of quantum computing startup Welinq. \"Even experts in the industry find it difficult to assess the quality of these results.\"Quantum experts agree that Microsoft still has many roadblocks to overcome, and its peer-reviewed Nature paper only demonstrates aspects of what its researchers have claimed to achieve — but some in the quantum ecosystem see it as a promising outcome.GoogleGoogle researchers are aiming to reverse a long-standing qubit problem.GoogleApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: WillowIn December, Google announced Willow, its newest quantum chip, which the company claims takes just five minutes to solve a problem that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years.Perhaps more impressive was Google's breakthrough in how quantum computers scale. Historically, the more qubits that are added, and the more powerful the computer becomes, the more prone it is to errors. With Willow, Google's researchers said that adding more physical qubits to a quantum processor actually made it less error-prone, reversing the typical phenomenon.Known as \"below threshold,\" the accomplishment marks a significant milestone by cracking a problem that has been around since the 1990s. In a study published in Nature, Google's researchers posit this breakthrough could finally offer a way to build a useful large-scale quantum computer. However, much of this is still theoretical, and now Google will need to prove it in practice.AmazonA superconducting-qubit quantum chip being wire-bonded to a circuit board at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing in Pasadena, Calif.Amazon Web ServicesApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: OcelotIn late February, Amazon Web Services announced its Ocelot chip, a prototype designed to advance the company's focus on cloud-based quantum computing.An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the Ocelot prototype demonstrated the potential to increase efficiency in quantum error correction by up to 90% compared to conventional approaches. The chip leverages a unique architecture that integrates cat qubit technology — named for the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment — and additional quantum error correction components that can be manufactured using processes borrowed from the electronics industry.Troy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that Amazon's Ocelot chip is another building block that the industry will use to build a functioning quantum computer. However, its error rate needs to be substantially lowered, and its chips would require more qubit density before they're useful.\"There's lots of challenges ahead. What Amazon gained in error correction was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip,\" Nelson said. \"We're still in prototype days, and we still have multiple years to go, but they've made a great leap forward.\"IBMCES patrons take a look as IBM unveils this quantum computer, Q System One.Ross D. Franklin/ASSOCIATED PRESSApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: CondorIBM has been a quantum frontrunner for some time, with several different prototype chips and its development of Q System One, the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, unveiled in January 2019.IBM's Condor chip is the company's most powerful in terms of its number of qubits. However, since its development, IBM has focused its approach on the quality of its gate operations and making its newer quantum chips modular so multiple smaller, less error-prone chips can be combined to make more powerful quantum computing machines.Condor, the second-largest quantum processor ever made, was unveiled at the IBM Quantum Summit 2023 on December 4, 2023. At the same time, IBM debuted its Heron chip, a 133-qubit processor with a lower error rate.Rob Schoelkopf, cofounder and chief scientist of Quantum Circuits, told Business Insider that IBM has prioritized \"error mitigation\" over traditional error correction approaches. While IBM has so far been successful in what Schoelkopf calls \"brute force scaling\" with this approach, he said the methodology will need to be modified in the long run for efficiency.Who leads the race?Sankar Das Sarma, a theoretical condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland, told Business Insider that the Amazon Web Services Ocelot chip, Google's Willow, and IBM's Condor use a \"more conventional\" superconducting approach to quantum development compared to other competitors.By contrast, Microsoft's approach is based on topological Majorana zero modes, which also have a superconductor, but in \"a radically different manner,\" he said. If the Majorana 1 chip works correctly, Das Sarma added, it is protected topologically with minimal need for error correction, compared to claims from other tech companies that they have improved conventional error correction methods.Still, each company's approach is \"very different,\" Das Sarma said. \"It is premature to comment on who is ahead since the whole subject is basically in the initial development phase.\"Big Tech companies should be cautious about \"raising expectations when promoting results,\" said Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO of quantum computing startup Pasqal. \"Otherwise, you could create disillusionment.\"Reymond's sentiment was echoed by IBM's VP of quantum adoption and business development, Scott Crowder, who told Business Insider he is concerned \"over-hype\" could lead people to discount quantum technology before its promise can be realized.\"We think we are on the cusp of demonstrating quantum advantage,\" said Crowder, referring to when a quantum computer outperforms classical machines. \"But the industry is still a few years from a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Charles O'Rear/Getty, thawornnurak/Getty, valiantsin suprunovich/Getty, twomeows/Getty, aluxum/Getty, Tyler Le/BITech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to develop a functional quantum computer.Each has released a prototype quantum chip with different approaches and potential applications.The field is rapidly evolving, but major hurdles remain before it becomes commercially useful.The quantum race is heating up.Tech titans Amazon, Google, IBM",

This week in artificial intelligence, Google debuted two updates for its AI features, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom plans to introduce an AI phone, Gap is pursuing AI innovations, and Amazon is developing a new reasoning model and creating an agentic AI unit. Google Expands AI Overviews and Introduces AI Mode Google is incorporating more generative AI into search with the introduction of AI Mode, as it defends its core business from being siphoned away by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. AI Mode is meant to provide a true conversational AI assistant, performing more advanced reasoning than Google’s AI Overviews, which debuted to mixed reviews. AI Mode is especially helpful for questions that need further exploration, comparisons and reasoning, Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google Search, said Wednesday (March 5). AI Mode also is multimodal, meaning it can understand other types of content besides text. Users can ask follow-up questions. Google said the first users for AI Mode will be Google One AI Premium subscribers. Others can join a waitlist. T-Mobile Parent to Debut ‘AI Phone’ Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent company, announced Monday (March 3) that it is planning to launch its AI Phone next year. With a price tag under $1,000, the device aims to natively incorporate AI, meaning AI will be embedded from the ground up instead of bolted on. The AI Phone will integrate Perplexity’s AI assistant systemwide. It will be accessible from the lock screen or through a double press of the power button. The phone’s AI capabilities will let users book taxis, make restaurant reservations, translate in real time, and perform various other functions through voice commands or text input. Deutsche Telekom partnered with Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs and Picsart to add more capabilities to the device. The phone will be unveiled later this year and start shipping in 2026. It will be rolled out in Europe first. Gap Embraces AI Innovation Gap CEO Richard Dickson said during the company’s earnings call Thursday (March 6) that the past year has been spent “fixing the fundamentals” and now the retailer is ready to focus on “continuous improvement through innovation.” Gap is pursuing innovations in AI and other areas, he said. The company formed an Office of AI that is focused on AI innovation across its operations. “In 2025, we will be developing AI monetization opportunities relative to the consumer experience, product to market, as well as organizational productivity,” Dickson said. “Now, having organized the various ways we can use AI to enable value creation, we’re prepared to mobilize against this framework with intention.” Gap Chief Financial Officer Katrina O’Connell said during the call that the company is using AI to, among other things, “create more elevated experiences for our customers with things like personalization.” Amazon Works on Reasoning Model, AI Agents Amazon is reportedly developing a new reasoning model under its Nova family of foundation models, Business Insider reported Tuesday (March 4). The model could debut as soon as June and aims to be more cost-efficient while performing on par with top AI models in tasks like math and science. It is supposed to be a hybrid reasoning model that combines fast responses with deeper, more complex analysis. Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which came out in late February, is a hybrid reasoning model that switches from fast responses to slower, more reasoned replies depending on the task at hand. Meanwhile, Amazon also said Tuesday that it is creating an agentic AI unit at Amazon Web Services (AWS). These moves exemplify Amazon’s intensified focus on advancing its AI capabilities, positioning the eCommerce giant as a contender in the AI race.

        "description": "A viral grassroots movement is calling for a consumer-led boycott against Amazon, but third-party sellers warn this will hurt small businesses more than Amazon itself. The day before a consumer-led “economic blackout” — a Feb. 28 campaign urging shoppers to boycott Amazon and other major retailers for 24 hours — Lori Barzvi sat down to write an email to the man organizing it. Barzvi, who has been selling products on Amazon since 2014, didn’t write to defend the company. Instead, she wanted to offer a reality check about who would actually feel the impact. “Believe me,” Barzvi wrote in her email to John Schwarz, the founder of The People’s Union USA, a self-described “grassroots movement” that initiated the economic blackout. The email was viewed by Modern Retail. “NOBODY hates Jeff Bezos and his cronies more than Amazon sellers. But we need Amazon to survive.”Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

The home furnishings market is witnessing a shift, with Amazon gaining ground while Walmart struggles to maintain its share. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Walmart or Amazon: Where Do Consumers Spend ‘Fun’ Money?” found that Amazon increased its share of the home furnishings market, accounting for 18.9% in 2024, up from 17.5% in 2023, marking a 102% rise from 9.2% in 2019. In contrast, Walmart is experiencing a decline in its home furniture sales, with its market share dropping 25% over the past five years, from 9.5% in 2019 to 7.1% in 2024. Despite efforts to attract younger consumers through trendy collaborations and designs, such as with Better Homes & Gardens and The Pioneer Woman, Walmart’s home furnishings strategy has not reversed the downward trend in its sales. “There is almost nothing in home furnishings that cannot be purchased on Amazon, so it is not surprising that it has become more of a magnet for shoppers,” Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at research firm GlobalData, told PYMNTS in an interview. “Walmart has struggled because a lot of its core customers have been very constrained by inflation and have not been buying as much general merchandise, including home furnishings.” Meanwhile, Greg Zakowicz, senior eCommerce expert at Omnisend, told PYMNTS that consumers seek value with their purchases. “While this behavior shift benefited both Walmart and Amazon, it underscores the fact consumers are price shopping to save money as much as ever,” he said. “The [products] between the two companies [are] similar, and brand name furniture is mostly a thing of the past, meaning price and convenience often win out. This, in my opinion, benefits Amazon.” Zakowicz said a shift in the past five years is due to several factors. “First, the lack of brand name furniture in the market combined with an influx of inexpensive foreign-made products that flooded marketplaces like Amazon made Amazon an attractive site for price comparison,” he said. “Let’s also not forget the impact COVID had on this trajectory. As online shopping became the de facto and home improvement projects accelerated during that time, Amazon was a true winner. I believe these factors made Amazon a primary destination for furniture shoppers.” Here’s a look at other developments this week from Amazon and Walmart. Amazon Highlights Amazon Launches Visual Search Features Amazon announced Monday (March 3) that it has introduced several new visual search features over the last few months to enhance the user shopping experience. The new features have led to a 70% year-over-year increase in visual searches. Customers can use visual suggestions, add text to image searches for more specific results, and launch Amazon Lens directly from their lock screens to make shopping more interactive. Other features include a “More Like This” option for finding similar items, product videos in search results, and the ability to circle and search specific items within an image. Amazon Invests $35 Billion in AI and Automation Amazon is prioritizing artificial intelligence and automation to drive efficiency in its retail operations, with a planned $35 billion investment in its retail network, including robotics-powered warehouses. The company aims to improve delivery speeds and cut costs, with automation already delivering savings at its Shreveport, Louisiana, fulfillment center, where costs were reduced by 25% after increasing robotics use. While most of its $100 billion annual spending will be allocated to AI, about 25% will be directed toward automation in eCommerce. Walmart Highlights Walmart CEO Warns of Consumer Strain Amid High Food Prices Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said he is concerned about the financial stress U.S. consumers are facing as food prices remain high, with some shoppers running out of money before the end of the month and opting for smaller pack sizes, Bloomberg reported in February. Despite prices for apparel returning to pre-pandemic levels, food prices, including eggs and beef, continue to strain budgets. McMillon said consumer behavior has remained consistent, with shoppers prioritizing value, per the report. He expressed concern over the ongoing impact of inflation on low-income households and the broader challenges retailers face due to rising costs and uncertainty in the economy. Walmart’s Projected Growth Slows Amid Tariff Concerns Walmart, the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, generates 40% of its sales from discretionary items like clothing, electronics, and toys, which are primarily sourced from countries affected by new tariffs, including China and India. For 2025, analysts predict Walmart’s revenue growth will slow to 4%, reflecting concerns over tariffs, Reuters reported in February. Brian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which invests in Walmart, plans to evaluate the impact of the tariffs by monitoring Walmart’s Great Value brand, per the report. More than 70% of the household and generic non-food products sold under the brand, such as electronics and sporting goods, come from China. During Walmart’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey projected sales growth between 3% and 4%, below analyst projections, as rising costs and uncertainties around U.S. tariffs weigh on consumer purchasing power.

        "description": "My conversations with e-commerce entrepreneurs got me thinking: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings to play with — do it? After writing about Amazon sellers for years, the author decided to try e-commerce for herself.Kathleen ElkinsAfter writing about Amazon and Etsy sellers for years, I decided to try e-commerce myself.My friend and I created a product, a pickleball paddle, and listed it on Amazon and Shopify.I wasn't fully prepared for the time commitment. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming.When I launched an e-commerce company in 2024, the main objective wasn't to make money. Though, that would be a nice consequence.Curiosity was more so the impetus.After years of writing about wealth-building strategies and interviewing people who have created revenue streams outside their traditional 9-to-5 income — everything from buying rental properties to investing in franchises to flipping sneakers — creating a product and selling it online seemed like the most straightforward way to make a couple of bucks on the side.My conversations with e-commerce entrepreneurs got me thinking: Can anyone — including a journalist in her early 30s with some savings to play with and a couple of free hours after work — do it? And what does it really take? Is starting a profitable Amazon business or Shopify storefront as simple as some of my interviewees make it out to be?My gut told me no.For starters, I was talking to business owners who had already \"made it\" — individuals bringing in tens of thousands of dollars from their Amazon or Etsy businesses who could authoritatively give our readers advice on how to do the same. For every successful entrepreneur, I'm sure there are 10 who fail.Plus, it's impossible to understand the entire story of how a business is created in a 60- to 90-minute interview. I wanted the true, full inside scoop — to understand the entirety of what goes into entrepreneurship, including the most unglamorous and underreported details — and starting my own business seemed like the only way to find out.What I wasn't prepared for: Building a business, even if it's a 'side hustle,' is all-consumingI'm over a year into the curiosity experiment and have answered one of my original questions: Can I start an e-comm business?Yes, I can! It took more money than my business partner and I budgeted, but we built a product — a pickleball paddle — and listed it for sale on Amazon and Shopify. We are officially in business.Anyone can do the same thing with a couple of thousand dollars and a lot of time. More time than you think.Working with friends to photograph the product lowered our startup costs.Kathleen ElkinsThere are the major, monthslong tasks, such as selecting a product to sell and working with manufacturers to actually bring the product to life.Then, there are the nitty-gritty tasks — the little things you don't always read or hear about: forming an LLC, opening a business bank account, purchasing a web domain, building a website, photographing your product, setting up an Amazon seller account, setting up social media accounts, understanding Amazon FBA versus FBM. The to-do list is ever-evolving and never-ending. With each online form you submit, you're 75% sure you're properly filling in the blanks or selecting the correct button, but you can never be sure.There are inevitably going to be intangibles — figuring out what to do when your manufacturer misprints text on 500 units of inventory, for example, or dealing with a surprise $2,000 expense — that also require time and brain space.When you're not at your computer or on the phone completing a task, the business seeps into every crevice of your life, taking up headspace and weaseling its way into conversations. It's omnipresent — at least, it is for me.I spend the majority of my weekly sessions with my life coach, who I've been working with before the business, talking about how to grow our brand: Peak Pickleball. On my daily jogs, my mind naturally wanders into Peak territory and, when it does, I record a voice memo mid-run to ensure I don't lose the idea of the moment. I literally fall asleep at night thinking about marketing strategies.It's even seeped into my workday. I'm writing about it now, after all, on a Wednesday afternoon.The author's studio apartment doubles as the Peak Pickleball headquarters.Kathleen ElkinsThe business takes up physical space, too. Boxes of inventory and bubble mailers that I pack the paddles in from my kitchen table encroach on my small, studio apartment.Like many entrepreneurs I've interviewed, I started this as a \"side project.\" But nothing about it feels like a side. It's a main course.Here's the thing, though: It's not an annoyance, nor does it feel like a burden. Yes, the business intrudes and invades — but it's also exciting and energizing. And, I have the benefit of splitting the load with an excellent partner.As I'm figuring out the answer to my original questions — can I start an e-comm business? (yes) and is it simple? (not exactly) — new ones have surfaced: Can I sell my product? Can I turn a profit? Can I even break even?Perhaps anyone really can get started, with some money and a lot of time and patience, but that's only half the battle.More from \"The eCommerce Experiment\":My friend and I pooled $10,000 to start an e-commerce company. After months of brainstorming products, we chose pickleball paddles.Months into launching a pickleball eCommerce company with $10,000, I'm already over budget. Here are all of my startup costs, including a surprise $2,095 expense.I launched an eCommerce company with a $10,000 budget after interviewing top Amazon sellers. Here's everything I outsourced to save time, including a $250 task that was the best money I spent.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Trump’s tariffs are yet another headache for sellers dealing with increasing costs on Amazon. Now, they are left scrambling to manage yet another costly curveball. Chuck Gregorich has spent nearly 20 years selling hammocks, patio furniture and thousands of other China-made products on Amazon. But now, President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz has upended the math behind his entire business model. In a matter of weeks, the Wisconsin-based merchant, who runs an eight-figure business on Amazon, found himself staring down a staggering $2.7 million in new tariff costs. Gregorich’s calculations factored in a 25% tariff on steel goods, a 10% levy on all imports from China that went into effect in February and an additional 10% tax on goods from China that Trump announced a few weeks later, and which went into effect on Tuesday.This is a member-exclusive article from Modern Retail.

        "description": "Several U.S. retailers that publicly scrapped diversity, equity and inclusion programs — including Target, Amazon and Tractor Supply — are maintaining certain efforts behind the scenes. The three retailers, while they’ve ended DEI programs on paper, have told advocacy groups and individuals they will continue to offer financial support for some LGBTQ+ Pride and racial justice events, as well as provide internal support for resource groups for underrepresented employees. These contradictions between public remarks to investors and those made to individuals or small groups illustrate the tightrope they’ve walked since U.S. President Donald Trump deemed some elements of DEI illegal and threatened possible investigations into firms that practice it. Advocates say DEI programs aren’t exclusionary policies, but are needed to redress longstanding bias, inequity and discrimination, while detractors counter people should be hired solely on merit without taking into consideration gender or race. Companies are “trying to thread the needle — stay true to corporate values, satisfy various stakeholders, but reduce legal risk,” said Jason C. Schwartz, an employment law partner at Gibson Dunn who advises corporate clients on their DEI policies. Reuters conducted more than a dozen interviews with company employees, advocates for underrepresented groups who’ve met with corporate executives, and consultants advising companies on DEI issues for this story. The developments they described haven’t been previously reported. Tractor Supply, which sells home and garden supplies and clothing to farmers and ranchers, in June ended a DEI program that had aimed to help put people of color in management roles and boost funding to education programs for Black Americans. It also ceased gathering data on its workforce for the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking tool that rates American businesses on their treatment of LGBTQ+ workers and customers. A Tractor Supply spokesperson told Reuters it “remained steadfast” in its “purposeful decision to remove perceived political and social agendas” from its business. But Keayana Robinson, the contractor who led the diversity data collection at Tractor Supply, told Reuters the retailer offered to keep her on in an undefined role that would be “as closely aligned as possible” to the DEI work she had been doing. Managers assured her that Tractor Supply’s inclusivity initiatives — particularly its resource groups for underrepresented employees — would continue, Robinson said. “I don’t want to work for an organization that wants to hide me,” she said. Tractor Supply declined to comment on Robinson’s account of its conversations with her. Target in January ended its participation in the HRC survey, and scrapped a DEI program that included a goal to increase the number of Black employees by 20% over three years. A Target spokesperson said the new approach “is all about driving business results by increasing relevance with U.S. consumers and making Target a destination for talent.” After Target rolled back its DEI program, Sharon Smith-Akinsanya, CEO of corporate consultancy Rae Mackenzie Group in Minneapolis, said she met with Target executives, including CEO Brian Cornell. Target has long been a sponsor of her career events in Minnesota for people of color, as well as an event she organized honoring Black women of Minneapolis. She said the meetings reassured her that Target would keep a commitment to diversity. “I believe the Target DNA we have come to love remains intact,” Smith-Akinsanya said, adding that she understands the political threats companies are facing. For some, the retailers’ private pledges or actions to continue to support diversity and minority groups don’t go far enough. Twin Cities Pride Executive Director Andi Otto said representatives of Minneapolis-based Target called him to make assurances that their inclusivity efforts would not change, despite the “changing and current climate” of anti-DEI sentiment. But his organization turned down a $50,000 sponsorship from Target this year after nearly two decades of partnering with the chain because of their changes in DEI coupled with the company removing some Pride Month products in 2023. Twin Cities Pride did not accept a sponsorship from Target this year because the company would not specify how it would continue to support LGBTQ+ shoppers and employees to the organization’s satisfactions, Otto said, calling Target’s move away from DEI “problematic.” Turning down Target’s money is a form of protest, a move that he says sends a message to Target that it can’t have it both ways. Similarly, when Black business leader Sheletta Brundidge learned Amazon had rolled back some DEI programs, she dropped the online retailer as a $10,000 sponsor of her annual Black Entrepreneurs Day held at the Minnesota State Capitol. A company representative tried to downplay the changes during a subsequent phone call, according to Brundidge, but it did not change her mind. “We’ve been working to build a diverse team for many years and are committed to continuing on that path,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said. “You’ll see us continue to inspect and evolve our programs to help us do this really difficult work well.” Amazon did not comment on Brundidge’s account. ‘PICKING THEIR BATTLES’ Some companies are keeping DEI programs despite political and legal risk. Investors at Apple voted against proposals to curtail DEI during its shareholder meeting in February. A day later, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that “Apple should get rid of DEI rules.” Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the company’s website says it is continuing to “create a culture of inclusion, belonging, and collaboration where everyone can do their best work.” Costco Wholesale shareholders in January voted down a proposal to curb its DEI initiatives. A week later, 19 Republican attorneys general demanded Costco notify the states within 30 days whether it will repeal its DEI policies or provide an explanation for maintaining them. Costco did not immediately return a message seeking comment. But the list of companies removing DEI programs in recent months has expanded to include Paramount, Walmart, Lowe’s, PepsiCo, McDonald’s, John Deere and others. Walmart, PepsiCo, Paramount and McDonald’s confirmed changing their DEI programs, while other companies did not immediately comment. Lawyers say that, as executives calculate which programs to eliminate and which to keep, they’re considering both legal and political risks. Although U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Feb. 5 threatened to criminally prosecute companies with “illegal DEI” programs that exclude individuals based on race or sex, she did not explicitly define “illegal,” lawyers say. In a memo, she said her mandate does not prohibit “educational, cultural, or historical observances … that celebrate diversity,” like Black History Month. Black Women Talk Tech co-founder Regina Gwynn said it is seeing continued support from some companies that sponsor its events for Black women founders and tech workers. But some sponsors requested to have their names left off marketing materials out of fear of political and legal retribution, she said. The programs most often retained, Gibson Dunn’s Schwartz said, are the ones tied to relationships with customers and employees: sponsorships of events benefiting underrepresented groups, employee groups that create a sense of community at work, and cultural events like Black History Month. “Companies are essentially picking their battles,” he said, “or trying to avoid battles altogether.” —Nicholas P.

        "description": "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said the company sees this year as a pivotal one for its advertising business, as well as a soon-to-launch U.S. marketplace. Earlier this week, President Trump’s just-enacted tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico were the hot topic of Best Buy’s fourth-quarter earnings call with investors — but another initiative discussed could at least somewhat blunt the impact on the retailer’s profits. In the earnings call, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said the company plans to launch its previously announced third-party marketplace some time in the middle of this year, a major change to its e-commerce strategy. Outside sellers are a huge component of Amazon’s and Walmart’s highly profitable advertising and e-commerce flywheels. More sellers drive more traffic, and that creates more advertising opportunities. Additionally, as the third-party sellers create new advertising opportunities, Barry said the company sees fiscal 2026 as a pivotal year for the advertising business.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

The CEO of Amazon-owned One Medical, Trent Green, will leave that position to become CEO of National Research Corporation, a publicly traded provider of healthcare solutions doing business as NRC Health. NRC Health announced the move in a Wednesday (March 5) press release, saying Green will join the company June 1. Green will leave One Medical April 4, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing an internal Amazon memo. “After nearly three years with Amazon One Medical, CEO Trent Green has decided to leave the company,” an Amazon spokesperson said, per the report. “We are grateful to Trent for his many contributions and wish him well on his next endeavor.” Green became CEO of One Medical in September 2023, about six months after Amazon completed its acquisition of the company, according to the report. During his time in that role, One Medical, which is a primary care provider, expanded into new geographic areas, opened more offices, and integrated further into Amazon, in part by offering services for Prime members, per the report. At NRC Health, which provides a healthcare experience management platform, Green will use his experience in care delivery, digital transformation and strategic business execution to advance the company’s personalized, data-driven solutions and strengthen its market presence, according to the press release. “I am excited to join NRC Health and lead the company during this transformative period,” Green said in the release. “I look forward to working alongside NRC’s talented associates to advance innovative solutions that enhance healthcare experiences for patients, providers and caregivers and drive sustainable growth for our investors.” When Amazon announced its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in July 2022, it said it aimed to reinvent healthcare and described One Medical as a tech-powered primary care provider that offers in-person, digital and virtual care services. It was reported in February 2024 that Amazon was cutting “a few hundred” jobs across its healthcare units One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy while working to save another $100 million in 2024 and decrease its operating losses. The cuts in its healthcare units were the latest in a series of layoffs announced by Amazon around that time.

Jeff Bezos has moved to introduce a tough Amazon-like approach to his rocket maker Blue Origin, as the world’s third-richest person seeks to revive a company that has lagged behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The space company’s founder and sole shareholder has pushed to shift its internal culture with management hires from Amazon, while implementing policies akin to the ecommerce giant, including longer working hours and more aggressive targets. Half a dozen current and former senior Blue Origin employees told the Financial Times that the billionaire had taken a prominent role in helping reset a company that has reached orbit only once, compared with SpaceX achieving the feat more than 450 times.Read full article Comments",

Amazon’s ads business is muscling in on the same ad tech players that once fueled its rise. Granted, it’s been edging into that cottage industry for years but its latest moves make those earlier steps look like a warm-up. Recently, Amazon has been rolling out features and services that were once the domain of companies like Skai and Pacvue. As Amazon tightens its grip, some casualties may be inevitable. Amazon’s UnBoxed event last November revealed the writing on the wall. The tech behemoth announced a flurry of announcements and new tools, including a complete overhauling of its demand-side platform (DSP). That overhaul included the launch of its Performance+ tool, its AI-powered, black-box style ad campaign that was designed to woo non-endemic advertisers. Amazon also introduced AI-powered creative tools and a multi-touch attribution model. (Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment.)Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) reportedly formed a new group focused on agentic artificial intelligence (AI), with AWS CEO Matt Garman saying the technology could be “the next multibillion business for AWS.” The group will be led by AWS executive Swami Sivasubramanian, who will report directly to Garman, Reuters reported Tuesday (March 4), citing an internal email written by Garman. “We have the opportunity to help our customers innovate even faster and unlock more possibilities, and I firmly believe that AI agents are core to this next wave of innovation,” Garman wrote in the email, per the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Garman noted the agentic capabilities of the new version of Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa+, in a recent post on LinkedIn. “Alexa+ can work on tasks in the background, handling complex interactions with websites and services even when you’re not actively engaging,” Garman wrote. “And it does all this while leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS)’s world-class cloud infrastructure and security to protect user privacy and data.” Sivasubramanian wrote in a post on LinkedIn that Alexa+ instantly matches each user request with the best AI model for the task and connects with users’ services like email, calendar, apps and more. “For customers, this means having AI assistant that independently completes tasks on your behalf,” Sivasubramanian wrote. “You don’t need to hold the device or select an app to take action. Alexa+ doesn’t require you to stare at a screen while you wait for the delegated action to complete.” AI agents are set to rival and even replace human software engineers, PYMNTS reported in February. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that by the end of the year, the company’s most advanced AI reasoning model could rank first in competitive programming contests. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in February that the world is just two years into the current wave of AI enhancements, starting with generative AI, which powered consumer use of AI, and now moving into AI agents, which will power business use of AI. “AI has gone mainstream,” and one day it will be embedded in all industries, Huang said Feb. 26 in a conference call with Wall Street analysts.

After launching a new version of Alexa dubbed Alexa+ last week, Amazon is reportedly preparing to release a “constellation” of devices powered by artificial intelligence (AI). “You can imagine … a constellation of devices that has to come together to make it a better experience,” Panos Panay, head of Amazon’s devices and services business, told CNN in an interview posted Thursday (Feb. 27). Panay didn’t say what devices might be included in that group, according to the report. The report noted that Amazon already has a family of devices that includes Ring security cameras, Eero Wi-Fi routers and Echo smart speakers. The company has started to add AI to some of those devices. Amazon also offers smart glasses, smart rings and fitness trackers, per the report. When the company unveiled Alexa+ Wednesday (Feb. 26), Amazon said the new version of its voice assistant is enhanced with generative AI, making it smarter and more responsive. Alexa+ can handle more complex tasks like ordering groceries, booking services, sending messages, searching video libraries and reading documents. One of its key features is its ability to remember past interactions and use them to provide more personalized responses. The new version of the voice assistant is expected to roll out soon, offering users more advanced AI features through their existing Alexa devices. PYMNTS Intelligence found in 2023 that 27% of consumers had used a voice-activated device or speaker in the previous 12 months. In addition, 54% of consumers said they would prefer voice technology in the future because it is faster than typing or using a touchscreen, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “How Consumers Want to Live in the Voice Economy.” Amazon’s debut of Alexa+ came more than a year after the company announced its plans to integrate AI into the voice assistant. The delay highlighted the challenges tech companies face in integrating AI. Apple has struggled with similar issues as it works to enhance its virtual assistant, Siri, with generative AI technology. The CNN reported noted that Microsoft is another one of the tech giants racing to add AI-powered agents and chatbots into their devices and operating systems.

Amazon’s grip on TV advertising keeps tightening, and now it’s gunning for the industry’s biggest payouts: upfront commitments and scatter market budgets. To do so, it’s launching Complete TV, a tool designed to make the notoriously convoluted process of managing those investments as seamless as clicking “Add to Cart”. The pitch is simple: Complete TV gives AI-powered recommendations to help TV buyers optimize their spending across Prime Video and other premium streaming publishers. They do this by inputting their campaign details and target audiences, and, in theory, Amazon’s machine-learning models take care of the rest, allocating spend in real-time across both linear and streaming TV. For marketers, this kind of automation tackles a persistent industry headache: delivering on upfront commitments in full. Historically, shifting audience behavior, inconsistent measurement and last-minute inventory fluctuations have made it difficult for advertisers to spend exactly as planned. So much so, in fact, that they often find themselves scrambling to move money into the scatter market to fill shortfalls — or worse, wasting budget on redundant reach.

Still, some industry insiders remain skeptical that the technology has advanced as far as the companies claim.Amazon Web Services on Thursday announced the Ocelot chip, a prototype the company said represents a breakthrough in error correction and scalability — two key issues that have long slowed advancement in the field.Amazon's announcement followed one from Microsoft on February 19 saying it had created a new state of matter to power its own new quantum chip prototype, the Majorana 1, in a development that would propel quantum computing forward.Google's Willow chip prototype debuted in December. The company said Willow could perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes — a task that would take the current fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, a timeframe that exceeds the age of the universe.The tech giants say their respective developments are massive advancements in the quantum computing field, which could eventually lead to major social advancements such as discovering new drugs, developing new chemical compounds, or breaking our current encryption methods.However, some computer scientists and physicists told Business Insider the field remains dynamic and evolving, with hurdles to overcome before quantum computing is useful.'The joke is, it's always 25 years away'Virginia Lorenz, a professor of atomic, molecular, and optical physics at the University of Illinois' Grainger College of Engineering, said there are still many technical roadblocks in the way of fully functional and commercially relevant quantum computing — meaning, quantum computers that do something useful for the average person, rather than just scientists.\"The joke is, it's always 25 years away,\" said Lorenz, who founded the first publicly available quantum network, which allows citizen scientists to experiment with the tech while visiting the Urbana Free Library. \"At least if you keep the current approaches, the problems are technical, and there are many of them, versus the situation being everyone trying different ways of solving one problem.\"Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of technology that relies on units of information called qubits rather than the binary bits used in classical computing. Qubits exist in multiple states at once and require specific conditions such as low light or extremely cold environments to replicate results reliably and without errors, which has made advancement in the field slow going.Researchers who spoke to BI agree that the two main roadblocks to advancing the quantum field lie in scalability and error correction. However, there is no consensus about how to approach, much less solve, either problem.In early February, Google told Reuters that the company plans to release commercial quantum computing applications within five years, despite skepticism from some industry insiders.A spokesperson for Google told Business Insider they're confident in their approach with Willow and the company's projected timeline for commercial quantum applications. However, they added that it's important to discern between what a company describes as a breakthrough and what the broader quantum community considers a breakthrough, highlighting the significance of the peer-review publication processes of scientific journals.While the tech giants have made some strides in showing progress on the error reduction and scalability issues using various approaches, quantum technology experts told BI they haven't come close to solving them.Troy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that each company's announcement represents another building block that the industry will use to create a functioning quantum computer rather than a solution in and of itself.\"There's lots of challenges ahead,\" Nelson said. For example, he said what Amazon gained in error correction with its Ocelot chip \"was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip.\"Rahul Mahajan, chief technology officer of the digital business transformation unit at Nagarro, a technological engineering and consulting firm, told BI the key to real advancement in quantum technology is not just about measuring or observing qubits' behavior, which the tech giants' recent papers largely focus on, but about reliably getting them to conduct the complex calculations they are capable of solving.\"One step is storing qubits and observing, the second is transformations,\" Mahajan said. \"As humans, we evolve; in chemistry, molecules evolve; nature evolves. So there are simulations now for us to do — controlled simulations — that's the next big, important stuff.\"These remaining hurdles have prompted high-profile skeptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to suggest we're still 20 years away from the technology being \"very useful.\" Even Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at AWS, told Business Insider when discussing the company's Ocelot chip debut that the 20-year timeframe is probably accurate.\"I think somewhere in between 10 and 20 years, I have some good confidence that we'll have practical, useful quantum computers in that timeframe,\" Painter said. \"But we also need to take a sort of humble and realistic approach to the work we have to do going forward.\"Previous retractions of researchMicrosoft-backed researchers have been wrong about quantum computing before.Two papers published in Nature by Microsoft-funded researchers in 2017 and 2018, which claimed to have created similar Majorana states as the company's latest announcement about its Majorana 1 chip, were later retracted.In Microsoft's latest Nature paper about its recent Majorana findings, a passage in its peer-review file suggests the journal's editorial was still skeptical of the company's claims.\"The editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices,\" the peer review file reads. \"The work is published for introducing a device architecture that might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.\"A Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has received some general questions about its methodology since its most recent Nature paper was released. They said that Microsoft has continued advancing its quantum approach since the paper was first submitted on March 5, 2024.\"Discourse and skepticism are all part of the scientific process,\" the spokesperson said. \"That is why we are dedicated to the continued open publication of our research, so that everyone can build on what others have discovered and learned.\"The spokesperson added, \"There is a lot of science to explain when it comes to quantum computing, and in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to sharing our results along with additional data behind the science that is turning our 20-plus-year vision for quantum computing into a tangible reality.\"A leading quantum physicist and CEO of a quantum software company told Business Insider that Microsoft's claim of inventing a new state of topological matter amounts to little more than marketing. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to prevent their skepticism of Microsoft's announcement from causing backlash on their own company; BI has verified their identity.\"It is an important distinction that there is no topological quantum computer today,\" the quantum physicist said.Still, the buzz around the advancement of quantum computing is a net positive for researchers, even if the announcements from the tech giants don't pan out scientifically, Lorenz, the physics professor, said.\"It's a bit of a self-feeding cycle since more funding means more interest, which means more capability and more promise, you know?\" Lorenz said. \"And I think that's a bit of why it's so suddenly in the public sphere and a major element as to why we're seeing so much news around it — because there's still a lot of work to be done to make a quantum computer that shows a definite advantage over classical computers, and actually fulfills some of the promises we've heard.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft says its Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits.MicrosoftMicrosoft, Amazon, and Google have recently announced prototypes of new quantum computing chips.Some physicists are skeptical that the field has advanced as much as the companies say.Scientists say the field remains dynamic and evolving, with hurdles to overcome before it's useful.The field of quantum computing has become increasingly prominent after recent announcements of new quantum chip prototypes from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

        "description": "When Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement in 2017, major companies—including tech giants Apple, Amazon, and Google—were quick to criticize the move. Elon Musk stepped down from his role on the president’s advisory committees in response. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the decision was “bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk.” What happened this year was very different: Trump ordered the U.S. to leave the Paris Agreement, again, on his first day in office. Zuckerberg, who was getting ready to co-host an inaugural ball for the president, didn’t comment on the news. (In an unrelated Facebook post that came shortly after Trump’s announcement about the Paris Agreement, Zuckerberg said he was “Optimistic and celebrating.”) Jeff Bezos, who previously criticized Trump and poured $10 billion into climate nonprofits, has now cozied up to the president. Other tech CEOs sat in support at the inauguration and donated millions to Trump’s inaugural committee. It’s one example of the business world’s reluctance to take any public stand against the current president. “In the first term, everyone was fighting me,” Trump said at a press conference in December when he talked about meeting with tech leaders. “In this term, everyone wants to be my friend.” Whether out of a fear of retribution and/or a belief that their companies could benefit directly from Trump, most business leaders are staying quiet. That’s true both for specific policy, like the Paris Agreement, and as the new administration veers toward authoritarianism. The muted response—not to mention the fact that some executives are embracing Trump and voluntarily ditching programs like diversity, equity, and inclusion—isn’t dissimilar to what happened when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. “The parallels of corporate conformity and subservience are quite strong,” says Peter Hayes, a professor emeritus of history at Northwestern University and the author of a new book, Profits & Persecution, about how companies responded to and collaborated with the Nazi party. When Hitler came to power in 1933, few took him seriously. As with Trump, people tended to underestimate the threat he posed. “A lot of people thought Hitler was a blowhard,” Hayes says. “He never had been to university. He’d never held a government position. He’d never had a real job in his life, aside from running messages behind enemy lines in World War I. They just didn’t take him seriously. And the antisemitism, only the worst people took that seriously—the people who believed in it took it totally seriously. Everybody else tended to sort of say, ‘Well, you know, if it comes, it’ll stop short of the kind of people I know.’” At the time, business leaders liked some aspects of the Nazi platform, including its willingness to dismantle labor unions. Those who objected to Hitler’s antisemitism thought that it could be moderated. (In the culture of the time, many Germans were antisemitic themselves—and had especially objectionable views about Jewish immigrants who had recently moved from Eastern Europe—but didn’t think that their Jewish colleagues should lose their jobs or, later, their lives.) But businesses quickly became participants in the “de-Jewification” (“Entjudung”) of their corporate boards. Some of that was driven by fear, after seeing examples of what the Nazis were willing to do. In one case, the new government arrested the editors of a newspaper in Munich and appointed Nazi replacements who fired Jewish employees. The Nazis intimidated Bosch’s CEO by arresting one of his friends. A cigarette magnate was threatened with the takeover of his property and a trial on corruption charges if he didn’t do what the government wanted. “They always were willing to use force, but they treated it as a last resort towards the corporate world,” Hayes says. “Because you can intimidate ordinary middle-class or upper-class people pretty easily. And they did. People conform.” After seeing what was happening to others, some companies started to practice “anticipatory compliance,” including Deutsche Bank, which fired Jewish members of its board before it was forced to. (In the long term, it didn’t help: Two of the bank’s directors were executed later in the war because they’d criticized Hitler.) As Hitler’s regime progressed, the corporate compliance became more horrific: seizing Jewish-owned businesses and property, using forced Jewish labor, and providing, in the case of a chemical company called IG Farben, the poison gas used to kill millions of people in concentration camps. Some companies fully embraced Nazi propaganda; others were just afraid to resist. Now, as corporate leaders fail to stand up for things they’ve advocated for in the past, such as climate action, what happened in Germany “is kind of a road map for what we’re experiencing,” Hayes says. The country is at a pivotal moment. The White House is seizing power in unprecedented ways, such as freezing funding that was already appropriated by Congress. Trump broke the law to fire inspectors general at federal agencies. Under Elon Musk, who was never elected to any office, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has started slashing jobs and funding at federal agencies, from the National Institutes of Health to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (The job cuts include accidentally firing workers responsible for nuclear security and researching the bird flu outbreak.) Musk and other Republicans have threatened judges with impeachment for blocking DOGE work that the judges say is illegal. When Musk sat in at a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump threatened to throw out anyone who objected to Musk. The White House is starting to control which journalists can be part of the press pool covering the president, something that used to happen through an independent committee. The list goes on. Hayes argues that American business leaders have caved to Trump even without the same type of intimidation that happened in Germany. But there has been some pressure: Trump threatened to jail Zuckerberg if he “interfered” with the 2024 election, for example, and then credited his own threats with forcing Zuckerberg to make changes to Meta, including ditching fact-checkers. Some of the pressure on CEOs, along with politicians and other public figures, now comes in other forms, including the fact that Trump can easily incite his online followers to violence. “We have on record Republican senators who’ve said to their Democratic colleagues, ‘I can’t speak up because I’m afraid for my family,’” Hayes says, adding that corporate leaders may also be afraid to talk because they’re worried about losing their jobs. “This is the normal form of human self-protection that dictatorial and authoritarian forces totally exploit.” Hayes points out other parallels to Nazi Germany. Hitler, like Trump, didn’t worry about long-term impacts to the economy. Hitler wanted Germany to be self-sufficient, and pushed for companies to make gasoline from coal, even though it was far more expensive than importing fuel from other countries. Similarly, Trump is trying to prop up fossil fuel companies in the U.S. at a time when the rest of the world is moving to electric vehicles—and EVs ultimately make more economic sense. “We’re giving up the future to serve the fossil fuel industry in the short term, and to try to make us an island in the world,” Hayes says. “It’s not going to work. The bill will come due. And as it starts to come due, everything that Trump has ever done indicates that he will blame someone else. And that’s when this government will become truly dangerous.” In Germany, Hayes says, the first year of Hitler’s rule was the critical moment that businesses could have made different choices. In theory, it’s not too late for companies—along with the rest of society—to become more vocal now. Hayes, however, doesn’t believe that salvation is likely to come from the corporate sector, warning, “Don’t expect them to stand up to this.”",

        "description": "Female streamers are being told to hire security after a spate of recent attacks. Popular Twitch stars Valkyrae, Cinna, and Emiru were out in public at the Santa Monica Pier on March 2 as part of their “sisathon” streaming marathon, when a man lunged toward them, saying, “I’ll kill you right now.” The streamers called for help from security as the man chased them before the stream turned off. He had tracked their location using the live broadcast and earlier had gotten down on one knee, proposed to the three streamers, and asked one for her phone number, which she refused. Issuing an update later that evening on X, Cinna posted, “Hey everyone we are safe. Unfortunately, we have to end the marathon and need time to process what happened as we shock at the moment.” hey everyone we are safe.unfortunately we have end the marathon and need time to process what happened as we shock at the moment. Thank you for all the love and support on the marathon. We love you all.— cinna (@cinnabrit) March 3, 2025 Other streamers have rallied around the Twitch stars, advocating for increased safety measures, particularly for women in the industry. Popular streamer xChocoBars, who has advocated for more action to be taken against stalkers targeting streamers, posted on X: “The police and security need to do more for women who get stalked. I’m sick and tired of this law where they can’t do anything until something HAPPENS.” QTCinderella also shared details for the security firm she employs while streaming in public. “There have been times where they have had to be with me 24/7. It could save your life, save their info,” she posted on X. That same night, another popular streamer experienced a harrowing incident in her home. Amouranth, whose real name is Kaitlyn Siragusa, posted on social media that she’d been robbed at gunpoint by thieves trying to steal her crypto funds. “I’m being too robbed at gunpoint. I believe I shot one of them. They wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed,” Amouranth posted on her X account on March 2 at 11:55 p.m. The Kick streamer and adult content creator later explained why she posted to X instead of calling emergency services. “Was at gun point they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence,” she wrote. The attack comes just months after Amouranth posted a screenshot of a Coinbase account showing in excess of $20 million in BTC and ETH, along with the message, “Do I sell or hold my BTC?” Private security firms, such as Fast Guard Service, have reported a recent surge in demand from influencers spanning various platforms. Creators are now experiencing a number of concerning side effects that come with online fame, including unwanted attention, harassment, and even physical threats. What used to be an occupational hazard reserved for Hollywood celebrities and high-profile politicians is now a growing reality for influencers and internet personalities.",

Twitch is expanding its monetization and moderation tools, and creators see the move as an attempt to regain ground lost to competitors such as Kick and YouTube. In an open letter penned by Twitch CEO Dan Clancy on Feb. 27, the company revealed a slew of updates for 2025, including the opening up of monetization features such as subscriptions and Bits (a virtual currency that users can purchase from Twitch and donate to creators) to streamers of all sizes, as well as the expansion of the platform’s moderation functions. Previously, Twitch creators could only enable subscriptions and Bits by joining the platform’s affiliate program, whose guidelines require users to stream for at least eight hours on seven different days and average at least three viewers per stream to qualify. Now, users will be able to turn on subscriptions and Bits from the moment they create their Twitch account, although other monetization features, such as Twitch’s advertising revenue share, remain available only to Twitch partners or affiliates.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "If Alexa becomes a bigger part of Amazon’s ecosystem, it opens up even more real estate for ads. Amazon just raised the walls of its walled garden. Last week, the company finally pulled back the curtain on its long-awaited Alexa overhaul, a chattier, more personalized and supposedly more useful version of its voice assistant. Generative AI powers this new version, called Alexa+, which is available beyond just Echo devices, spreading across car infotainment systems, connected TVs and anything else running Alexa. This is Amazon’s latest attempt to deliver on the grand vision it pitched a decade ago: making voice as intuitive for controlling devices as touch. So far it’s been more gimmick than game-changer, but early reactions to this newest update suggest that could change. If it does, the bigger question isn’t what Alexa can do, it is how Amazon plans to cash in.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Three major breakthroughs are shaking up the world of quantum computing to potentially enable real-world applications so advanced they could only run on quantum computers — in five years. Last week, Amazon unveiled its first quantum computing chip, Ocelot, that uses scalable architecture to reduce the costs of implementing quantum error correction by up to 90%, the company claims in a blog post. Ocelot’s architecture uses a “cat qubit,” named after Schrodinger’s cat thought experiment, which suppresses certain forms of errors and minimizes the resources required to correct these errors. This advancement puts quantum computers one step closer to practical deployment for real-world applications, with costs falling to as little as 20% of current approaches, according to Amazon. “Concretely, we believe this will accelerate our timeline to a practical quantum computer by up to five years,” said Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware for Amazon Web Services (AWS). In mid-February, Microsoft unveiled a new state of matter besides solid, liquid or gas, bringing additional excitement to quantum computing. The unearthing of the topological superconductor, or topoconductor, forms the core of its new Majorana 1 quantum chip, which it said is scalable to a million qubits and more stable. In early February, Google Quantum AI lead Hartmut Neven said that he was “optimistic” that in five years there will be real-world applications that could only be powered by quantum computers. Typically, it would take several years to decades to do so. Neven’s remarks followed Google’s debut of its Willow quantum chip last December that the company said could reduce errors “exponentially” as it scales up with more qubits. Willow can perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today 10 septillion (1025) years, Google claimed. What Is a Quantum Computer? Quantum computers are computers so powerful they can pull off complex calculations and simulations that will take today’s supercomputers thousands, if not millions, of years to solve. Quantum computers can exponentially speed up the processing of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, which includes training of AI models and inferencing, which is when the trained models are deployed to analyze new data. But what is a quantum computer and how is it capable of these feats? Think of a quantum computer as a hyper-powerful computer as compared to traditional or “classical” computers — like comparing a bicycle to a rocket. Since quantum computers can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical machines, they can do things like revolutionize drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, a task that would take classical supercomputers exponentially more time, per IBM. They can make chemical processes more efficient and safer through simulating chemical reactions. For example, it could reduce the emissions from ammonia manufacturing, which now makes up 2% to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to Google. Also per Google, quantum computers can lead to the development of higher-performing electrochemical batteries, which makes electric vehicles charge faster and drive farther — while on a grid with an always-on renewable power supply. Quantum computing, Microsoft writes, also could help lead to the discovery of a new material that can “heal” itself — repairing cracks in bridges or airplane parts; it could develop a solution to break down all types of plastics; or create enzymes that sustain the growth of agriculture in harsh climates. Quantum computers are based on quantum mechanics, which is a branch of physics that explains how tiny particles, like atoms and electronics, behave, as the U.S. Department of Energy explains. But unlike traditional physics, in quantum mechanics particles can exist in multiple states at once, be instantly connected over vast distances, and behave unpredictably until they are measured. These strange properties are the foundation of quantum computing. Bits vs Qubits To understand the significance of quantum computing, it is helpful to first consider how classical computers work. Traditional computers process information through a series of operations on binary bits of 1s and 0s. Whether running complex simulations, analyzing data or just surfing the internet, all computations are based on a sequence of 0s and 1s. But this computing system has its limits. Quantum computing is much more powerful due to two properties. The first is superposition, in which qubits exist in a combination of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. Think of it as a spinning coin that can be either heads or tails until it lands. This ability lets quantum computers process many potential outcomes in parallel, making them much better problem-solvers. The second is entanglement, in which two or more qubits become correlated so that the state of one is directly related to the state of the other, regardless of distance, per Argonne National Laboratory. This connection lets quantum computers perform complex calculations more efficiently than classical systems. Albert Einstein called this phenomenon “spooky action at a distance.” Quantum’s Limits However, quantum computers are not general-purpose machines that will replace classical computers, Gartner pointed out in a September article. Rather, they excel in specific tasks where classical computing struggles. Classical systems remain superior for everyday computing needs, from running business applications to streaming media. Quantum computers are best suited for solving highly complex, specialized problems that would otherwise take a classical system many years. Another drawback is qubit stability. Because qubits are highly sensitive to their environment, they can lose their quantum state — what’s called decoherence — before computations can be completed. There are several ways to create qubits; Microsoft said it pursued topological qubits, which it believed would lead to more stable qubits and fewer errors. Another obstacle is scalability. Current quantum processors contain only a few dozen qubits, large-scale quantum computing will require thousands, if not millions, of them. Microsoft said it has developed a quantum chip based on a topological superconductor core, that can scale to a million qubits. While quantum computers are still years away from being widely available and practical, accelerated advancements in this field show its potential to becoming one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century by opening the door to solving problems that were once thought impossible.

        "description": "Hollywood is waking up to the power of influencers. That starts with MrBeast. Amazon’s Beast Games cost hundreds of millions to produce. Some of that came from the streamer, but much of it came from the pockets of MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson. On the Diary of a CEO podcast, he estimated “tens of millions” in losses from the show, admitting that he was an “idiot” for spending so much. But it was all for one goal: To knock down the Hollywood door so other creators could score their own production deals. But MrBeast misunderstands the power balance. In the attention economy, influencers have the eyeballs right now. Amazon’s acquisition of Beast Games was massively successful; the show garnered 50 million viewers in just 25 days, Amazon’s second largest series debut in 2024. Did MrBeast get any new fans? Likely not, given how critically panned the show was. MrBeast got fleeced by Amazon, and is setting up more creators to do the same. The streamer gets the viewers, while the influencers are left in the red. Who has the power: MrBeast or Amazon? MrBeast dug into his own pockets to produce Beast Games. His deal with Amazon was reportedly worth around $100 million. But, on Diary of a CEO, he acknowledged that spending for the show went far beyond that—and the excess came from his own funds. Even just the first two episode’s sets cost around $15 and $14 million, respectively. “I would have more money if I didn’t film it,” he said. A deal between Amazon and MrBeast has the promise of being mutually beneficial. Amazon gets the eyeballs of every 10-year-old munching on their Feastables. MrBeast gets some cash to produce the show, plus the possibility to expand beyond his cloistered YouTube presence. But MrBeast seems to have faltered on both of these gains. Spending “tens of millions” out of pocket, the Amazon investment didn’t save him from going into the red. (Plus, he’s likely racking up legal fees after contestants sued him and Amazon for sexual harassment and “chronic mistreatment.”) In terms of audience expansion, the results look dismal, too. Reviews panned Beast Games, calling it an “undignified spectacle” and “surprisingly dull.” His follower count has grown modestly throughout the show’s release, but there was no noticeable spike. It’s hard to imagine anyone watching Beast Games that wasn’t already watching his YouTube content. For Amazon, amassing 50 million viewers in 25 days is a feat. The only show to grow quicker on the streamer in 2024 was Fallout, and that had the benefit of video game IP. But, for MrBeast, 50 million viewers is chump change. His videos frequently reach that threshold within days, if not hours. Ultimately, Amazon needed MrBeast more than MrBeast needed Amazon. While the shine of a streamer is enticing, it didn’t benefit his business. The failures of influencers in Hollywood “Creators don’t have a good rep when it comes to doing stuff on streaming platforms,” MrBeast explained on e Diary of a CEO. His goal was to break down barriers, to open up these Hollywood studios to online celebrities. Per his account, it worked: He could think of two creators who had shows lined up based on Beast Games’s success. But there’s a reason why influencer shows don’t work. They sever the stars from the form they’re famous for. TikTok’s Hype House could film themselves dancing for hours and hours, but failed when it came to reality television. The Netflix show was repeatedly called depressing by critics, and some cast members say the show fabricated storylines. James Charles is best when he’s reviewing makeup; hosting a reality competition show, he flails. Still, these shows do well. Over a year after its release, Hype House was still gaining hundreds of thousands of eyes, per Netflix’s 2023 data dump. He’s All That, the ill-fated remake starring TikToker Addison Rae, soared even higher, catching 15 million viewers two years after release. That’s because these creators have name brand. The streamers rake in all those rabid fans, while the influencer’s brand is diluted. Hollywood is alluring. Everyone wants to be on TV. But, for these online superstars, they seem to give more than they get.",
