        "description": "Snacking divisions across big CPG companies like General Mills and Campbell's show signs of weakness, as customers cut back on what they deem to be junk food. Americans’ appetite for snacking may be finally satiated. CPG giants have recently warned during their earnings calls that due to growing economic pressures and high grocery prices, more shoppers are forced to hold off on snackable items and focus on core meals. Moreover, when people are buying snack items, they’re prioritizing more nutritious alternatives like jerky, nuts and rice cakes over chips and cheese crackers. Now, big food manufacturers that make some of America’s most popular snacks are feeling a slowdown in sales. General Mills, which reported its earnings on Wednesday, said its organic net sales are expected to drop 2% to down 1.5% this fiscal year, compared to a flat rate the previous year.
