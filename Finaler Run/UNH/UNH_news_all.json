        "description": "The stock price of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is sinking yet again this morning after reports that the private healthcare company is now under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) over possible Medicare fraud. The company says it has not been notified by the DOJ about the alleged investigation, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal. As of the time of this writing, UNH shares are currently down over 6% to $289.20 per share in premarket trading. UNH shares have not seen that low since 2020. Before today’s premarket fall, UNH shares had already been hammered since 2025 began. The stock closed at $308 yesterday, marking a more than 39% decline since the year began. Over the past six months, UNH stock had fallen 48% as of yesterday’s close. However, a majority of the stock’s fall has happened in the past five days. As of yesterday’s close, the stock was down more than 21% over the period—and today’s further fall is only adding to its losses. Here are three reasons why UNH shares have fallen this week, including the latest news about the reported DOJ criminal investigation. CEO Andrew Witty abruptly steps down On Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group investors were hit with a double whammy of bad news, which sent the stock tumbling as much as 18% that day. The first bit of that bad news was the announcement that UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty was abruptly stepping down from his role as chief executive. Witty had been in the role since 2021 and was a leader whom investors adored. During his tenure, shares in UnitedHealth Group had soared more than 60%. However, after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024—and the glee with which many Americans reacted to it—Witty wrote a much-maligned op-ed in the New York Times. Witty was criticized as being out of touch with the negative experiences of customers who have been denied coverage for critical and sometimes lifesaving health procedures. Announcing Witty’s immediate departure on Monday, UnitedHealth Group did not give any detailed explanation of the unexpected move. The company merely said that Witty was stepping down for personal reasons. When a CEO abruptly leaves a company, it can make investors nervous. And nervous investors often sell, which is what happened on Tuesday after the announcement of Witty’s departure. However, Witty’s departure isn’t the only thing that sent UNH shares falling 18% that day. UnitedHealth Group suspends 2025 outlook Also announced on Tuesday was that UnitedHealth Group had decided to suspend its 2025 outlook. When a company suspends its fiscal outlook, it’s a sign to investors that it does not have a lot of confidence in its financial projections for the next year. This uncertainty makes investors nervous and is another reason why the stock plummeted 18% on Tuesday. The reason UnitedHealth Group gave for suspending its 2025 outlook was due to the fact that medical costs for the company’s new Medicare Advantage customer base were higher than expected. Announcing the suspension of its 2025 outlook, UnitedHealth Group’s new CEO, Stephen Hemsley, said he was “deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges.” The suspension of the 2025 outlook followed a cut that UnitedHealth Group made to its 2025 outlook last month. That cut came after the company missed its quarterly earnings expectations for the first time in more than 10 years. Rumored DOJ criminal investigation Investors were surely hoping yesterday that the worst news for UnitedHealth Group this week was behind it. After the 18% drop in UNH shares on Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group’s stock price closed down just over 1% yesterday—a sign the bleeding had mostly stopped. But now UNH shares are down more than 6% this morning in premarket trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that UnitedHealth Group is now under a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over possible Medicare fraud. The Journal was light on details in what the alleged criminal allegations covered, saying “the exact nature of the potential criminal allegations against UnitedHealth is unclear,” but it added that it was focused “on the company’s Medicare Advantage business practices.” The Journal’s reporting of a criminal investigation follows a February report from the paper in which it said that UnitedHealth Group was facing an investigation from the DOJ over its Medicare billing practices. Insurers get paid lump sums from the government via the Medicare Advantage system, and if patients have certain conditions, those lump-sum payments could be higher. In its February report, the Journal reported that “Doctors said UnitedHealth . . . trained them to document revenue-generating diagnoses, including some they felt were obscure or irrelevant.” It added, “The company also used software to suggest conditions and paid bonuses for considering the suggestions, among other tactics, according to the doctors.” At the time, UnitedHealth Group called the Journal’s report “misinformation.” Reached for comment about the Journal‘s latest report, UnitedHealth Group referred Fast Company to a statement published on its website: “We have not been notified by the Department of Justice of the supposed criminal investigation reported, without official attribution, in the Wall Street Journal today. The WSJ’s reporting is deeply irresponsible, as even it admits that the ‘exact nature of the potential criminal allegations is unclear.’ We stand by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program.” Fast Company has also reached out to the DOJ for comment. We will update this post if we hear back.",

        "description": "UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons and the nation’s largest health insurer suspended its full-year financial outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs.Chairman Stephen Hemsley will become CEO, effective immediately, the Minnesota company said.Hemsley was UnitedHealth Group CEO from 2006 to 2017. He will remain chairman of the company’s board. Witty will serve as a senior adviser to Hemsley.“Leading the people of UnitedHealth Group has been a tremendous honor as they work every day to improve the health system, and they will continue to inspire me,” Witty said.Witty joined the company in 2018 after serving about nine years as CEO of the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. He was named UnitedHealth’s CEO in February 2021, replacing Dave Wichmann.UnitedHealth became one of the nation’s largest companies under Witty’s leadership. Total revenue topped $400 billion last year, a 55% increase from the $257 billion UnitedHealth brought in the year before Witty became CEO.Shares of UnitedHealth rocketed higher under Witty, up 60.5% since he took the company’s top job.Yet in the past five months, that stock performance reversed sharply, coinciding with the fatal shooting of company executive Brian Thompson in front of a New York City hotel late last year.The company has wrestled with the media attention focused on Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on a federal murder charge in the killing of Thompson.The case has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.UnitedHealth cut its 2025 forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in more than a decade. Shares of UnitedHealth, which have plummeted 38% since the deadly Dec. 4 ambush of Thompson in midtown Manhattan, fell 9% before the opening bell on Tuesday.UnitedHealth said Tuesday that it suspended its 2025 outlook as medical costs of many Medicare Advantage beneficiaries new to UnitedHealthcare were higher than expected.“To all stakeholders, including employees and shareholders, I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during a conference call. “Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency.”More than 50 million people have health insurance under UnitedHealth Group Inc. It also has a large pharmacy benefit manager that runs prescription drug coverage and a growing Optum segment that delivers care and provides technical support.UnitedHealthcare is the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with more than 8 million customers. Those are privately run versions of the federal government coverage program mostly for people ages 65 and older.

UnitedHealth Group is reportedly increasing its use of artificial intelligence across its business. The company has 1,000 AI applications in production, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday (May 5). It uses the technology in its insurance, health delivery and pharmacy divisions. UnitedHealth’s AI transcribes conversations from clinician visits, summarizes data, processes claims and controls customer-facing chatbots. In addition, roughly 20,000 of the company’s engineers use AI to write software, according to the report. Half of these applications use generative AI and the other half employ a more traditional version of the technology, said Chief Digital and Technology Officer Sandeep Dadlani, per the report. UnitedHealth’s push into the AI sector is happening as the company, and the industry at large, is facing increased scrutiny, the report said. When CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in New York City last year, it sparked a wave of outrage against health insurers. UnitedHealth is also facing a Department of Justice civil fraud probe related to its billing practices. The company’s AI initiatives have drawn legal attention, according to the report. For example, a class action suit in 2023 accused UnitedHealth of using a flawed AI algorithm to evaluate and unfairly deny claims. A federal judge in February permitted the lawsuit to proceed but threw out five out of seven counts. Meanwhile, the use of chatbots in healthcare has sparked debate about the effectiveness and reliability of AI. Last year, the World Health Organization introduced an AI health assistant, although there were some questions about its accuracy. Experts said chatbots could have an impact on the healthcare business, but their varying levels of accuracy raise crucial questions about their potential to support or hinder patient care. “Like other AI-powered tools, medical chatbots are more likely to provide highly accurate answers when thoroughly trained on high-quality, diverse datasets and when user prompts are clear and simple,” Julie McGuire, managing director of the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence & Innovation, told PYMNTS in April 2024. “However, when questions are more complicated or unusual, a medical chatbot may provide insufficient or incorrect answers. In some cases, a generative AI-powered medical chatbot could make up a study to justify a medical answer it wants to give.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "UnitedHealth Group spent nearly $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, the healthcare conglomerate disclosed on Monday, months after the fatal shooting of senior executive Brian Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel in December. The company also paid $207,931 on behalf of certain family members of the executives to provide them with personal and home security services, it said. The security spending disclosures, absent from UnitedHealth’s previous annual filings, underscore how the December shooting is prompting companies to reassess the risk of targeted violence against top management. U.S. drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly also increased spending on security for their top executives in 2024, regulatory filings showed last month. “We believe that these security services are appropriate and necessary given the risks associated with executive officer positions at the company,” UnitedHealth said in the filing. Brian Thompson, the former CEO of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance unit UnitedHealthcare, was shot dead on December 4 outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where the company was holding an investor conference. The filing also showed UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty’s total compensation for 2024 was $26.3 million, compared with $23.5 million a year ago. The conglomerate spent $150,951 towards Witty’s security, while $926,989 was paid for Heather Cianfrocco, the CEO of the company’s health services unit Optum. Following Thompson’s murder, health insurers removed pictures of their executives from corporate websites. In January, organizers at a major San Francisco healthcare meeting increased security for attendees inside and outside the venue. In past years, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies have typically covered the use of private jets and provided limited security-related compensation, according to earlier filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. —Sriparna Roy, Reuters",

[…] The post UnitedHealth: Medicare Issues Fueled ‘Unusual and Unacceptable’ Earnings appeared first on PYMNTS.com. UnitedHealth Group is downgrading its 2025 revenue forecast because of issues with its Medicare business. Speaking during a conference call Thursday (April 17) discussing first-quarter earnings, CEO Andrew Witty said the company began the year in two different ways. The first way was to provide more healthcare benefits and services to more members and patients. “The other way, however, was an overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable,” Witty said on the call. The company said in a Thursday press release that its new outlook is net earnings of $24.65 to $25.15 per share and adjusted earnings of $26 to $26.50 per share. It’s driven in part by “heightened care activity indications within [its] Medicare Advantage businesses, which became visible as the quarter closed, far above the planned 2025 increase, which was consistent with the elevated levels in 2024,” the release said. “This activity was most notable within physician and outpatient services.” In addition, Witty told investors that the company added more new Medicare patients to its Optum Health program, some of whom were covered by plans that were exiting markets. “They experienced a surprising lack of engagement last year, which led to 2025 reimbursement levels well below what we would expect and likely not reflective of their actual health status,” Witty said during the call. “Additionally, many of the current and new complex patients we serve are more affected by the CMS risk model changes that we are in the process of implementing. To be sure, it is complicated, but we’re not executing on the model transition as well as we should. We must and will work to better anticipate and address these factors.” The earnings came one day after a report in which the company said it was trying to improve communications with customers and make its system easier to navigate following the shooting death of former UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson. The killing turned accused shooter Luigi Mangione into a sort of folk hero among Americans fed up with the health insurance system in the United States. Tim Noel, who took over the insurance unit when Thompson died, said per a Bloomberg report that management is “acknowledging that there are challenges, there are problems.” “We are fixing them,” he added. Company officials said they are speeding up decisions on requests for care, otherwise known as prior authorizations; reducing the number of medical services subject to those hurdles; and enhancing communications with customers when a request or claim is denied.

        "description": "Shares of ​​UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) plunged by more than 22% Thursday morning after the company reported underwhelming first-quarter earnings and revised its full-year outlook. The health insurance giant lowered its 2025 earnings forecast, now projecting net earnings of $24.65 to $25.15 per share and adjusted earnings of $26.00 to $26.50 per share. This marks a downgrade from its January guidance, which anticipated net earnings between $28.15 and $28.65 per share and adjusted earnings in the range of $29.50 to $30.00 per share. “UnitedHealth Group grew to serve more people more comprehensively but did not perform up to our expectations, and we are aggressively addressing those challenges to position us well for the years ahead, and return to our long-term earnings growth rate target of 13 to 16%,” CEO Andrew Witty said in a statement. The outlook was a result of two factors, the company revealed. First, UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Advantage plans saw more people using medical services than expected—especially visits to doctors and outpatient care. This increase was clear at the end of the quarter and was much higher than the company planned for 2025, although it was similar to high usage levels it saw in 2024. On top of that, Optum Health, a division of UnitedHealth Group, had some unexpected changes in its patients. Some health plans left certain areas, and the people covered by those plans didn’t use services much in 2024, which affected the planning for how much money would come in for 2025. Also, more patients than expected were “complex” cases, people with serious or multiple health issues, and were heavily affected by past cuts to Medicare funding. The number of people served by the company’s offerings for seniors and people with complex needs grew by 545,000 in the first quarter and remains expected to grow up to 800,000 in 2025, according to the report. The company said these factors are “highly addressable” over the course of 2025 and it looks ahead to 2026. Other insurance stocks are tumbling, too The health insurance sector saw significant stock sell-offs following what appeared to be surprising financial troubles at industry leader UnitedHealth, according to the Wall Street Journal. Humana, for instance, saw an 8% decline. Elevance Health and CVS Health saw their stock prices fall about 6% each early Thursday morning. UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of $109.6 billion, marking a $9.8 billion increase year-over-year, with first-quarter earnings from operations totaling $9.1 billion.",

        "description": "U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting and killing Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance division, in New York last year. In a statement, Mangione’s lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo called the decision to seek the death penalty “barbaric.” “While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi,” Friedman Agnifilo said. Mangione, 26, has pleaded not guilty to New York state charges of murder as an act of terrorism and weapons offenses. He could face life in prison without parole if convicted in that case. New York does not have the death penalty for state charges. Mangione faces a parallel federal indictment in Manhattan federal court over Thompson’s killing, which is where Bondi said prosecutors will aim for the death penalty. He has not yet been asked to enter a plea to the federal charges. If Mangione is convicted in the federal case, the jury would determine in a separate phase of the trial whether to recommend the death penalty. Any such recommendation must be unanimous, and the judge would be required to impose it. Thompson was shot dead on December 4 outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel, where the company was gathering for an investor conference. “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson – an innocent man and father of two young children – was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statement. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,” Bondi said. The brazen killing of Thompson and ensuing five-day manhunt captivated Americans. Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, found Mangione on December 9 with a 9-millimeter pistol and silencer, clothing that matched the apparel worn by Thompson’s shooter in surveillance footage, and a notebook describing an intent to “wack” an insurance company CEO, according to a court filing. While public officials condemned the killing, some Americans have cheered Mangione, saying he drew attention to steep U.S. healthcare costs and the power of health insurers to refuse payment for some treatments. He is currently being held in federal lockup in Brooklyn. Bondi lifted a moratorium on February 5 on federal executions imposed in 2021 by her predecessor Merrick Garland, the attorney general under Democratic President Joe Biden. —Doina Chiacu and Luc Cohen, Reuters",

UnitedHealth, the biggest MA insurer, has specifically been accused of gaming the system in order to extract high payments from the federal government. The company has denied the accusations.Health insurer trade group AHIP says it will engage with the new administration on MA, which now cares for more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries.\"More than 34 million Americans choose Medicare Advantage because it provides them better care at lower costs than fee-for-service.

The executive was granted anonymity so they could speak freely about the breaking news.\"Part of that conversation is about coding, and diagnosing whether patients are sick and if so, what can we do about it?\" the executive said. The executive referred to a recent special master's ruling that the Justice Department failed to prove a long-running claim that UnitedHealth Group exaggerated how sick MA patients were, leading to more than $2 billion in overpayments to the insurer. \"That's probably our best example of, let's have this conversation about Medicare Advantage,\" the executive said.On Monday, the Better Medicare Alliance launched a video ad urging President Trump to \"secure and protect\" Medicare Advantage, a further signal that some industry players see threats to the program looming ahead.\"We share Dr. Oz's goal of strengthening Medicare Advantage for seniors and taxpayers, and we look forward to working with him on policy solutions to accomplish this,\" Mary Beth Donahue, CEO of the group, told Axios in a statement after Friday's hearing. The first major test of the administration's stance toward the program will occur in the coming weeks, when it will finalize MA payment rates for next year.
