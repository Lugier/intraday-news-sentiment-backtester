In a memo to staff, the firm's executive committee announced that it was asking employees to return to the office four days a week.The memo, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said the new requirement would take place starting September 2, 2025, the day after Labor Day. The firm, commonly known as BNY, has required its workers to be in the office three days a week since 2023. Managers were called back to the office four days a week earlier this year.The switch comes as companies from Amazon to AT&T start asking workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Similar efforts are unfolding across Wall Street: JPMorgan Chase called its workers back to the office five days a week earlier this year, prompting some workers to explore unionization efforts or look for new jobs. The memo from BNY's executive committee focuses on the importance of community and culture, which requires that employees spend more time together in the office. It also emphasized the importance of \"personal flexibility.\" Indeed, BNY told its 51,000-plus employees it has \"no plans\" to require five days a week. It said employees will also continue to have the flexibility to work two weeks a year from anywhere, a perk the bank has dubbed \"work from anywhere.\" The bank, which also offers wealth management and investment advice, had previously instituted a 2-week \"recharge period\" around the end of each year, which allows employees to work remotely and skip non-essential activities, like internal meetings.See the memo below:As we continue to place even more emphasis on our community and culture, we believe that it is important that all of us spend more time together working, leading and learning from each other. As a result, we have decided that it is appropriate to ask all employees* to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2, 2025.As a leadership team, we're committed to maintaining personal flexibility, and will continue to support remote work one day a week. We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.We also want to remind everyone that we provide a \"work from anywhere\" benefit and a range of other benefits to help colleagues care for their mental and physical health and wellbeing.

A Bloomberg report released late Monday (April 14) says that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon have scaled back electronic information sharing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) following a significant breach of the regulator’s email system. Bloomberg cited individuals familiar with the matter. The breach, detected in mid-February but impacting over 100 accounts for more than a year, is deemed a “major incident” by the OCC and the U.S. Treasury. The compromised emails may contain highly sensitive data provided by banks, including details on their financial health, cybersecurity protections, vulnerability assessments, and even the content of National Security Letters. These letters often involve confidential information related to terrorism and espionage investigations. According to Bloomberg, the banks’ decision to limit information sharing stems from concerns about potential security risks to their own computer networks in the wake of the OCC breach. Representatives for JPMorgan and BNY declined to comment. A spokesperson for the OCC told the network that the agency is working with third-party cybersecurity experts to review the hack and its IT security policies and is keeping supervised institutions informed. The OCC also affirmed that onsite examiners retain necessary access to bank information. Citigroup, operating under a tighter OCC consent order, has reportedly not limited its information sharing. It remains unclear if other major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have taken similar actions as JPMorgan and BNY. Bloomberg’s sources indicate that some banks were unaware of the breach’s full extent until recent reporting, raising questions about the OCC’s initial response and security measures. The OCC is still working to determine the exact scope of the data compromised and whether affected banks need to be notified. The incident has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which are seeking more information from the OCC. David P. Weber, a former OCC enforcement counsel, described the banks’ actions as a “historic” challenge to the regulator’s authority, signaling a “fundamental breakdown of the examination authority of the OCC.” Experts quoted in the Bloomberg report warn that the compromised material could be used for targeted cyberattacks or extortion against banks. The breach highlights the cybersecurity risks within the financial sector and has eroded trust between banks and their regulator. The OCC has disclosed some affected staff accounts to the banks but has not yet detailed the types of data stolen, including cybersecurity-related information.
