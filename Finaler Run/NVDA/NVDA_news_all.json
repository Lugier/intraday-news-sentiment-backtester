        "description": "While many are hopeful about AI's impact on the economy, there are still some threats to stock-market dominance for the sector. REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschAI stocks have surged since November 2022, with Nvidia up 761% and Palantir more than 600%.But some experts warn of high valuations and potential overestimation of AI's economic impact.Geopolitical risks, like China-Taiwan tensions, could also disrupt the AI supply chain.Since November 2022, artificial intelligence stocks have been the place to be in the market.Nvidia is up 761% over that time. Palantir is up 604%. Taiwan Semiconductor has returned 165%. And Microsoft is up 88%. It's been a gold rush.But how long can the AI trade last? Some experts, like Morgan Stanley's Head of Global Research Katy Huberty, have said that we're still in the early innings of the technology and robust returns still lie ahead.Few seem to refute the idea that AI will transform the US economy to some degree and be an eventual boon for profits. But some have urged caution about investing in the theme after such a huge run of outperformance. Irrational exuberance and greed are running rampant, they worry, potentially setting AI stocks up for a spectacular bust somewhere down the line.While the outlook on the technology's role in the economy is bullish, there are some threats to AI's dominance in the stock market. Five of them are detailed below.1. ValuationsGenerally speaking, AI stocks are expensive with their prices relative to their earnings over the last 12 months at elevated levels.For example, the iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY) has an average trailing 12 months PE ratio of 35.2, and the The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is trading at 36.7 times earnings. Nvidia trades at a 45 PE ratio. By comparison, the S&P 500, which is at historically expensive levels, has a 23.7 PE.While AI stocks may have stronger growth prospects than those in other industries, high valuations mean those prospects are already priced in. If actual earnings performance underwhelms compared to expectation, then the stocks could start to underperform.High valuations tend to weigh on long-term performance. For example, Microsoft traded at 72-times trailing earnings in 2000. While it went on to lead the way in internet technology, it didn't recover its 2000 highs until 2016.2. AI technology doesn't end up being quite as impactful as investors thinkAI may make tasks more efficient, but perhaps not to the degree the market thinks, said Jim Covello, head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, in a June 2024 report.\"People generally substantially overestimate what the technology is capable of today. In our experience, even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results,\" Covello wrote.\"This is not a matter of just some tweaks being required here and there; despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful for even such basic tasks,\" he continued. \"And I struggle to believe that the technology will ever achieve the cognitive reasoning required to substantially augment or replace human interactions.\"This could hurt AI firms, which are pumping hundreds of billions into building out AI infrastructure. What if, in the end, the mammoth spending isn't worth it?3. Current leaders may not remainAnother risk is that you end up investing in the wrong stocks altogether.Just because certain stocks are pioneering a technology, doesn't mean that they will continue to do so.The presumption five years ago \"would have been that Intel would be the dominant player\" in the AI space, Research Affiliates Founder Rob Arnott told BI in November. \"Well, Intel is teetering perilously close to irrelevance, and Nvidia wasn't on anyone's radar screen five years ago. So disruptors get disrupted.\"4. Rising long-term interest ratesAs foreign investors start to pull back from US Treasury bonds amid an expanding national debt, and as tariffs and Trump's tax cut bill threaten to boost inflation, long-term Treasury yields are trending upward.When long-end yields go too high, it has historically hurt growth stock performance and brought down valuations. Higher-risk free yields start to attract money, and risky and expensive stocks start to lose their luster.5. Geopolitical uncertaintyOne of the key players in AI development is chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor.If China were to invade Taiwan, as it has threatened, the AI supply chain could be severely interrupted.\"The moment conflict starts in the Taiwan Strait, you have to assume that TSMC shuts down very, very quickly regardless of what any of the players decide to do — regardless of whether anyone decides to disrupt the supply chain or destroy this or that or not,\" said Chris Miller, author \"Chip War,\" in an interview with BI last year.\"Taiwan imports a big chunk of its energy and chip factories need energy. And there are a bunch of critical chemicals and materials that are imported into Taiwan, and those would stop,\" he continued. \"What's more, you couldn't get the ships out of Taiwan if there was a shooting war going on. And so your incentive to produce a lot also declines very rapidly if you can't actually sell chips or get them off-island.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Ian Buck has spent his career building CUDA, Nvidia's most important software.Bloomberg/ Getty ImagesIan Buck is a lesser-known force behind Nvidia's technological moat and market share.His reputation as a masterful developer changed the course of Nvidia's history — and its future.How Nvidia maintains its moat and what's next for the company, in part, lies with Buck.Ian Buck, Nvidia's vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing, felt a twinge of nostalgia during CEO Jensen Huang's keynote presentation at their GTC conference in March.Huang spent nearly eight minutes on a single slide listing software products.\"This slide is genuinely my favorite,\" said Huang onstage in front of 17,000 people. \"A long time ago — 20 years ago — this slide was all we had,\" the CEO continued.Buck said he was instantly transported back to 2004 when he started building the company's breakthrough software, called Compute Unified Device Architecture.Back then, the team had two people and two libraries. Today, CUDA supports more than 900 libraries and artificial intelligence models. Each library corresponds to an industry using Nvidia technology.\"It is a passionate and very personal slide for me,\" Buck told reporters the next day.The 48-year-old's contribution to Nvidia is hard-coded into the company's history. But his influence is just beginning. CUDA is the platform from which Nvidia jumped to, at one point, 90% market share in AI computing. CUDA is how the company defends its moat.CUDA started with two libraries. It now has more than 500.AP Photo/Nic CouryOne architecture to rule them allDion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of high-performance computing and AI factory solutions, sometimes forgets that he's in the room with the Dr. Ian Buck. Then it hits him that his boss, and friend, is a computing legend.Since Buck's undergrad days at Princeton in the late 1990s, he had been focused on graphics — a particularly punishing field within computer science with no obvious connection to AI at the time.\"Computer graphics was such a dweebie field,\" said Stephen Witt, the author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" which details Nvidia's rise from obscurity to the most valuable company in the world.\"There was a stigma to working in computer graphics — you were maybe some kind of man-child if this was your focus,\" Witt said.While getting his Ph.D. at Stanford, Buck connected multiple graphics processing units with the aim of stretching them to their limits. He had interned at Nvidia before pursuing his Ph.D., so he was familiar with the GPU. Initially, he used it for graphics like everyone else.Buck has said that he and his cohort would use the chips to play video games such as \"Quake\" and \"Doom,\" but eventually, he started asking himself what else his gaming setup could do.He became fixated on proving that you could use GPUs for anything and everything. He received funding from Nvidia and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, among others, to develop tools to turn a GPU into a general-purpose supercomputing machine. When the company saw Brook—Buck's attempt at a programming language that applied the power of GPUs beyond graphics, Nvidia hired him.He wasn't alone. John Nickolls, a hardware expert and then director of architecture for GPU computing, was also instrumental in building CUDA. Buck may have been forever paired with Nickolls if the latter had not died from cancer in 2011.\"Both Nickolls and Buck had this obsession with making computers go faster in the way that a Formula 1 mechanic would have an obsession with making the race car go faster,\" Witt told BI. (The author said Huang expressed frustration that Nickolls doesn't get the recognition he deserves since his passing.)Buck, Nickolls, and a small team of experts built a framework that allowed developers to use an existing coding language, C, to harness the GPU's ability to run immense calculations simultaneously rather than one at a time and apply it to any field. The result was CUDA, a vehicle to bring parallel computing to the masses.The rise of CUDA as an essential element in the world of AI wasn't inevitable. Huang insisted on making every chip compatible with the software, though hardly anyone was using it despite being free. In fact, Nvidia lost millions of dollars for more than a decade because of CUDA.The rest is lore. When ChatGPT launched, Nvidia was already powering the AI computing revolution that is now the focus of $7 trillion in infrastructure spending, much of which eventually goes to Nvidia.King of the nerdsBuck's smarts do have limits. He joked to an eager audience at GTC that quantum chromodynamics, a field of particle physics, just won't stick in his brain. But he thrives in Nvidia's notoriously rigorous environment.The Santa Clara, California, company has an intense culture that eschews one-on-one meetings and airs missteps and disagreements in public. It might sound terrifying, but for those with the brains to keep up, the directness and the rigor are ideal.For this report, Business Insider spoke with four people who have either worked directly with Buck at Stanford, Nvidia, or both.Those who know Buck personally describe him as gregarious and easygoing but capable of intensity when goals are on the line. He's focused on results rather than theory.In his public remarks, at panels and in interviews on behalf of Nvidia, Buck volleys from rapid, technical lines of thought to slower, simple descriptions in layman's terms.At a GTC press conference, he detailed the latest development in convolutional neural networks and then described proteins as \"complicated 3D squigglies in your body.\" He describes the tiny, sensitive interconnects between parts of an Nvidia chipset like the Geek Squad explaining the back of a TV from memory — it's all in his head.Harris said storytelling ability is particularly important in the upper ranks at Nvidia. Since the company essentially had a promising technology waiting for a market for years, Huang still sees being early as a business strategy. He has branded it \"going after zero billion-dollar markets.\" The potential of AI, \"AI factories,\" and the infrastructure spending that goes with them is a story Nvidia can't stop telling.Buck's shilling skills have improved over the years. But even in 15-year-old footage, he's most animated when explaining the inner workings of Nvidia's technology.\"A lot of developers are amazing, but they say, 'Leave me alone. I'm going to write my code in the mountains somewhere,\" Paul Bloch, president of Nvidia partner DDN, told BI. Nvidia's leaders aren't like that, he said. Much of Nvidia's upper echelon may have the skills to match the reclusive set, but they don't choose between showmanship and code.Ian Buck's next actIan Buck's work at Nvidia began with a simple mandate: make the GPU work for every industry. That mission is very nearly accomplished. There are hundreds of CUDA libraries targeting industries from weather forecasting to medical imaging.\"The libraries are really there to connect the dots so that every business doesn't have to learn CUDA,\" Harris said.CUDA draws its strength from millions of developers, amassed over decades, who constantly innovate and improve on the platform. So far, no one has caught Nvidia's heels, but the competition is coming faster than ever.Even as Buck spoke at GTC, developers across the world were trying to break through CUDA's dominance. The first night of the conference, a cast of competitors convened by TensorWave, an AI cloud company exclusively using chips from Nvidia's only US rival, AMD, held an event entitled \"Beyond CUDA.\"Tensorwave cofounder Jeff Tatarchuck said it included more than \"24 presenters talking about what they're doing to overcome the CUDA moat.\"AMD, which also presented at the event, is making an explicit effort to catch up on the software side of AI computing, but industry analysts say they're not there yet.Harris told BI Buck's team spends a lot of time speaking with researchers to stay on top. That's always been true, but the nature of the work has changed. A decade ago, Buck was convincing researchers to apply accelerated computing to their problems; now the tables have turned.\"One of the most challenging parts of my job often is to try to predict the future, but AI is always surprising us,\" Buck said at a Bank of America conference this month. Understanding what the smartest minds in AI need from Nvidia is paramount.Many saw DeepSeek, the company that spooked markets with its ostensibly cheap reasoning AI model, as a threat to Nvidia since the team bypassed CUDA to squeeze out the performance gains that allowed it to achieve competitive results with less compute.But Buck recently described the Chinese team as \"one of the best CUDA developers out there.\"AI is entering a new phase as more companies commercialize their tools. Even with Nvidia's enormous head start, in part built by Buck, the pace is intense.For example, one of the products Nvidia debuted at GTC, Dynamo, is an inference computing platform designed to adapt to the rise of reasoning models. Nvidia launched Dynamo a couple of months after the DeepSeek earthquake, but some users had already built their own versions. That's how fast AI is evolving.\"Inference is really hard. It's wickedly hard,\" said Buck at GTC.Talent is also a big part of how Nvidia is going to try to maintain its dominance, and another place where, Witt says, Buck has value beyond his technical skills. He's not exactly a household name, even at Stanford.But for a certain type of developer, the ones who can play in Buck's extremely complex sandbox, he is a draw.\"Everyone's trying to hire these guys, especially after DeepSeek,\" said Witt. \"This was not a sexy domain in computer science for a long time. Now it is white hot.\"\"Now these guys are going for big money. So, I think Ian Buck has to be out there advertising what his group is doing,\" Witt continued.Nvidia declined to make Ian",

ROHM’s power device portfolio spans both silicon and wide bandgap technologies, including silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), offering a strategic path for data center designers. The company’s silicon MOSFETs are already widely adopted across automotive and industrial sectors, providing a cost-effective and reliable solution for today’s power conversion needs. These are ideal for applications where price, efficiency, and reliability must be balanced, making them a strong fit for transitional stages of AI infrastructure development. A standout example is the RY7P250BM, a 100V power MOSFET endorsed by major global cloud providers designed specifically for hot-swap circuits in 48V power systems—an essential component in AI servers. Key features include best-in-class SOA (Safe Operating Area) performance and ultra-low ON resistance (1.86 mΩ) in a compact 8080 package. These characteristics help reduce power loss and improve system reliability—crucial requirements in high-density, high-availability cloud platforms. As data centers transition from 12V to 48V and beyond, hot-swap capability becomes critical for maintaining uptime and protecting against inrush currents. Industrial-grade rectification with minimal losses is an area where ROHM’s SiC devices excel and align with NVIDIA’s plans to begin large-scale deployment of its 800V HVDC data center architecture to power 1 MW compute racks and beyond. At the heart of NVIDIA’s new infrastructure is the conversion of 13.8kV AC from the grid directly into 800V DC. The initiative is designed to address the inefficiencies of traditional 54V rack power systems, which are constrained by physical space, copper overload, and conversion losses. ROHM’s SiC MOSFETs deliver superior performance in high-voltage, high-power environments, offering higher efficiency through reduced switching and conduction losses, greater thermal stability for compact, high-density systems, and proven reliability in mission-critical applications. These characteristics align perfectly with the requirements of the NVIDIA 800 V HVDC architecture, which aims to reduce copper usage, minimize energy losses, and simplify power conversion across the data center. Complementing SiC, ROHM is advancing gallium nitride technologies under the EcoGaN brand. While SiC is best-suited for high voltage, high current applications, GaN offers exceptional performance in the 100V to 650V range, with superior breakdown field strength, low ON resistance, and ultra-fast switching. ROHM’s broad EcoGaNTM lineup includes 150V and 650V GaN HEMTs, gate drivers, and integrated power stage ICs. At the same time, proprietary Nano Pulse ControlTM technology further improves switching performance, reducing pulse widths to as low as 2ns. These innovations support the growing demand for smaller, more efficient power systems in AI data centers. Beyond discrete devices, ROHM offers a lineup of high-power SiC modules, including top-side cooling molded packages such as the HSDIP20, equipped with advanced 4th Gen SiC chips. These 1200V SiC modules are optimized for LLC topologies in AC-DC converters and primary-side applications in DC-DC converters. Engineered for high-efficiency, high-density power conversion, they are particularly well-suited for the centralized power systems envisioned in NVIDIA’s architecture. Their robust thermal performance and scalability make them ideal for 800 V busways and MW-scale rack configurations. The transition to an 800V HVDC infrastructure is a collaborative effort. ROHM is committed to working closely with industry leaders like NVIDIA as well as data center operators and power system designers to provide the foundational silicon technologies needed for this next generation of AI factories. Our expertise in power semiconductors, particularly in wide-bandgap materials like SiC and GaN, positions us as a key partner in developing solutions that are not only powerful but also contribute to a more sustainable and energy-efficient digital future.",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday (June 11) that Anthropic CEO’s prediction of artificial intelligence (AI) destroying half of entry level white collar jobs “doesn’t make sense.” [contact-form-7] Dario Amodei reportedly made the comment last month, adding that he expects it to happen within one to five years. He also believes that it would raise the unemployment rate to 10% to 20%. The unemployment rate for May was 4.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During a private briefing with journalists and analysts at the VivaTech 2025 conference in Paris, a relaxed and candid Huang said it didn’t make sense to him that Amodei believes AI will take all these jobs and also imply that Anthropic should be the only one to develop AI. Also, Huang pointed out why it is illogical for Amodei to say AI can be dangerous. Huang said if AI was so dangerous, the solution is not to leave it in one company’s hands — like Anthropic — but rather open it to the world. “Do it in the open,” Huang said. That way, there will be many eyes on it. Expect AI Changes Huang’s personal belief is AI will change everyone’s jobs, including his. Since AI makes companies more productive, he believes it will actually end up creating more jobs than cutting them. Those companies that are cutting jobs are ones that have run out of good ideas, Huang said. Asked if he believes AI poses an existential threat to humanity, Huang said it won’t happen if one rogue AI system is watched by many other AI systems. Right now, there isn’t a lot of monitoring in place. But as AI costs come down, there can be as many AI systems watching as possible. The Future of AGI As for when he thinks society can achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI, Huang said there are engineering and theological definitions of AGI. On an engineering level, the AI system has to pass math, coding, science and other tests. If the AI can match or surpass a human’s general abilities, then it has achieved AGI. However, Huang said he can’t answer the theological question. On autonomous driving, Huang said large language models (LLMs) and generative AI will enable the capability. Today’s self-driving vehicles have bolted-on capabilities — radar, cameras, GPS, route planning, mapping solutions, connectivity and other modules. That makes them brittle, Huang said. With LLMs, Nvidia is able to make an end-to-end solution, he added. Huang also believes that one day, humans will be able to talk to their cars just like one converses with ChatGPT. Even the lawn mower could one day talk to their users. The CEO also shed light on news regarding Mistral AI developing AI data centers in partnership with Nvidia. The plan of Mistral AI CEO Arthur Mensch is to create the “CoreWeave” of Europe, Huang revealed. CoreWeave provides AI data centers in the cloud. Today’s cloud computing giants offer cloud services using traditional data centers that are not optimized for AI. Projects like OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate aim to build AI data centers with intense computing power and energy sources needed to process AI workloads. Mensch plans to create AI data centers that will offer cloud computing services to clients, just like CoreWeave does. “That’s his plan,” Huang said. Nvidia’s aim is “to find and introduce him to financing and customers we work with here” as well as provide chips. The session ended with Huang taking selfies with analysts and journalists in an intimate setting. “I’m super afraid of public speaking, you know.” Read more: Oracle to Buy $40 Billion Worth of Nvidia Chips for First Stargate Data Center Read more: Why Is Silicon Valley Spending a Fortune on AI Data Centers?

France took a major step forward in asserting its artificial intelligence (AI) power Wednesday (June 11) as home-grown startup Mistral AI and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia announced a landmark partnership to develop next-generation AI cloud services in France. [contact-form-7] During a high-profile panel at the Viva Tech 2025 conference, French President Emmanuel Macron, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch showcased a rare confluence of political power, industrial ambition and startup ingenuity. “This is a game changer,” Macron said, praising the new collaboration as key to strengthening France’s technological independence. He added that the project would bolster French sovereignty with its own AI cloud, data centers and computing capacity. The initiative, which centers around building AI data centers in France using Nvidia chips, would expand Mistral’s business model. The AI startup — widely considered Europe’s OpenAI – would transition from merely being a model developer to a vertically integrated AI cloud provider. Mensch said he got this idea for a French AI data center after hearing from enterprise customers who were looking for a European provider alongside U.S. hyperscalers Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We’re still doing models,” Mensch said, “but on top of that, we are going to be operating more of our software platform on digital assets that we’re deploying — and that we’re deploying together.” The partnership also reflects a broader vision shared by Huang, who used the occasion to reinforce his belief that national AI sovereignty is not just strategic — it’s existential. “A country can outsource a lot of things,” Huang said. “But outsourcing all of your intelligence makes no sense.” “The intelligence of your country encodes, embeds its people’s knowledge, history, culture, common sense, values,” Huang added. “That intelligence cannot be outsourced.” “The data of your country belongs to your country … like the land belongs to your country,” Huang continued, adding that “you should find a way to learn how to harvest that data and transport that data into AI.” The Mistral partnership is Nvidia’s bet on building regional AI ecosystems beyond Silicon Valley. “Great technology companies are built with great leadership, great founders, great scientists,” Huang said, calling Mensch “brilliant … the best hope” for Europe. See also: Mistral Debuts Corporate Chatbot Amid Threefold Rise in Revenue A Presidential Phone Call The AI data centers project didn’t come together by accident — it took a nudge from the French president. Huang revealed that he asked for Macron’s help to connect Mistral with France’s largest companies. “I was at the president’s office,” Huang recounted. “I told Mr. President that Arthur Mensch needs the support of the largest companies in France. And Mr. President says, ‘Who are they? Let me call them.’ And he called them.” Within days, Macron had rallied France’s top corporate leaders to back the initiative. Macron positioned this as part of a broader strategic shift. “We want to cooperate with the Chinese, American, Korean solutions,” he said, “but we want to be sure that we will choose this cooperation — we will not be dependent on them.” Mistral’s evolution — from a lean team of AI scientists to an enterprise software and infrastructure provider — illustrates a new French AI playbook that emphasizes self-reliance, agility and cultural sovereignty. “The approach in Europe has to be much more hands-on,” Mensch said. “It’s long, it’s complicated to get into an enterprise to bring value with AI. But once you learn that, then you’re in a very good position.” Mensch emphasized the need to embed local expertise into AI systems. “The only way you’re going to be able to do that is to use all of the data that is getting produced by your operations,” he said. “You want to build your own intelligence not only at the country level, not only at the European level, but also at the enterprise level.” The Mistral-Nvidia deal marks a major milestone, but Macron made it clear it’s just the beginning. “We want now to go upstream,” Macron said. That means manufacturing chips in France, not just deploying them — an ambition he tied to earlier French industrial efforts with SGS-Thomson and STM in the 1990s. For Huang, who’s spent over 30 years steering Nvidia from graphics chips to global AI leadership, the stakes are clear. “You don’t need the world’s absolutely best AI that is generic,” he said. “You need the best AI for you.” Read more: Mistral AI CEO Arthur Mensch: Open Source Enables Cost-Effective, Powerful AI Read more: Stellantis and Mistral AI to Develop AI-Powered In-Car Assistant Read more: France Fines Apple $162 Million, Alleging Privacy Tool Violated Competition Law The post French President Rallies Behind Mistral-Nvidia Cloud Partnership appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Nvidia and Perplexity partnered to facilitate the deployment of sovereign artificial intelligence models across Europe and the Middle East. [contact-form-7] The project will aid in the deployment of AI models that reflect the regions’ languages and cultures and store the data locally, the companies said in separate Wednesday (June 11) announcements. The first European models are expected to be launched later this year, according to the announcements. Nvidia’s technology and partners will provide the AI infrastructure for the project, the chip maker said in a press release. About a dozen model builders and AI consortiums across Europe and the Middle East have teamed up with Nvidia to optimize their AI models using its technology and techniques. “Together with Europe’s model builders and cloud providers, we’re building an AI ecosystem where intelligence is developed and served locally to provide a foundation for Europe to thrive in the age of AI — transforming every industry across the region,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the release. Perplexity said in a Wednesday blog post that it will integrate sovereign European AI models into its answer engine to deliver “locally-optimized, culturally-aware AI” to users and support Europe’s digital sovereignty initiatives. These models will provide insights that incorporate European languages, cultural contexts and local knowledge, according to the post. In addition, because they will run on European AI infrastructure from Nvidia Cloud Partners, their data will stay in Europe. “This is just the beginning of a new era in AI — one where global platforms can seamlessly integrate locally-optimized intelligence to serve users better,” Perplexity said in its post. It was reported in May that Nvidia was working to lessen its dependency on Big Tech by forging new partnerships to sell AI to national governments, corporations and challengers to companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. These sovereign AI deals make up a key part of Nvidia’s strategy of attracting customers beyond Silicon Valley, the Financial Times reported May 18. In March, it was reported that more than 90 European technology companies and industry groups appealed to the European Commission to establish a sovereign infrastructure fund dedicated to advancing investments in cutting-edge technologies. The coalition said there was a pressing need for Europe to assert greater control over its critical digital infrastructure, including software applications, AI frameworks and hardware components.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is turning his attention to the next critical enabler of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution: quantum computing. [contact-form-7] “There’s an inflection point happening in quantum computing,” Huang said Wednesday (June 11) at the Viva Tech 2025 conference in Paris. “It is clear now we’re within reach of being able to apply quantum classical computing in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.” Huang had famously bet Nvidia’s future on AI and GPUs about a decade before the technology became a household name. At a keynote speech at Viva Tech, which is France’s version of CES, Huang revealed Nvidia is positioning itself to take advantage of the next stop in AI’s timeline. Quantum computing is a class of computers that are magnitudes more powerful than today’s classical computers. Quantum computers can enable faster processing of AI, which is smart software. Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can process much more data than classical computers, which store data in bits, or ones and zeroes. Huang expressed a more optimistic view of quantum advancements after comments he made in January tanked some quantum stocks. Back then, he cast doubt on whether useful quantum computers could come online in the next 15 years, according to CNBC. Huang later said he was wrong. At Viva Tech, Huang unveiled CUDA-Q, a new extension of its CUDA platform designed for quantum-classical hybrid computing. CUDA-Q is an open-source hybrid computing platform that lets the hardware and software needed to run quantum computing applications work together. “For at least the next generation of supercomputers, every single one of them will have a QPU (quantum processing unit) assigned and QPU connected to GPUs,” Huang predicted, describing a future where quantum and classical architectures work together to solve problems once thought unsolvable. Huang said that just as Moore’s Law once predicted exponential growth in classical computing, quantum computing is now poised for a similar trajectory. “I can totally expect 10 times more logical qubits every five years, 100 times more logical qubits every 10 years,” Huang said, citing advances in error correction, robustness and scalability that are now within reach. Beyond quantum, Huang also unveiled Nvidia’s next-generation Grace Blackwell platform, which Huang described as a “thinking machine” architected for reasoning and planning. This hardware leap enables the creation and operation of digital twins — digital replicas of physical systems that can be designed and tested virtually before being deployed in the real world. “Because of the scale and the speed by which we can now simulate almost everything, we can turn everything into a digital twin,” Huang said. “Everything physical will be built visually.” But these AI capabilities need a new type of data center. Huang calls them AI factories. While they may look like traditional data centers, they are not places to merely store and retrieve files. Instead, AI factories process and generate smart tokens (such as groups of words and other data) for AI applications, Huang said, just as car factories manufacture vehicles. “Every country, every society, every company will depend on” intelligence infrastructure, Huang said. “Europe has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories, the importance of the AI infrastructure.” Read more: Quantum Leap: 3 Key Developments Chart Path to Real-World Applications Robotics for SMBs Huang traced AI’s evolution from perception (computer vision and recognition) to generative AI (multimodal models capable of producing images, text and other data forms), and now to agentic AI. He defined this new paradigm as intelligence that can perceive, reason, plan, and execute tasks — mirroring the steps of human thought and action. Agentic models enable systems to break down complex problems, research solutions, use tools and act step by step — moving far beyond simple pattern recognition prevalent in one-step generative AI such as prompting ChatGPT and getting a response. Moreover, agentic AI is not limited to the digital realm, according to Huang. It can be embedded in robots to make them act more intelligently and with context in the physical world. “The fundamental technology to enable agents, which are basically information robots and embodied AI physical robots, … are now upon us,” Huang said. This vision is underpinned by Nvidia’s Omniverse platform, which provides a simulation environment for developing, training and deploying both virtual and physical agents. Digital twins powered by Omniverse are being used to simulate factories, warehouses, rail stations, and even fusion reactors before they’re built to increase efficiency and reduce risk. It is being used by companies such as Mercedes Benz and BMW. Huang also announced that Nvidia is partnering with Schneider Electric and French startup Mistral AI to build large-scale AI clouds optimized for open and proprietary models. These clouds are intended to enable both foundational model training and enterprise-grade agentic AI applications. Nvidia’s industrial AI cloud, launching in Europe, will support real-time design and simulation, from wind tunnels to humanoid robot motion training. Huang described this as the fourth industrial revolution — following steam, electricity, and information — anchored by the convergence of simulation, robotics and generative AI. With robotics becoming smarter and more customized, Huang sees a day when even mom-and-pop stores and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) will have their own robots. These robots will be teachable, reusable, and deployable in industries that could never afford automation before, Huang said. “It was impossible to have that programming capability — until now.” See also: Nvidia CEO: Why the Next Stage of AI Needs A Lot More Computing Power Read more: Nvidia Launches GPU Marketplace to Broaden Access to Its Chips Also read: Nvidia Wants to Use AI in the Real World, From Biotech to Transportation For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.\"And when it answers, you could say, 'I feel like you could do even better.'

You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.\"And when it answers, you could say, 'I feel like you could do even better.'

Nvidia has teamed with the U.K.’s financial watchdog to help companies explore artificial intelligence (AI). [contact-form-7] The collaboration, dubbed the “Supercharged Sandbox,” lets financial services companies experiment with AI using Nvidia computing and software, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced in a news release Monday (June 9). “This collaboration will help those that want to test AI ideas but who lack the capabilities to do so,” Jessica Rusu, the FCA’s chief data, intelligence and information officer, said in the release. “We’ll help firms harness AI to benefit our markets and consumers, while supporting economic growth.” According to the release, the sandbox is designed to offer companies access to improved data, technical expertise and regulatory support to speed up innovation, and is open to any financial services firm that wants to experiment with AI. “AI is fundamentally reshaping the financial sector by automating processes, enhancing data analysis, and improving decision-making, which leads to greater efficiency, accuracy, and risk management across a wide range of financial activities,” said Dr. Jochen Papenbrock, EMEA head of financial technology at Nvidia. “The FCA’s Supercharged Sandbox provides firms with a secure environment to explore AI innovations using NVIDIA’s full stack accelerated computing platform, supporting industry-wide growth and efficiency.” PYMNTS examined the use of AI in the finance world earlier this year in a conversation with John Kain, head of financial services market development at Amazon Web Services (AWS). “AI has been such an integral part of how the industry has modernized over the last decade. It really is in every part of the financial services value chain,” said Kain, a former JPMorgan executive. “What’s dramatically changed in the last two years is the impact of generative AI on all those processes.” In other news from the intersection of AI and financial services, PYMNTS spoke with John Bresnahan, global head of operations at i2c, in an interview posted Monday about that company’s use of the technology for payments and banking functions. “We’ve been building our AI capabilities for over a decade now,” he said. “This isn’t a new phrase for us. We really think of AI as augmented intelligence. We don’t view it as something that takes over human roles but as something that really enhances them.” That approach to viewing AI not as a replacement but as a force multiplier can pave the way for efficiencies through all aspects of operations, including fraud detection, compliance monitoring and customer service analytics. “Our clients aren’t looking for the novelty of AI,” Bresnahan said. “They’re looking for impact.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

But they're also expensive and require immense power at scale, and in some cases, companies seek more targeted, energy or space-efficient solutions.When companies want to diversify away from Nvidia, they often turn to AMD, which also makes a GPU. Mark Papermaster, AMD's CTO, told BI that moving workloads from one GPU to another is always going to be the easiest move, from a technical perspective. And AMD is directing resources toward its software to make this as easy as possible.But some industries are particularly keen to look outside those two contenders.If inference volume is high enough and uniform enough, it makes financial sense to invest in making an alternative chip architecture work for certain workloads, Robert Wachen, cofounder of Etched, one of the newer entrants to the chips space, told BI.\"When you're inferencing, it really matters to find the right processor that matches your use case,\" David Driggers, CEO of Cirrascale Cloud Services, which offers chips from startups Cerebras, SambaNova Systems, as well as Qualcomm, Nvidia, and AMD, told BI.Here are the industries turning to Nvidia alternatives.High-frequency tradingHigh-frequency stock trading, or HFT, is an area where the speed and accuracy of computation is \"mission-critical,\" Rodrigo Liang, CEO of SambaNova Systems, told BI. Firms like Citadel Securities, Susquehanna, and Jane Street can make millions by getting a fraction of a second ahead of market movements.\"The entry point for the new chips is going to come in these higher value use cases first,\" Liang said.HFT firms hire top machine learning talent, often competing directly with frontier companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.Jane Street has thousands of H100 and H200 chips from Nvidia, according to the firm's website. However, the company also participated in Etched's $120 million Series A in 2024. Etched is betting on transformer models, the kind used for chatbots — models specifically suited to its Sohu chip. The company has also raised funds from PayPal founder Peter Thiel and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke, among others.In addition to a need for speed, HFT firms often require at least some of their computations to be completely private.\"For a long time, hedge funds with truly proprietary code, that were truly trade secret strategies, were the last holdouts to cloud,\" Sourcegraph CEO Quinn Slack told BI. On-premises data centers are more likely to have space and energy-related constraints that Nvidia alternatives are looking to seize upon.Targeting and recommendationsSome of the earliest returns on the billions of dollars invested in AI were from within tech giants' social media and e-commerce businesses.\"AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving,\" Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's April earnings call. Using AI to improve recommendations across the platform has led users of Instagram, Threads, and Facebook to spend more time on the apps.\"There are a lot of opportunities also for us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and recommendation work,\" Zuckerberg said.Wachen told BI recommendations workloads are primed for alternatives to Nvidia, especially as ad-targeting becomes custom-generated ads.Ad targeting and content recommendations are also major use cases for the chips that cloud firms have developed themselves. Google's TPU, a chip originally designed in partnership with Broadcom, for instance, is particularly suited for these tasks.Sovereign AISovereign clouds — state-developed data centers built for national security and other purposes, often share some constraints with the financial services sector.Saudi entities have been particularly committed to diversifying their chips. Saudi Aramco, for example, has deals with Cerebras, Groq, SambaNova Systems (as well as AMD and Nvidia).G42, a major Saudi AI data center project, has partnered with Cerebras, AMD, and Nvidia. Humain, the latest entity to emerge from Saudi Arabia's voracious appetite for AI, which was first announced during President Donald Trump's recent visit to the Kingdom, counts Groq, Nvidia, and AMD as partners.Canadian telecom firm Bell Canada just announced Groq as its inference provider. And SambaNova chips are installed in one of SoftBank's data centers in Japan.Up the stackWhen Meta introduced its Llama 4 model, it also launched a first-of-its-kind API — a direct way for developers to access the model from Meta itself, with computing power coming from Cerebras and Groq. Both companies have their own novel chip architectures; they also offer their own inference service alongside selling chips.The inference market is crowded. But setting up their own data centers to provide it as a service, allows chip startups to bring in revenue faster than the much longer process of selling the chips themselves. Still, there are tradeoffs.Hardware choices present both opportunity and risk for companies, said Driggers. Going with an alternative to Nvidia can save on time and money in some cases, but most alternatives are less flexible than a GPU. That the risk of commitment in these early days of AI is what's keeping many companies from buying non-Nvidia chips, he said. In the meantime, startups are contending with a very finicky inference market.\"If our offering is better, customers will stay,\" said Liang. \"If somebody else has a better offering, the market will move.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "A joint research effort by Meta, Google DeepMind, Cornell University, and NVIDIA has pinpointed the hard boundaries of what large language models can truly memorize, measuring it down to the bit and challenging assumptions about how these systems retain information.The study, published this week on arXiv, overturns lingering assumptions about AI’s tendency to memorize swathes of training data. Instead, it reveals that even the most advanced transformer models exhibit a strict upper limit in their memory i.e. around 3.6 bits per parameter, regardless of how much data they’re exposed to. That limit isn't just a technical detail. It touches copyright, privacy, and the future of safe AI deployment. Inside the AI Brain: What's Stored, What's NotUnlike previous studies that chased down memorized training phrases via prompting tricks, this one does something different. Researchers trained GPT-style transformers not on language, but on purely random bitstrings — deliberately designed to have zero patterns. No grammar. No meaning. Just noise. The reason? Noise can’t be generalized. So if a model recalls any of it, it must be pure memorization. No learning. No inference. Just raw storage. When measured this way, memory stops growing after a fixed point — regardless of how much extra noise is added. The findings show that models memorize until they \"fill up\" and then plateau. That cap, across hundreds of tests, consistently hovered at 3.6 bits per parameter. Even when tested under different model depths, widths, and training precisions [like bfloat16 (brain floating point 16-bit) vs. float32 (32-bit floating point)], the result held steady. Higher precision allowed a slight bump — to 3.83 bits — but never came close to doubling capacity, hinting at diminishing returns from simply increasing numeric range. When AI Stops Memorizing and Starts UnderstandingIn real-world applications, LLMs aren’t fed randomness—they’re trained on books, web pages, and human dialogue. That opens the door to generalization: the process by which models extract reusable patterns instead of storing every instance. This study didn’t just quantify memorization. It also mapped how models shift from memorizing examples to abstracting patterns, depending on dataset size. With smaller datasets, models lean heavily on memory. But as the dataset grows, a point arrives where memorization becomes inefficient. That’s when the model begins to generalize. This shift aligns with a well-known but still mysterious machine learning curve called double descent. The paper offers a compelling explanation. Initially, adding more data makes performance worse (as memorization reaches its limits), but beyond a threshold, the model adapts by abstracting structure—and suddenly, performance improves again. Not All Data Is EqualOne nuance the researchers stress is that some types of data are more prone to memorization. Highly unique, stylized, or rare sequences are easier for the model to latch onto. Even if most training points are generalized, edge cases still pose privacy and copyright risks. In experiments using real text (specifically from the deduplicated FineWeb corpus), the models demonstrated a blend of behaviors: partial memorization on rare examples, and generalized pattern learning on common ones. Compression rates—used here as a stand-in for memorization—were more variable on text than on noise. Test and train distributions overlapped more heavily, which means membership inference attacks (attempts to detect if a sample was in training data) are harder to pull off reliably on natural language. Why This Matters: Copyright, Compliance, and ControlThese findings land squarely in the middle of a legal storm. AI companies are facing lawsuits from artists, publishers, and tech firms over claims that their data was copied without consent. This paper, without making legal claims, introduces a quantifiable framework for measuring what a model truly \"remembers.\" It suggests that when trained on massive corpora, models inherently dilute memorization across the data. Bigger datasets mean less per-sample retention—a property that actually reduces the risk of regurgitating protected material. In numbers: A model with 1.5 billion parameters holds about 675 megabytes of raw memory. That's tiny relative to the petabytes of content it's trained on. For any single book, image, or line of code, the chance of exact reproduction—outside of extremely unique cases—is slim. A Predictive Law for Privacy The researchers didn’t stop at observation. They proposed a scaling law that links model size, dataset volume, and the likelihood of successful membership inference. It predicts how easily an attacker could determine whether a data point was in the training set. The verdict? For large models trained on sufficiently large corpora, such attacks approach random guessing—a major reassurance for privacy advocates. Interestingly, this law behaves like a sigmoid: inference is trivial on tiny datasets, but fades to statistical noise as data grows. What Comes NextThis study doesn’t resolve every debate—but it redraws the line between speculation and measurable truth. For developers, it provides a diagnostic tool to estimate how much sensitive information a model might retain. For policymakers, it lays groundwork for new standards in AI accountability. And for the public? It clarifies that today's LLMs are not mindless recorders. They are, increasingly, statistical juggernauts that generalize more than they remember—unless we force them not to.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: ChatGPT Might Know More About You Than You Think — Here’s How to Check and Erase It",

If you don’t follow the twists and turns of graphics card launch metanarratives, allow me to recap the company's behavior for you. Though the RTX 5060 launched on May 19, Nvidia and its partners were uncharacteristically slow to ship graphics cards to reviewers. For outlets that received pre-launch hardware, Nvidia didn’t provide the pre-launch drivers that it usually sends out so that reviewers could run their own tests on the cards, informing reviewers on a call that drivers would be available to them and the public on the 19th. Except! Nvidia did offer advance drivers to a handful of publications on the condition that they run a few benchmarks that had been pre-selected by Nvidia and that they only report numbers from tests performed with the 50-series new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) setting enabled.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The AI-focused partnership will usher in the next generation of industrial robotics. The post How GM + Nvidia are changing the face of the automotive industry appeared first on FreightWaves. General Motors is making significant strides in revolutionizing its manufacturing processes through a new partnership with chipmaker Nvidia. Announced in March, the collaboration aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance automation, cut costs and improve efficiency across GM’s factories. At the heart of this partnership is Nvidia’s advanced computing technology, which GM is leveraging to build custom AI systems for its manufacturing operations. The automaker is using Nvidia Omniverse with Cosmos to create digital twins of its assembly lines, allowing for virtual testing and simulation of production processes before physical implementation. This is JP Hampstead, co-host with Craig Fuller of the Bring It Home podcast. Welcome to the 25th edition of our newsletter, where we go deep into one of the largest-scale tech-industrial partnerships in the automotive industry. “Using digital twins, we simulate a running production line before it’s constructed, optimizing our planning process and allowing us to scale faster while saving time and money,” explained JP Clausen, GM’s executive VP of global manufacturing and sustainability. “It also helps our team members identify and solve problems more effectively.” These digital simulations enable GM to test and refine new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle manufacturing, a critical advantage as the company balances production of both traditional combustion engines and electric vehicles. The partnership extends to training robotics platforms for operations such as material handling, transport and precision welding. Through a combination of AI and machine learning, GM has developed systems that can identify potential issues in manufacturing, such as leaks in battery packs, allowing for quick repairs and supporting quality control. The automotive industry, led by companies like GM, remains the largest user of industrial robots in America. According to Brookings Institute data, nearly half of the 233,305 industrial robots in the United States are employed in auto manufacturing. Michigan, home to GM’s headquarters, accounts for nearly 28,000 robots — approximately 12% of the nation’s total. Detroit, in particular, stands out as the robot capital of America, with more than three times the number of industrial robots compared to other metropolitan areas. By 2015, the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn area had 15,115 industrial robots in place, or 8.5 per 1,000 workers, a significant increase from 5,753 robots in 2010. This high concentration of automation has contributed to a dramatic shift in GM’s workforce composition over decades. In 1979, GM employed 468,000 American hourly workers, representing 76% of its U.S. workforce. By 2021, that number had dropped to just 45,000 American hourly workers, or 46% of the company’s domestic workforce. GM’s innovation hub, the Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, employs approximately 24,000 people with an average annual salary of $120,000. This facility has become central to developing the company’s AI-driven manufacturing technologies. Using both robotics and proprietary AI tools, GM has implemented systems to inspect welds and paint coats, identifying irregularities and anomalies that might affect vehicle quality. This technology not only improves product quality but also enhances workplace safety by automating potentially hazardous tasks. “We’re using AI and advanced software to help our team minimize ergonomic stressors, enable workplace safety and enhance quality in our manufacturing plants,” notes Clausen. “Investing in our current and future workforce with better technology helps ensure that our teams have the skills and tools needed as we continue to evolve our manufacturing footprint to meet customer demand.” GM’s automation advancements come at a critical time as the company navigates challenges in electric vehicle production. In October 2023, GM announced delays in the production of electric trucks, including the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, pushing the start date at its Orion Assembly plant from 2024 to late 2025. The company cited the need to “align its capital investments with electric vehicle demand and implement vehicle engineering improvements to boost profitability” as reasons for the delay. GM’s partnership with Nvidia aims to address these challenges by improving engineering efficiency and manufacturing processes. Engineers collaborate in real time on digital twins of manufacturing robotics using Nvidia’s Omniverse. (Photo: Nvidia) Despite production delays, GM maintains ambitious plans, projecting to have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025 and to convert 50% of its North American assembly capacity to EV production by 2030. While automation raises concerns about job displacement, GM emphasizes that AI is being implemented to enhance, not replace, its workforce. The company describes its approach as “people-centric,” using AI to help employees avoid ergonomic stressors and improve workplace safety. “It’s not about automating everything or building more vehicles faster — our winning formula is driven by a combination of flexible manufacturing, advanced technology, and a talented workforce,” states Clausen. Nevertheless, GM’s transformation from “automaker to platform innovator” suggests a continuing shift toward higher-skilled, technology-focused employment. In its presentation to investors titled “From Automaker to Platform Innovator,” GM projected that software and new business ventures would grow from $2 billion to $80 billion by 2030, indicating a future in which salaried professionals may increasingly outnumber traditional manufacturing workers. The Nvidia partnership positions GM to remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven automotive landscape. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, emphasized the significance of the collaboration: “The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made.” GM plans to build next-generation vehicles on Nvidia DRIVE AGX, based on the Nvidia Blackwell architecture, delivering up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high-performance compute. This technology will not only power manufacturing but also enhance future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin safety features. As automotive manufacturing continues to advance, GM’s strategic investments in AI and robotics may provide a competitive edge. The company has maintained its position as the U.S. sales leader for three consecutive years through 2024, offering what it describes as “the broadest portfolio of electric vehicles in the industry,” with plans to expand to a dozen EV models by the end of 2025. Quotable “The era of physical AI is here.” – Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO Infographic (Image: Fortune Business Insights) News from around the web GlobalFoundries Announces $16B U.S. Investment to Reshore Essential Chip Manufacturing and Accelerate AI Growth GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) (GF), working with the Trump administration and with support from leading technology companies aiming to onshore critical components of their supply chain, has announced plans to invest $16 billion to expand its semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities across its facilities in New York and Vermont. GF’s investment is a strategic response to the explosive growth in artificial intelligence, which is accelerating demand for next-generation semiconductors designed for power efficiency and high-bandwidth performance across data centers, communications infrastructure and AI-enabled devices. Kraft Heinz confirms $3B investment in US manufacturing Kraft Heinz will spend $3 billion on its U.S. manufacturing facilities, the company confirmed to Food Dive. It’s the largest investment in its plants in decades. Pedro Navio, president of Kraft Heinz’s North America operations, told Reuters earlier this month that planned investments could add 3,500 employees to the Lunchables producer’s workforce. Rolls-Royce to invest $24 million in US manufacturing Rolls-Royce has announced a $24 million U.S. investment that will more than double production of backup power generation systems for data centers and create more than 100 new jobs in the U.S. The investment includes a new 250,000ft2 Logistics Operations Centre adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility in Mankato, Minnesota. It will enable Rolls-Royce to increase production capacity for its mtu Series 4000 generator sets, which are in high demand from the rapidly growing data center industry.

        "description": "Nvidia stock has rallied 45% since hitting a low in April, adding $1 trillion in market value in about two months. I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty ImagesNvidia shares are up 20% in a month, reflecting a major rebound for the chipmaker.Shares were down as much as 31% year-to-date through April as tariffs rocked markets.Since April lows, the AI titan has been boosted by fresh catalysts that have revived investors' enthusiasm.Nvidia stock has embarked on a fresh rally thanks to four big catalysts that are generating new enthusiasm for artificial intelligence chip maker.The stock has climbed 20% over the last month. Since its most recent low in April, the move up is even sharper. After bottoming during the broader market sell-off caused by Donald Trump's tariff announcements, the stock is up 45%, a gain of about $1 trillion in market cap. The stock is up about 5% year-to-date.That latest rally follows a rough few months for Nvidia. Shares were down more than 30% year-to-date in early April as concerns swirled around export controls and Trump's tariffs, which complicated the chipmaker's business in China.While the stock has benefited from an easing of tariff-related headwinds that's also boosted the broader market, there are several company-specific forces driving the rally.Here is what's sparked the latest run of gains for the top chip maker.AI diffusion rule rollbackThe Commerce Department did away with the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule in mid-May, removing restrictions on which countries Nvidia can sell AI chips to.Those restrictions have been a major overhang for Nvidia stock this year. At a recent tech conference, Ceo Jensen Huang told reporters that export controls have hurt Nvidia's business in China.\"All in all, the export control was a failure,\" Huang said at the event. \"The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, have been proven to be fundamentally flawed.\"Nvidia's big Saudi dealNvidia announced a major partnership with Humain in May. The AI firm is controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The deal involves Humain purchasing advanced semiconductors from Nvidia to create AI infrastructure in the nation. In the first phase of the project, Nvidia will send 18,000 GB300 Frace Blackwell AI supercomputer chips, the firm said in a statement.That partnership came shortly after Saudi Arabia pledged to invest $600 billion in various US industries, including AI and infrastructure.\"Those 'allies' want to invest here in the USA and also get a hold of a TON of Nvidia chips for domestic AI factories. For Nvidia shareholders, it would seem that this repeal is great news and that the administration is reigniting the 'Sovereign Thesis,'\" analysts at Melius Research wrote in a note last month.Earnings calm jittery investorsNvidia's first-quarter results were once again strong. The chipmaker reported $44.06 billion in revenue, above analysts' estimates of $43.32 billion.Perhaps more importantly, however, Huang soothed investors who have been nervous about the impact of disruptions to business in China.On the earnings call, the company noted that it took a hit from China, but business is still basically booming. Huang slammed export controls, but he affirmed his faith in the Trump administration.\"The president has a plan,\" Huang said to investors. \"He has a vision, and I trust him.\"Deepwater Asset Management said last week that Huang's comment suggests that the chipmaker could be in a favorable position as trade negotiations between the US and China continue.\"My best guess is Nvidia will be part of a broader trade agreement with China,\" analysts from the firm wrote.No slowdown in enterprise AI spendingThe AI hyperscalers like Meta Platforms and Microsoft don't appear to be pulling back on AI spending.Tech titans like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon have pledged to spend more than $300 billion this year on AI-related capex. Apple, meanwhile, has said it would spend $500 billion over the next four years.\"Q1 earnings from mega-cap tech companies have also reinforced AI investment visibility, with customers maintaining or increasing their 2025 capex plans,\" Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note, adding that he believed Nvidia's growth in data centers would run on for at least the next two years.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Amusement park companies are using technology to streamline operations and build new rides.United Parks & ResortsTheme park companies are leveraging technology to transform the guest experience.Legoland uses AI to track ride attendance and manage lines.Disney is partnering with Nvidia and Google DeepMind to bring AI-powered robots to its parks.It is a truth universally acknowledged: Lines are the worst part of amusement parks.Sure, too many $8 pretzels can gut your budget, but there's something uniquely taxing about waiting in line for a popular ride on a sticky summer day.There might be a fix, however: artificial intelligence. New technology of all kinds is transforming the theme park experience in the United States, helping drive growth in the industry.Among the theme parks leveraging new technology is Legoland.\"We're using a technology called Vision AI,\" Adrian Thompson, operations transformation director for Legoland's parent company, Merlin Entertainments, told Business Insider. \"We have cameras placed over our attractions that analyze the number of people physically riding those attractions at any given time. It doesn't identify you uniquely, but it identifies the number of people riding an attraction.\"Legoland uses AI to gather information about guest attendance and ride operations.Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesThompson said incorporating AI into attraction line areas allows ride managers to receive data in real time, mitigating potential issues or delays.\"If they see anomalies in that data — the number of dispatches has reduced or the queue times have gone up — they can take action at that moment and make changes,\" Thompson said. \"Before, when it was all paper-based, we didn't have access to all that data in real time. You might not have gotten that information until the end of the day, at which point it's too late to impact the guest experience.\"New tech brings the Arctic to FloridaAbout 40 miles north of Legoland is SeaWorld, where Expedition Odyssey opened to the public last month. Expedition Odyssey is an immersive flying theater ride that transports guests to the Arctic using real footage of the icy landscapes and wildlife.\"There's no CGI in it,\" Conner Carr, the vice president of rides and engineering for SeaWorld and Busch Gardens' parent company, United Parks & Resorts, told BI. \"The standard on those ride types has always been to generate with animation or CGI effects for a ride film.\"Expedition Odyssey opened at SeaWorld this month in Florida.United Parks & ResortsInstead, SeaWorld sent teams equipped with custom-lensed cameras and drones on expeditions to the Arctic to capture the videos.\"For us, it's not just a theme park experience. It's that zoological aspect, too,\" Carr said. \"We don't want to sit in an office and draw a beluga whale. We want to show them a real one.\"Although the authentic footage helps set Expedition Odyssey apart from its peers, Carr said there's another reason he refers to it as the \"most technologically advanced ride\" SeaWorld has ever done.A typical flying theater involves guests entering their seats, enjoying the show, and exiting before another group can enter. Expedition Odyssey uses a rotating main tower that allows guests to load the ride while another is already watching the footage. Once the ride is done, the tower will essentially flip, and the groups will switch places.\"This lets us keep the line moving and procedures like you would see on a coaster, but on a completely new type of ride that typically doesn't allow that,\" Carr said.Expedition Odyssey is a flying theatre ride at SeaWorld in Florida.United Parks & ResortCarr said another way guests interact with new technology at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens theme parks is by including audio and visual aspects in the line.\"That's what Penguin Trek does,\" Carr said, referring to a roller coaster at the Orlando park. \"When you dispatch on the ride, you have special effects and lights that make you feel like you're in an ice cave that's falling.\"That technology is also found at Busch Gardens, where guests can ride the Phoenix Rising roller coaster, which utilizes media screens, lights, and onboard audio.Augmented reality and Lego FerrarisAt SeaWorld, Carr said 3D scanning has become a reliable tool for repairs and creating models.\"It is not just roller coaster track replacement. We use 3D scanning all over the place,\" Carr said. \"The technology has been amazing for new projects like Penguin Trek and Expedition Odyssey.\"Augmented reality is another type of technology becoming more prevalent at amusement parks, including Legoland California and Legoland Florida.The Lego Ferrari Build & Race attraction allows guests to build and test cars, then use augmented reality to scan and race them virtually. Hands-on activities are a priority for Legoland theme parks, where the Ninjago ride uses hand-tracking movements that let riders use hand gestures to test their skills.The Lego Ferrari Build & Race attraction found at some Legoland parks.Legoland/Merlin Entertainments\"The beauty for us is we're always going to do hands-on experiences because it's Lego,\" Thompson said.Carr said SeaWorld and Busch Gardens have a similar approach, given their animal conservation efforts. \"The mission is to inspire and educate right alongside rescuing all the animals,\" he said.Other theme parks in the United States are also flexing their tech acumen, including Disney, which partnered with Nvidia and Google DeepMind to develop Newton. The open-source physics engine will help robots learn to navigate tasks more accurately.Disney intends to use the technology to enhance the robotic characters in its theme parks to be more lifelike.\"This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before—and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can,\" Kyle Laughlin, the senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering's Research and Development, said in a press release.Theme parks are navigating tariffsAlthough the attractions industry continues to entice guests from around the globe, the volatility caused by the Trump administration's tariffs has become an unpredictable obstacle.\"New tariffs will make securing product — like games, plush, and merchandise made outside the United States — more expensive to import. Ahead of the rate hikes, some operators created additional storage space and took possession of goods earlier in the season than what they have imported in the past to avoid paying the tariffs,\" the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions said this month.The association said the tariffs have also strained the US relationship with Canada, potentially affecting theme park attendance this summer.\"Also of concern for several American facilities: a softening in the zest to travel south by Canadians who are accustomed to spending their summers in the United States. The current political climate between the two nations may adversely affect the sentiment to travel in the months ahead,\" the IAAPA said.However, the uncertainty hasn't stopped companies from steamrolling ahead with ambitious projects. Universal's newest theme park, Epic Universe, opened to fanfare this month in Florida, while Disney announced plans to develop its seventh theme park in Abu Dhabi.Read the original article on Business Insider Amusement park companies are using technology to streamline operations and build new rides.United Parks & ResortsTheme park companies are leveraging technology to transform the guest experience.Legoland uses AI to track ride attendance and manage lines.Disney is partnering with Nvidia and Google DeepMind to bring AI-powered robots to its parks.It is a truth universally acknowledged: Lines are the worst part of amusement parks.Sure, too many $8 pretzels can gut your budget, but there's something uniquely taxing about waiting in line for a popular ride on a sticky summer day.There might be a fix, however: artificial intelligence.

This week in artificial intelligence, newsmakers include Google, Claude, Microsoft, Nvidia and Saudi Arabia. Brands Must Lean Into AI Chatbots as Google Search Changes AI chatbots are transforming how search works, making traditional SEO tactics less effective. “It is fundamentally changing the search engine optimization (SEO) universe,” Local Falcon CEO David Hunter told PYMNTS in an interview. “It’s not just a little algorithm update… The concept of being visible in a search engine is changing dramatically.” In the past, businesses relied on keyword-rich pages and inbound links to rank. Now, Google’s large language models deliver results based on conversational context and user intent. Local Falcon’s research highlighted a change in how Google decides which businesses appear — and in what order — in search results. Anthropic’s Claude Gets Conversational Voice Anthropic’s Claude now lets users converse through voice, not just text, following in the footsteps of ChatGPT and Gemini. But unlike ChatGPT, Claude’s voice integrates with Google Workspace to access Calendar, Gmail and Docs. This lets Claude audibly tell users about upcoming meetings, emails and relevant news. The Workspace integration is for paid subscribers, with Docs accessibility for Enterprise plan users only. Gemini’s voice also offers integration with Workspace. Voice mode is available in English on Claude mobile apps. For free users, Claude has a daily limit of 20 to 30 voice messages. Paid plans have higher limits depending on the type of plan. Microsoft Offers AI Agent Marketplace for Business Microsoft launched the Agent Store, a marketplace where users can shop for AI agents tailored to specific tasks. “The Agent Store is your one-stop shop for the next generation of AI assistants,” wrote Principal Product Manager Siffat Hingorani and Senior Product Manager Olive Hu in a blog post. Integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, the store lets users “browse, install and try agents” from Microsoft, partners and customers. Unlike OpenAI’s GPT marketplace, Microsoft’s agents are embedded within the user’s work environment, with the user’s data as context. The store opened with over 70 agents, and developers can build and publish using Copilot Studio and the 365 Agents Toolkit. Nvidia Takes $4.5 Billion Charge for Chinese Chips Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an earnings call with analysts that the company took a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to excess inventory of the H20 chip that was specifically designed for China. However, a new rule required a license before the chip could be sold in the Chinese market. “We cannot further reduce the chip’s performance to stay within the regulations, so it is inventory we cannot sell or repurpose,” Huang said. Despite the China setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. It also beat Wall Street’s expectations for first-quarter earnings and revenue. Saudi Arabia Vies to Be Middle East’s AI Center Saudi Arabia’s new AI company, Humain, plans to launch a $10 billion venture fund targeting startups across the United States, Europe and Asia. It also seeks investments from top U.S. tech companies. CEO Tareq Amin told the Financial Times: “We are in discussions with all of them,” referring to talks with OpenAI, xAI and Andreessen Horowitz. “Some of them, which you will hear about very soon, are massive names in the data center segment.” Humain aims to build 1.9 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2030 and expand to 6.6 gigawatts by 2034. Amin said this would require a $77 billion investment. “The world is hungry for capacity,” Amin said. “There are two paths you could take. You take it slow, and we are definitely not taking it slow, or you go fast. Whoever reaches the end line first, I think, is going to secure a good chunk of the market share.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

The president told Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell he’s making a mistake for not cutting rates. The S&P 500 pared most of an advance that earlier approached 1%. A federal appeals court offered Trump a temporary reprieve from a ruling threatening to throw out the bulk of his tariff agenda. Treasuries rose on bets the Fed will slash rates twice this year and after a solid $44 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar fell. The US economy shrank at the start of the year, restrained by weaker consumer spending and an even bigger impact from trade than initially reported. Pending sales of previously owned homes last month fell by the most since September 2022, while a rise in recurring jobless claims signaled higher unemployment. (Source: Bloomberg)",

APStocks gained on Thursday after a court blocked President Donald Trump's tariffs.The court is giving the Trump administration 10 days to comply with its order.Stocks also got a boost from Nvidia's first-quarter earnings beat. US stocks climbed on Thursday after a federal trade court gave said President Donald Trump didn't have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs on imports. Major indexes were higher, with the Nasdaq 100 climbing more than 1% as traders digested Nvidia's first-quarter earnings.Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:S&P 500: 5,927.65, up 0.7%Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,154.37, up 0.13% (+55.67 points)Nasdaq composite: 19,316.61, up 1.13%In a ruling late Wednesday, the US Court of International Trade found that Trump did not have the power to impose tariffs on many of the US's trading partners. The ruling said it would give the Trump administration 10 days to comply with its order.\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, told Business Insider in an email.Investors have been antsy all year about the potential impact of tariffs, which economists have said will raise costs for businesses that can be passed along to consumers.Tariffs could also weigh on economic growth and keep interest rates elevated, as the Federal Reserve will be hesitant to lower borrowing costs to avoid stoking more upward price pressure. Analysts say that uncertainty is still hanging over the market, despite the boost in sentiment.\"Yet the uncertainty premium remains very much alive. Every forthcoming court milestone carries the potential for fresh headlines,\" Ahmad Assiri, a research strategist at Pepperstone, wrote in a note on Thursday, pointing to anxieties over the growing US budget deficit.\"This after-hours rally reflected a swift change in sentiment as traders welcomed the prospect of reduced trade headwinds,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note. \"But investors should take care. Markets are extremely skittish at present and capable of big moves in both directions, as demonstrated by the overnight rally. This is not the slow and steady bull market that took off in October 2022.\"Trump has incrementally scaled back the majority of his proposed tariffs, a move that the market has coined as the \"TACO trade\" in recent days. Many of the tariffs he announced on April 2 have been reduced to 10% for a 90-day period as trade negotiations take place. Tariffs on China have also been reduced to 30% on a separate 90-day timeline. A 50% tariff on the EU has been pushed out to July 9, which is when the pause on most of the Liberation Day tariffs expire.Tech stocks were also on a tear on Thursday as traders took in Nvidia's latest quarterly earnings report. The chipmaker reported $44.06 billion in revenue, beating estimates. CEO Jensen Huang also soothed investors about the impact of restrictions on its business in China.Nvidia shares rose about 6% to trade at $143.31. Other chipmakers also moved higher, with Advanced Micro Devices up 2% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company up 1%. Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Stock markets are moving higher in premarket trading on Thursday as of the time of this writing. Two groups of stocks are doing particularly well: Big Tech’s Magnificent Seven and major chipmaker stocks. Shares in one stock that crosses over into both groups—Nvidia Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA)—are currently up 6% in premarket trading. But NVDA isn’t the only chip and tech stock that is up. Other major technology companies like Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), and Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO) are also trending significantly higher. Why are Big Tech and chipmaker stocks surging this morning? It comes down to three pieces of news. Here’s what you need to know. Markets and Big Tech jump on Trump tariff court ruling As of the time of this writing, market futures are trending higher this morning. S&P Futures are currently up 1.1%, Dow Futures are up 0.56%, and Nasdaq Futures are up 1.6%. The main reason for this broad surge in futures is a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of International Trade on Wednesday that declared President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs illegal. As CNBC notes, the three-judge panel ruled that the mechanism Trump used to invoke the tariffs without Congressional approval—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—doesn’t grant the president the authority to impose universal tariffs. The judges declared that “the Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,” and ordered not only a permanent halt to the tariffs but future modification to them as well. As Fast Company previously reported, multiple states and small businesses sued over the implementation of the tariffs. The judges also ruled against the Trump administration’s implementation of tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China based on the importation of fentanyl into the United States, saying those separate tariffs “fail because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders.” Not all of Trump’s tariffs have been ruled unlawful. The president’s tariffs on aluminum and steel can remain because they were not implemented under the IEEPA. The Court of International Trade gave the Trump administration 10 days to put a halt to the tariffs ruled illegal, but the Trump administration has already appealed the ruling, which may very likely end up before the Supreme Court. While the tariff situation is likely to continue to play out in the courts in the weeks ahead, news of the ruling has lifted futures—and Big Tech stocks. The companies that make up Big Tech’s Magnificent Seven—Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—faced particular challenges from the tariffs since many of their products are sourced from China, the country that received the highest tariffs. If not directly sourcing their products from China, they still rely on supplies or components from the country, such as servers, that the tariffs have threatened to make acquiring more expensive. Here’s how Big Tech’s Magnificent Seven stocks are currently trading based on the news: Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG): up 1.29% Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN): up 2.5% Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL): up 2.4% Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META): up 1.4% Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT): up 0.8% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): up 6% Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA): up 2.49% Elon Musk’s time in the Trump administration “comes to an end” One of the Magnificent Seven stocks—Tesla—is certainly getting a boost from the ruling against Trump’s tariffs, but there’s likely another reason why the stock is trending higher today, too. That reason is Elon Musk. On Wednesday, the CEO took to his social media platform X to announce that his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk wrote, adding, “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Musk joined the administration in January to head the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But his work with the administration and DOGE has cost his most well-known company, Tesla, dearly. Musk’s involvement in politics has alienated many of the carmaker’s fans across the globe, leading to plummeting Tesla sales in many key markets, including those in Europe and the United States. News that he is leaving DOGE and the Trump administration is something Tesla investors have been waiting to hear for a long time—and it’s contributing to TSLA stock moving higher this morning. Nvidia’s earnings lift chip stocks Finally, while many chipmaker stocks are also getting a lift today due to the Trump tariff ruling news, chipmaker and chipmaker-adjacent stocks, including chip machine maker ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML), are also seeing a boost thanks to Nvidia’s Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings results, which the company announced yesterday. Nvidia reported revenue of $44.1 billion, which was up 12% from the previous quarter and 69% from the same quarter a year earlier. It also reported data center revenue of $39.1 billion, a 10% rise from the previous quarter and a 73% rise from the same quarter a year ago. As CNBC notes, the better-than-expected earnings results have sent NVIDIA Corporation shares higher. Currently, they are up 6%. But since Nvidia is often seen as a bellwether for other chipmakers and chipmaker-adjacent stocks, companies operating in those spaces are also seeing their shares rise this morning on Nvidia’s news. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD): up 2.9% Arm Holdings plc (Nasdaq: ARM): up 3% ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML): up 1.6% Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO): up 2.9% Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC): up 1.28% Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU): up 2.4% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): up 6% QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM): up 1.69% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): up 1.1% Moreover, as Nvidia’s technology has been playing a key role in powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, its earnings beat was seen as a sign that demand for AI remains strong. All in all, it’s looking like a positive start to the morning in the markets, especially for stocks that operate in the Big Tech and chipmaker sectors.",

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang repeatedly criticized the US export controls on chips against China during the company's Q1 earnings call.Artur Widak/NurPhotoNvidia's revenue for Q1 beat Wall Street's expectations despite China restrictions.CEO Jensen Huang provided sobering remarks on the impacts of losing the Chinese market.Huang, however, maintained high praise for some of President Donald Trump's policies.The moment Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had the floor during the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, the executive knew there was one thing on everyone's mind: China.The question of the day for Nvidia's earnings was how big of a hit would the chipmaker take as a result of the Trump administration's export restrictions on H20 chips.The short was that it's big, but not big enough to shake Wall Street's confidence in Nvidia's position as an AI juggernaut.Nvidia reported $44.06 billion in revenue for the quarter despite losing one of its biggest customers in the East, beating Wall Street's revenue expectation of $43.32 billion. Nvidia's stock was up nearly 5% after trading hours.The restrictions still had a sizable impact. Nvidia said the move resulted in a $4.5 billion write-down, and the company anticipates a $8 billion revenue loss for the next quarter.Huang immediately jumpstarted his remarks on Wednesday with sobering thoughts on the restrictions. The CEO said that the export controls on the H20 chip have essentially cut off one of the few ways the company can compete in the country.\"On export control, China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success. With half of the world's AI researchers based there, the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally,\" Huang said. \"Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.\"While Huang repeatedly criticized the export controls, the CEO appeared to only have praise for President Donald Trump during the earnings call, and his brief media blitz afterward on CNBC and Bloomberg.\"The president has a plan,\" Huang said of Trump. \"He has a vision, and I trust him.\"Here are 3 takeaways on Nvidia's China challenge based on Wednesday's earnings call:Nvidia took a hit on China, but business is still boomingNvidia's revenue took a hit due to the loss of business in China, but its core segments, including data centers, remained strong, leaving analysts with a bullish outlook for the company.The company reported $39.1 billion in revenue in its data centers segment for the first quarter, a 73% year-over-year increase.\"Even if they've taken a hit from the recent tariffs and their inability ship certain units to China, you could still see their trajectory is going upwards,\" Gadjo Sevilla, senior AI analyst for EMARKETER, told Business Insider.Still, Huang does not like the China restrictionsHuang was upfront about the impacts the export controls will have not just on Nvidia but also the US's standing in the global AI race.\"Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals,\" Huang said.During a post-earnings call interview on Bloomberg TV, the CEO was asked how Nvidia managed to make up for the losses of China's business. Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow asked if it was partly due to the increasing demand of Nvidia's Blackwell chip system.\"Yeah, I guess so,\" Huang said. \"But you know, you just can't underestimate the importance of the China market. This is the second-largest AI market. This is the home of the world's largest population of AI researchers. And we want all of the world's AI researchers and all of the world's developers to be building on American stacks.\"The CEO said in the interview that, \"irrespective of the near-term revenue success,\" Nvidia can't ignore the significance of the Chinese market.The CEO will still play nice with TrumpHuang was careful to keep his criticisms on the US export controls on China contained to just that — a criticism of the export controls.Shortly after Huang said that the export restrictions have essentially locked Nvidia out of the Chinese market, the CEO began to praise Trump's \"bold vision to re-shore advanced manufacturing, create jobs, and strengthen national security.\"Huang also celebrated the US's deal with Saudi Arabia for a $600 billion AI infrastructure project and the Trump administration's move to remove a Biden-era policy known as the \"AI Diffusion Rule\" which placed export limits on US chips. \"President Trump wants US tech to lead,\" Huang said during the call. \"The deals he announced are wins for America, creating jobs, advancing infrastructure, generating tax revenue, and reducing the US trade deficit.\"Beyond ChinaWhile Nvidia's business in China remains in limbo, Huang hinted at his company's plans to explore other horizons, talking about the importance for nations to build \"sovereign AI\" and his plans to tour Europe.\"With respect to further announcements, I'm gonna be on the road next week through Europe,\" Huang said. \"Just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure.\"The CEO said during an interview with Bloomberg TV that he'll be meeting with many \"heads of states\" in the near future.Sevilla, the senior AI analyst for EMARKETER, told BI that Huang's move to explore other countries is \"smart.\"\"That's diversification,\" Sevilla said. \"The only thing you need to consider is that that's going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang repeatedly criticized the US export controls on chips against China during the company's Q1 earnings call.Artur Widak/NurPhotoNvidia's revenue for Q1 beat Wall Street's expectations despite China restrictions.CEO Jensen Huang provided sobering remarks on the impacts of losing the Chinese market.Huang, however, maintained high praise for some of President Donald Trump's policies.The moment Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had the floor during the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, the executive knew there was one thing on everyone's mind: China.The question of the day for Nvidia's earnings was how big of a hit would the chipmaker take as a result of the Trump administration's export restrictions on H20 chips.The short was that it's big, but not big enough to shake Wall Street's confidence in Nvidia's position as an AI juggernaut.Nvidia reported $44.06 billion in revenue for the quarter despite losing one of its biggest customers in the East, beating Wall Street's revenue expectation of $43.32 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts Wednesday (May 28) that recent U.S. export-control changes are reshaping the company’s growth plans in China even as global demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure accelerates. The new rules require U.S. chipmakers to secure licenses before shipping certain advanced devices to China. Huang said the restrictions effectively remove a market he values at roughly $50 billion and have forced Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion inventory charge on its H20 processor, a version of its flagship AI chip designed to meet earlier compliance thresholds. “We cannot further reduce the chip’s performance to stay within the regulations, so it is inventory we cannot sell or repurpose,” he said. While acknowledging that Chinese firms will continue building AI capabilities, Huang framed the policy debate in competitive rather than political terms: “Export-control decisions should strengthen U.S. technology platforms,” he said, adding that the company remains engaged with policymakers and customers to find compliant paths forward. But new U.S. export controls have effectively “closed” the $50 billion Chinese market to American companies, Huang said. Nvidia took a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory on the H20 chip, which was made specifically for the Chinese market under Biden’s export rules.

As a result, we are taking a multibillion-dollar write-off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed,” he said. Despite the China setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. Its projects globally include: A 500MW AI infrastructure initiative in Saudi Arabia with Humain. Stargate UAE to develop an AI infrastructure cluster in Abu Dhabi in partnership with G42, OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and Cisco. AI supercomputer in Taiwan in collaboration with the Taiwanese government and Foxconn. Opened a research center in Japan to host the world’s largest quantum research supercomputer. TSMC is building six fabrication plans and two advanced packaging plants in Arizona to make Nvidia chips. Partnering with Foxconn to construct a 1 million-square-foot facility for AI supercomputers. Huang said Nvidia’s goal is to have chips and systems “built in America within a year,” citing investments to bring back advanced manufacturing.

This refers to AI workloads in which new data is applied to trained models to generate outputs. With reasoning models, where AI agents think back and forth while accessing tools and doing other tasks, the number of tokens (or word clusters) they generate is exploding. More tokens means more compute power is needed, which is where Nvidia’s chips come in. “The number of tokens reasoning goes through is 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot,” Huang said. Other areas of growth include enterprise and industry AI. With enterprise AI, Huang said Nvidia will bring its AI infrastructure to companies, most of whom still keep their data on premises at their own data centers instead of the cloud. Nvidia has put together a compute, storage and networking solution and is getting ready to go to market with it. For industrial AI, Huang said Nvidia offers advancements in robotics, omniverse and working to embed AI into manufacturing operations. According to recent research note from Bank of America Global Research shared with PYMNTS, Nvidia is expanding its portfolio, with a broad set of AI products across cloud, enterprise, humanoid robots, workstation, gaming, software libraries, quantum and 6G. This is what underpins what the chipmaker has called the “multitrillion-dollar AI factory” industry, analysts said.

Revenue rose 69% to $44.06 billion, up from $26.04 billion year over year. Data center revenue was up 73% to $39.1 billion in the quarter from a year ago. The company said AI inference workloads has taken off, soaring tenfold in one year. The earnings results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations of net income of $18.2 billion in the first quarter on revenue of $43.3 billion. Shares of Nvidia rose by 6% to $143.03 in after-hours trading. “Nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and the internet,” Huang said. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI. Nvidia is ready.” Read more: Oracle to Buy $40 Billion Worth of Nvidia Chips for First Stargate Data Center The post Nvidia Takes $4.5B Inventory Charge Due to Chip Trade Policy appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia CorpDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNvidia will release its first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.Shares of the tech giant were up 0.9% year-to-date through Tuesday.There are concerns around how tariffs will impact the business, but Wall Street is still optimistic.Nvidia will report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell.The impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Nvidia will be in focus, as will the company's shrinking market share in China. The overall outlook for Nvidia earnings on Wall Street is generally upbeat, but uncertainty looms in the second half of 2025.The earnings-release time is shortly after 4 p.m. ET, and its conference call with analysts will start around 5 p.m.Nvidia's stock was up 0.9% year-to-date through Tuesdays's close, slightly outpacing the S&P 500's 0.7% increase.Bank of America says guidance could be \"messy\" Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty ImagesNvidia should post a \"modest\" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be \"messy. \" They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China.The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate.BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus.\"Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year,\" analysts wrote.The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.Nvidia's consensus first-quarter revenue estimate is $43.32 billion.First quarterRevenue estimate: $43.32 billionData center revenue estimate: $39.36 billionCompute revenue estimate: $35.47 billionNetworking revenue estimate: $3.45 billionGaming revenue estimate: $2.85 billionProfessional Visualization revenue estimate: $505.8 millionAutomotive revenue estimate: $584.2 millionAdjusted gross margin estimate: 71.1%R&D expenses estimate: $4.06 billionAdjusted operating expenses estimate: $3.63 billionAdjusted operating income estimate: $25.66 billionAdjusted EPS estimate: 88cCapital expenditure estimate: $888.2 millionSecond quarterRevenue estimate: $46.37 billionAdjusted gross margin estimate: 72%Adjusted operating expenses estimate: $3.86 billionCapital expenditure estimate: $913.9 millionFull year 2026Revenue estimate: $200.56 billionCapital expenditure estimate: $3.82 billionRead the original article on Business Insider",

Which raises the question: Why should tariffs be any different?3 things in marketsd3sign/Getty Images1. Goldman Sachs thinks tariff-induced inflation could be a one-time thing. Companies are raising prices amid tariff news, but Goldman thinks an inflation blip is only fleeting, the bank said in a note. Here are its three reasons.2. BlackRock's bond chief weighs in on the market swings. Rick Rieder spoke to BI about the investing opportunities that have arisen in the bond market during a wild few months. Among his favorite current bets is short-duration Treasurys. \"One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static,\" Rieder told BI.3. Trump Media stock swings on plans to raise $2.5 billion for crypto. The stock surged 15% in premarket trading before tumbling as much as 12% on Tuesday. The company's announcement is President Trump's latest move into crypto.3 things in techSam Barnes/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images1. General Catalyst is not like the other VCs. Under Hemant Taneja, GC has acquired stakes in unusual venture-capital assets like hospitals and accounting firms. Taneja is pushing the firm beyond the typical VC playbook, laying the groundwork to go public and baffling the rest of the industry in the process.2. For tech CEOs, it's win-some/lose-some with Trump. Tech billionaires from Jeff Bezos to Mark Zuckerberg lined up to support Trump at his inauguration. For their time and money, Trump is helping them on some things, but fighting them on others.3. Europe's EV boom is leaving Tesla behind. Tesla's European sales collapsed by 49% last month, even as the overall EV market in Europe grew by nearly 28% in the same period, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association shows.3 things in businessAyesha Kazim for BI1. The Gen Zers feeling stuck in sex work. For some graduates, sex work was a shortcut to financial freedom in the face of a brutal job market. But now that their clients are pinching pennies, sex workers are making far less than they used to — and some don't see a way out.2. What really happened at an \"anti-woke\" crypto conference? Solana's Accelerate conference took a strong position on the culture war in a trailer for the event. The vibe of the actual conference was much different, though. It also lacked the spectacle of past crypto conferences. That's probably a good thing, BI's Katie Notopoulos writes.3. Trump wants to make it easier to dump government employees. The administration revived a push to reclassify federal workers as at-will employees, making it much easier to fire them with little to no notice. Critics say it could undermine apolitical government jobs and face legal challenges.In other newsDOGE's '5 things' emails are dying a slow, quiet death.You need a 'resentment audit' to help set healthy boundaries at work, says this executive coach.No, AOC is not worth millions of dollars.Read the memos The Washington Post sent staff offering voluntary buyouts as the Bezos-owned paper restructures.Elon Musk says Trump's spending bill 'undermines' DOGE's work.Google CEO reacts to OpenAI's big hire: 'Jony Ive is one of a kind.'AI hallucinations in court documents are a growing problem, and lawyers are responsible for many of them.Trump says it would cost Canada $61 billion to get protection from his 'Golden Dome.'What's happening todayVice President JD Vance speaks at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas.Macy's reports earnings.Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes published.The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

        "description": "Nvidia’s earnings have become some of the most closely watched numbers on Wall Street. The company makes up about 6.5% of the Nasdaq 100, and 5.5% of the S&P 500, so a good quarter can send the Nasdaq index soaring. A marginal or poor one can send it tumbling. On Wednesday May 28, after the market close, the innovative chip giant will report its fiscal first quarter results for 2025 and expectations are once again high. Analysts expect Q1 revenue to grow 66% year over year to $43.28 billion, according to LSEG. That’s not the 262% increase it had in Q1 of last year, but it’s still an impressive advance. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.73 per share. Nvidia stock (Nasdaq: NVDA) is already on the rise in advance of earnings, gaining more than 3% as of 3:00 p.m. ET, with shares topping $135. Year to date, shares of NVDA are down 2%. Despite the high hopes, though, Nvidia is facing some substantial obstacles – and investors will be looking to see what sort of impact those will have. Last month, the Trump administration put export limits on Nvidia’s H20 chip. That led the company to announce a Q2 write-down of $5.5 billion, related to inventory and purchase commitments for the chip. The longer-term impact of those restrictions could be worse. David O’Connor, of BNP Paribas, wrote in a note Tuesday “This inventory write-off implies a $15 billion H20 revenue hit on a rolling 12-month basis.” The limitations on sales to China could wreak some havoc in the near-term for Nvidia. Bank of America analysts warned that guidance for the second quarter could be “messy,” saying “[Nvidia] could guide [second fiscal quarter revenue] to as low as $41 billion, below recently lowered ~$46 billion consensus.” Earnings per share consensus (an average of analyst expectations) could be lowered significantly as well in the second fiscal quarter. While the short term could be rocky, analysts are more interested in the back half of the year – and will be listening to what the company has to say about the third and fourth quarters. Nvidia is reportedly working on a new chipset for China which would be compliant with the most recent regulations. And big contracts beyond China could potentially help make up any near-term shortfall. A Saudi savior Analysts have remained positive in advance of earnings. Piper Sandler, on Tuesday, reiterated its “overweight” rating on the company (meaning a belief that NVDA stock will outperform its peers or the market over the next 6 to 12 months), saying in a note, “We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year.” And despite its warning, Bank of America maintained its “buy” rating and price target for Nvidia. It raised that target from $150 to $160 last week following the announcement of a deal with Humain, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund that is building a massive AI data center. (This deal seems less likely to face restrictions as the Trump administration has given its blessing to the arrangement, with AI czar David Sacks calling it a “game-changer in the global AI race.”) Nvidia is set to receive an estimated $7 billion in direct contracts from that deal. Phase 1 includes 18,000 Blackwell GPUs valued at roughly $700 million. Bank of America expects “several hundred thousand of NVIDIA’s most advanced GPUs” to be shipped over the next five years. Collectively, 87% of the analysts who cover NVDA stock have a buy rating on the company. The share price has increased more than 600% in the past three years, and the company is the second largest public company in the world by market cap (behind Microsoft) with $3.3 trillion. There are some bears, though. Michael Burry, who rose to prominence by predicting the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, has purchased put options on the company, essentially betting against it. And other critics question how much longer the robust growth can continue, as competitors, such as Huawei, attract clients and cloud companies, like Microsoft and Google, work to create their own AI chips.",

        "description": "While many analysts still count Nvidia as a top tech pick, they're also cautious on overhangs related to China restrictions and tariffs. I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty ImagesNvidia will deliver its first-quarter earnings report after the closing bell on Wednesday. Wall Street is upbeat on the premier AI chip maker, but is cautious on guidance.Analysts see a potential hit from tariffs, with activity in China in focus for analysts. Investors are gearing up for Nvidia to report earnings for the first quarter this week, with questions hanging over the chip maker related to the impact of tariffs and its business in China.The Jensen Huang-led firm will report financial results for the first three months of the year after the closing bell on Wednesday. Analysts expect the chip giant to report $43.2 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.75The outlook for Nvidia's earnings on Wall Street is generally upbeat while uncertainty is brewing for the latter part of this year, particularly as tariffs and trade policy restrictions hang in the balance. Nvidia recently warned of a $5.5 billion hit from trade restrictions after the Trump administration banned sales of its H20 chip in the nation. At a recent news conference in Taiwan, CEO Jensen Huang said the company's market share in China was around 50%, down from 95% four years ago.Here's what analysts see ahead for the mega-cap tech firm:Bank of AmericaNvidia should post a \"modest\" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the guidance for the second quarter could be \"messy. \" They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China.The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate.Nvidia could also lower its guidance on returns related to its partnership with GM, analysts said. They also pointed to the firm's recent $5.5 billion hit from export controls. Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could come in around 6% below consensus, while earnings could come in around 10% below consensus, BofA estimated.\"Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year,\" analysts wrote.The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 18% upside from current levels.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley said it is eyeing challenges ahead for Nvidia, though the company remains its \"top pick\" in the semiconductor industry.Analysts recently cut their estimates after Nvidia was banned from selling its H20 chips in China. The restrictions will likely hold back revenues for the quarter, even as Nvidia saw \"significant improvements\" in shipments for its GB200 chip in April, the bank wrote in a recent note.\"With all that said, we would continue to keep near term expectations in check,\" analysts wrote.The bank has an\"overweight\" rating on the stock and a $160 price target, implying 18% upside from current levels.Piper SandlerPiper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China.\"All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week,\" analysts wrote.Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop.Nvidia's recent deal with a Saudi Arabian tech firm could also provide a tailwind in the second half, analysts said.\"We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year.\"The firm reiterated its \"overweight\" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels.DA DavidsonRestrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an \"overhang\" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come \"any day,\" they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule.\"Core Hyperscalers\" — firms like Microsoft and Amazon that make up nearly half of Nvidia's business — also look like they're starting to stabilize their demand for Nvidia products.Demand from Nvidia's other customers, like neocloud firms, looks like it could hinge on debt dynamics at the individual companies, as well as new regulations imposed on chip sales in China.The firm reiterated its \"neutral\" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from the current levels.Melius ResearchWhile earnings for Nvidia should be \"fine\" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated.\"With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China,\" the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products looks like it will remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal.\"Given speculation of a US/China trade deal and news that Nvidia expects to re-enter this $50B+ market with a less performant chip, it likely only gets better from here,\" analysts wrote in a note. \"While the near-term brings uncertainties, we are confident that we will have more clarity on rules soon,\" they added.The research firm reiterated its \"buy\" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels.CFRA ResearchAngelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had \"considerably improved\" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China.Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company \"strategic importance\" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients.Mega-cap tech firms also look poised to keep spending on AI. Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants have said they would increase their capital expenditures in 2025, largely to invest in AI and data centers.\"We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline,\" Zino wrote. \"While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility,\" he added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Stocks climbed on Tuesday after Trump delayed tariffs on the EU. Bond yields edged lower and Nvidia rose ahead of its midweek earnings report. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesStocks rallied to start the week, with a handful of catalysts on investors' radars. Trump said he would pause tariffs on the EU after calling for 50% tariffs starting on June 1 last week. Bond yields also edged lower after spiking last week, and investors are gearing up for Nvidia earnings. US stocks surged to kick off the shortened trading week, fueled by the latest tariff developments and lower bond yields, with traders also eyeing a midweek earnings report from a key mega-cap tech name. Major indexes rose at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 500 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up more than 1%.Nvidia shares jumped as traders looked forward to the chipmaker's upcoming earnings report on Wednesday. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Tuesday:S&P 500: 5,867.26 up 1.12% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,973.39, up 0.90% (+372.42 points)Nasdaq composite: 18,980.07, up 1.3%Here's what investors are watching in the holiday-shortened week: EU tariff reprieveWin McNamee/Getty ImagesOn Sunday, President Donald Trump said he would delay tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9 after Ursula von Leyen, the European Commission president, asked him to do so. Last week, the president called for 50% tariffs on the EU to start on June 1. Markets have been rocked by trade chaos for much of this year, with stocks whipsawing on the president's plans to implement or delay duties on imports. Stocks jumped after the president announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs in April, and have churned higher on recent trade deal frameworks hammered out with China and other countries.Trump took to Truth Social on Monday to reiterate the administration's progress on trade deals and to proclaim that the US was entering a \"golden age.\"\"Countries from all over the World want to make TRADE DEALS with us. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social. Calmer bond markets Douglas Rissing/Getty ImagesLong-dated bond yields dropped on Tuesday, a sign that investors in the bond market are feeling less anxious than they were last week, as traders eyed Trump's tax bill moving through Congress and digested Moody's downgrade of US debt.Importantly, Japan signaled possible changes to its plans for debt issuance that could mean less potential pressure on US yields. Bloomberg reported that the country's finance ministry was seeking comment from the market on the amount of debt issuance that it would be appropriate. Lower debt issuance could drive yields back down on Japanese bonds, and could cause domestic investors to return to US Treasurys. The 10-year US Treasury yield on Tuesday dipped four basis points to 4.46%, and the 30-year yield dropped six basis points to 4.97%. The yield on the long-dated US bond last week had climbed to its highest level since 2007. Investors are still monitoring the GOP tax bill, which is expected to add around $4 trillion to the budget deficit over the next decade, but are feeling less anxious as progress is made in other areas, like trade. \"As the bill sits with the Senate, the expectation is for a significant re-writing of the House text, given there are enough GOP Senators to vote down the bill,\" Craig Cohen, a managing director and investment specialist within JPMorgan's global investment opportunities team, wrote in a note. Nvidia earningsJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesInvestors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. The Jensen Huang-led firm is expected to report its quarterly results after the closing bell on Wednesday. The firm has beaten on earnings and revenue in recent quarters, but investors have lofty expectations for the stock, meaning its price could be volatile in the after-hours trading.\"Nvidia's valuation is expensive heading into Wednesday's earnings report, and the stock may be priced for perfection, unless Nvidia can deliver numbers that are completely beyond what Wall Street is expecting,\" Robert Ruggirello, the chief investment officer of Brave Eagle Wealth Management, wrote in a note on Tuesday.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The company will buy 400,000 of Nvidia’s latest “superchips” for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the GB200 chips, and lease the computing power they provide to OpenAI, the Financial Times (FT) reported Friday (May 23). The […] The post Oracle to Buy $40 Billion Worth of Nvidia Chips for First Stargate Data Center appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Oracle will reportedly buy $40 billion worth of Nvidia’s chips to power the first Stargate project, a new data center in Abilene, Texas. The company will buy 400,000 of Nvidia’s latest “superchips” for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the GB200 chips, and lease the computing power they provide to OpenAI, the Financial Times (FT) reported Friday (May 23). The data center is expected to be fully operational by the middle of 2026 and will be one of the largest data centers in the world, providing 1.2 gigawatts of power, according to the report. President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, saying the up-to-$500 billion project aims to build big AI-focused data centers in the U.S., with the first 10 being in Texas. Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and MGX are equity partners in Stargate, while Oracle, Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI will be the project’s initial technology partners. It was reported Wednesday (May 21) that the Abilene data center had secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments and that the funding would expand the data center to eight buildings from two and bring the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI, PYMNTS reported in January. “AI data centers are fundamentally different because they require specialized hardware and infrastructure to handle the massive parallel processing needed for AI workloads,” Deborah Perry Piscione, co-founder of Work3 Institute, an AI and Web3 advisory firm, told PYMNTS in January. “Traditional data centers focus on storage and basic compute, while AI facilities need dense configurations of GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia’s H100s, designed specifically for the complex matrix calculations that power AI models,” she added. In March, Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia joined the $30 billion AI Infrastructure Fund backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX. The Fund’s ultimate goal is to raise up to $100 billion for AI development. Microsoft and BlackRock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities.

        "description": "Nvidia CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang has reached rockstar status in Taiwan.Ann Wang/ReutersNvidia dominates Computex Taipei thanks to CEO Jensen Huang's massive popularity.\"Jensanity\" includes shirts with Huang's face and hordes of selfie-seeking crowds. The Nvidia spotlight reinforces the ties among the company, the local tech industry, and the economy.Asia's biggest tech trade show has always attracted IT insiders to Taiwan. Now, Computex Taipei is Nvidia central, with fans flocking to spot the chipmaker's leather jacket-wearing, selfie-taking CEO, Jensen Huang.I flew to Taipei for this year's event and found that Nvidia's dominance was on clear display even outside the venue, where a striking green Nvidia banner outshone Computex's event wrap.Nvidia's green banner announced the tech giant's presence at Computex.Huileng Tan/Business InsiderThe theme continued inside the conference halls, where nearly 1,500 companies compete to show their most advanced gear. Over three days at the tech show, I spotted the \"Nvidia partner\" sign prominently displayed alongside countless exhibitors' names.\"Everyone wants to ride on Nvidia's wave,\" an exhibitor associated with Nvidia told me.Taiwan's \"Jensanity\" isn't new. Last year, Huang signed a woman's chest at Nvidia's booth. But the 2025 Computex spotlight on Nvidia reinforces that the Taiwanese tech industry and the broader economy are ever more intertwined with one company, even as Nvidia navigates changing political winds and a rapidly evolving tech landscape.Andrew Hou, the president of Pan-Asia Pacific operations at Taiwanese PC maker Acer, said on Wednesday that interest in Computex was dwindling before 2024.Thanks to the burgeoning interest in AI tech, it has become \"so crowded\" at Computex since last year, Hou said at a briefing on Wednesday. He also namedropped Huang — without mentioning Nvidia — during the press event. Acer is a Nvidia partner.Sponsors are happy to play second fiddle to Nvidia's strong branding at Computex.Huileng Tan/Business InsiderThe Santa Clara, California-based AI giant has so much street cred in Taiwan that even a half-name drop will do.On Tuesday, Foxconn chairman Young Liu referred to \"Jensen\" in his keynote speech at Computex when he was describing a meeting about AI-powered manufacturing.'Jensanity'Huang arrived in Taipei on Friday afternoon.The Taiwanese cannot get enough of the Tainan-born native who migrated to the US as a child. They camp at his hotel, outside his regular hair salon, and around restaurants. The devotees are seeking sound bites, selfies, and autographs.Taiwanese fans of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outside a restaurant where he was dining.Ann Wang/ReutersMuch of Huang's story resonates with the Taiwanese public, including his rise from humble immigrant beginnings to building a trillion-dollar business from scratch. His consistent dad-biker style also helps.On Tuesday, much of the chatter at Computex centered on business, not Nvidia — but that didn't stop attendees from mobbing Huang when he showed up on the exhibition floor.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the Foxconn booth at Computex.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\"I want to take a photo with him,\" a woman squealed as other excited fans thrust pen, paper, and their mobile phones into Huang's path.Chenbro Micom, a storage and server chassis maker, seized the moment by blasting a man saying \"Chenbro, Chenbro, I love you!\" on repeat as Huang walked past its booth. The Taiwanese firm is an Nvidia partner.Folk AI heroHuang also made a guest appearance at Taiwanese chip firm MediaTek's CEO keynote on Tuesday.On stage, MediaTek boss Rick Tsai gifted Huang a bag of fruits from his favorite night market fruit stall and spelled out \"Jensen's\" appeal to the Taiwanese: He's authentic and approachable.On Monday, I found people patiently queued up to buy Nvidia merch from a van parked in front of Taipei Music Center, where Huang gave his keynote speech. By lunch, after Huang's speech ended, there were about 80 people in line, even though the mercury was hovering around 88 degrees.Nvidia's pop-up merch store attracted many fans.Huileng Tan/Business InsiderKJ Hsieh, a Taiwanese who works in business development, endured the blistering sun in his suit to snag a bag of merch. He told me he plans to wear the T-shirts on his coming vacation to Dubai.KJ Hsieh, a business development manager, shows off his newly purchased shirt with Jensen Huang prints.Huileng Tan/Business Insider\"I was interested in what Jensen Huang had to say because I used to be an engineer,\" Hsieh told me.The merch sold well, a salesperson told me. Some products — including a backpack and play cards — were already sold out for the day.Some buyers, like 26-year-old engineer Jim Wu, did not even attend the keynote.A self-professed Huang and Nvidia fan, Wu took time off work on Monday morning to snap up the merch — shirts and a thermal cup — in case they sold out.It took real effort. Wu works in Hsinchu, a 30-minute high-speed rail ride away. He declined to be photographed as his manager did not know what he was up to with his last-minute time-off request.\"Nvidia is a really successful company that I hope to work with one day,\" Wu told me.Boosting Taiwan's tech stardomHuang has leaned into his roots in the US, showcasing Taiwanese night markets at March's GTC in San Jose, California, and paying tributes to his heritage.On Monday, he greeted the keynote audience in Mandarin Chinese and gave a shout-out to his parents sitting in the back of the concert hall. On Tuesday, he cracked jokes onstage with Foxconn and MediaTek's decidedly more staid executives.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (center) shares the limelight with Foxconn chairman Young Liu (left).Ann Wang/ReutersIt's good PR, and it works both ways.The Nvidia boss consistently champions and highlights Taiwan tech, from chips to hardware. It's a far more upbeat narrative for the island compared to the international headlines highlighting a potential invasion by China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.On Monday, Huang announced a joint initiative to build an AI supercomputer with the Taiwanese government, TSMC, and Foxconn. He also announced a big new headquarters in Taipei.For the many under-the-radar Taiwanese companies that are the backbones for household names from Apple to Microsoft, Huang's showmanship and Nvidia's dominance in AI are helping them shine, too.During Huang's keynote speech, he paid a video tribute to Nvidia's many Taiwanese partners of Nvidia. The reel showcased the journey of a basic TSMC chip to an Nvidia Blackwell GPU, and beyond.\"That was pretty incredible, right? But that was you, that was you. Thank you,\" Huang said to a rapt audience, who broke out in appreciative applause.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang has reached rockstar status in Taiwan.Ann Wang/ReutersNvidia dominates Computex Taipei thanks to CEO Jensen Huang's massive popularity.\"Jensanity\" includes shirts with Huang's face and hordes of selfie-seeking crowds.

So I think, all in all, the export control is a failure,\" he said.The US started taking steps to limit China's use of high-tech chips in 2022. Huang's comments on Wednesday mark an escalation from his previous messaging about the US's controls.In February, Huang told CNBC, \"It's hard to tell whether export control is effective.\"In April, Nvidia said the Trump administration tightened rules that effectively banned the sale of the kinds of chips — H20 — Nvidia had created to comply with the Biden administration's export controls. The company said it expected a $5.5 billion charge in first-quarter earnings due to the new restrictions.About 13% of Nvidia's revenue in the year ending in January came from China and Hong Kong, down from 17% the year before.\"China is where 50% of the world's AI researchers are, and we want AI researchers to build on Nvidia. DeepSeek was built on Nvidia. That's a gift to us, that's a gift to the world,\" Huang said.On Wednesday, Huang repeated past compliments for DeepSeek, the AI startup that took global financial markets by surprise in January with a competitive new model, and for tech giant Huawei. He again called the latter, which builds its own chips, \"formidable.\"\"Our competition in China is really intense,\" Huang said. The CEO also said the US has no monopoly on AI development.\"Power is quite cost-effective in China, and there's plenty of land. So the ban on H20 is not effective,\" he said.Huang added that there was no way to further \"degrade\" the company's current graphics processing unit architecture such that buyers would want it.Bouts of broad market and tech sell-offs and angst about export controls, among other issues, have depressed investor darling Nvidia's stock recently.

        "description": "But new RDNA 4 GPU won't be coming until later this year; RTX 5060 is out now. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 were fairly well received when they were released in March, ably competing with Nvidia's RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti for the same or a little less money. We were impressed by the cards' performance and power efficiency, even if they still have some of the same caveats as older Radeon cards (lack of DLSS upscaling and lower relative ray-tracing performance being two). Today AMD is formally expanding its family of RDNA 4 graphics cards with the Radeon RX 9060 XT, a GPU that will go up against Nvidia's RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti GPUs. These GPUs have just half the compute units of the RX 9070 XT, but at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB configurations, they ought to be decent options for 1080p or entry-level 1440p gaming PCs (with the eternal \"if you can find them\" caveat that comes with buying a GPU in 2025). AMD says the new GPUs will be available \"beginning later this year\" from the typical range of partners—AMD released renders of a reference GPU design, but sometimes these are starting points that manufacturers can take or leave, rather than products AMD intends to manufacture and sell itself.Read full article Comments",

Chipmaker Nvidia announced Sunday (May 18) that it is launching an artificial intelligence marketplace for developers to tap an expanded list of graphics processing unit (GPU) cloud providers in addition to hyperscalers. Called DGX Cloud Lepton, the service acts as a unified interface linking developers to a decentralized network of cloud providers that offer Nvidia’s GPUs for AI workloads. Typically, developers must rely on cloud hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud to access GPUs. However, with GPUs in high demand, Nvidia seeks to open the availability of GPUs from an expanded roster of cloud providers beyond hyperscalers. When one cloud provider has some idle GPUs in between jobs, these chips will be available in the marketplace for another developer to tap. The marketplace will include GPU cloud providers CoreWeave, Crusoe, Lambda, SoftBank and others, according to a Sunday press release. The move comes as Nvidia looks to address growing frustration among startups, enterprises and researchers over limited GPU availability. With AI model training requiring vast compute resources — especially for large language models and computer vision systems — developers often face long wait times or capacity shortages. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in March that the computing power needed to train the next stage of AI has “grown tremendously.” The trajectory of GPU demand was in doubt in late January when startup DeepSeek disclosed that it trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,048 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for OpenAI and the like. The news wiped out Nvidia’s market value by nearly $600 billion in one day, as Wall Street sold off the stock thinking GPU demand was overblown. Huang said in March he believes that demand will be even greater in the future because of agentic AI and reasoning. He predicted that working alongside 1 billion knowledge workers will be 10 billion AI agents. DGX Cloud Lepton fits into the future, functioning as a discovery tool and marketplace, enabling users to compare and select from various cloud GPU vendors based on availability, cost and other preferences. Developers retain full autonomy over their provider choices, and the company does not restrict or intermediate those relationships, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday (May 19). This direct approach to developers also signals a strategic shift for Nvidia. Traditionally, the company worked behind the scenes with cloud providers who would, in turn, offer access to Nvidia hardware. Now, Nvidia is cultivating its own relationship with developers and enterprise customers, a move that could strengthen its influence in the growing AI services ecosystem.

        "description": "Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at Computex in Taiwan on Monday.I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty ImagesOne of tech's biggest celebrities, Jensen Huang, spoke on Monday at a major industry show in Taiwan.Huang said Nvidia is building a new office in northern Taipei.He also introduced a new desktop system and talked about China's DeepSeek R1 model.Taiwan's biggest tech celebrity — clad in his signature black leather jacket — ran onstage in Taipei on Monday morning with a lot to talk about.Jensen Huang's 100-minute keynote at the tech show Computex featured Nvidia's usual assortment of high-tech videos, complete with a cute robot, and praise for semiconductor hub Taiwan.The tech titan also outlined new products and a significant regional expansion. Business Insider was in the audience while Huang spoke — here are the top four takeaways from his speech.1. Nvidia's new officeSpeculation about Nvidia's new office in Taiwan has been brewing since Huang said in January that the company's current building was too small and that it was \"looking for real estate.\"On Monday, Taipei's mayor, Chiang Wan-an, generated buzz when he showed up at Huang's keynote. Huang went on to announce that Nvidia is eying the Beitou Shilin area — home to a science park — in northern Taipei for the tech giant's new Taiwan office, named \"Nvidia Constellation.\"The announcement was met with applause and cheers from the audience.Chiang said in a media interview following Huang's keynote that the city government welcomes Nvidia's move and will provide any necessary assistance.2. New computer systemsHuang introduced Nvidia's DGX systems, which are designed for users who want heavy-duty AI without dedicating significant storage space to a weighty server system.The physical workstation can be used as a single computer or as a central node for multiple users.\"This computer is the most performance you can possibly get out of a wall socket. You could put this in your kitchen. But just barely, if you put this in your kitchen and then somebody runs the microwave, I think that's the limit,\" he joked.Huang said the cloud-based system — DGX Spark — will be ready in a few weeks. Nvidia is working with companies including Dell and HP on the systems.\"I'll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing's for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,\" Huang said.3. DeepSeek praiseHuang talked software, too.He praised the DeepSeek R1 model, saying that it's \"genuinely a gift to the world's AI industry.\"\"The amount of computer science breakthroughs is really quite significant and has really opened up a lot of great research for researchers in the United States and around the world,\" Huang said.He said DeepSeek R1 — owned by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer — has made a \"real impact\" in how people think about AI and that it has made a \"great contribution to the industry and the world.\"Shares of Nvidia and many of its peers were clobbered in January, as Wall Street grappled with how to price in the new, seemingly cheaper technology.Huang said in February that investors got it wrong because the industry will still need computing power for post-training.4. New AI supercomputer for TaiwanHuang announced an Nvidia collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Foxconn — the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer — and the Taiwanese government to build an AI supercomputer for the island.Nvidia's joint effort with the Taiwanese government and Taiwan's top tech giants highlights the Santa Clara-based company's close ties to the hub of global chipmaking.Born in Tainan in southern Taiwan before he moved to the US as a child, Huang's meteoric rise to the top of tech royalty has captivated Taiwan and catapulted him to folk hero status.In Taiwan, Huang is surrounded by local media and fans who ask for selfies and autographs. The celebrity factor has also rubbed off on Nvidia, the company he cofounded, at home and abroad. The chipmaker's stock is up nearly 43% in the last year.Read the original article on Business Insider Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at Computex in Taiwan on Monday.I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty ImagesOne of tech's biggest celebrities, Jensen Huang, spoke on Monday at a major industry show in Taiwan.Huang said Nvidia is building a new office in northern Taipei.He also introduced a new desktop system and talked about China's DeepSeek R1 model.Taiwan's biggest tech celebrity — clad in his signature black leather jacket — ran onstage in Taipei on Monday morning with a lot to talk about.Jensen Huang's 100-minute keynote at the tech show Computex featured Nvidia's usual assortment of high-tech videos, complete with a cute robot, and praise for semiconductor hub Taiwan.The tech titan also outlined new products and a significant regional expansion.

Chipmaker Nvidia is reportedly working to lessen its dependency on Big Tech. The company is doing this by forging new partnerships to sell artificial intelligence (AI) to national governments, corporations and challengers to companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (May 18). The report came days after Nvidia announced a multibillion-dollar U.S. chip deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, while the United Arab Emirates announced plans to build one of the world’s largest data centers in partnership with the American government, as the Gulf states work to construct massive AI infrastructure. According to the FT, these “sovereign AI” deals make up a key part of the $3.2 trillion tech giant’s strategy of attracting customers far beyond Silicon Valley. Company executives, industry insiders, and analysts tell the FT that Nvidia aims to boost its business beyond “hyperscalers,” or large cloud computing companies that make up more than half its data center revenue. That means boosting burgeoning rivals to the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, companies that include such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. Nvidia announced in February that CoreWeave was “the first cloud service provider to make the Nvidia Blackwell platform generally available,” referring to its newest generation of processors for AI data centers. The company has also forged collaborations with suppliers such as Cisco, Dell and HP, to help sell to enterprise customers, which manage their own corporate IT infrastructure rather than outsourcing to the cloud. “I’m more certain [about the business opportunity beyond the big cloud providers] today than I was a year ago,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the FT in March. Meanwhile, Nvidia said earlier this month that it is advancing what it calls “embodied intelligence,” or AI that can perceive, reason and act in industries that include manufacturing, biotechnology and transportation. Per a Fast Company report, the company sees these capabilities as critical to future breakthroughs in robotics, drug development and autonomous navigation. “For AI to be truly useful, it must engage meaningfully with real-world use cases,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning, told that magazine. At a tech conference in Singapore last month, Nvidia presented company-authored papers, covering healthcare, robotics, autonomous vehicles and large language models, continuing a collaborative push into AI that has seen partnerships with Google, GE Healthcare and GM.

They also got Nvidia into the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and put it in the position to control the flow of a crucial but finite resource: artificial intelligence.Nvidia's first generation of chips for the data center launched in 2017. That first generation was called Volta. Along with the Volta chips, Nvidia designed DGX (which stands for Deep GPU Xceleration) systems — the full stack of technologies and equipment necessary to bring GPUs online in a data center and make them work to the best of their ability. DGX was the first of its kind. As AI has become more mainstream, other companies such as Dell and and Supermicro have put forth designs for running GPUs at scale in a data center too.Ampere, Hopper, Blackwell, and BeyondThe next GPU generation designed for the data center, Ampere, which launched in 2020, can still be found in data centers today.Though Ampere generation GPUs are slowly fading into the background in favor of more powerful models, this generation did support the first iteration of Nvidia's Omniverse, a simulation platform that the company purports as key to a future where robots work alongside humans doing physical tasks.The Hopper generation of GPUs is the one that has enabled much of the latest innovation in large language models and broader AI.Nvidia's Hopper generation of chips, which include the H100 and the H200, debuted in 2022 and remain in high demand. The H200 model in particular has added capacity that has proven increasingly important as AI models grow in size, complexity, and capability.The most powerful chip architecture Nvidia has launched to date is Blackwell. Jensen Huang announced the step change in accelerated computing in 2024 at GTC, Nvidia's developers conference, and though the rollout has been rocky, racks of Blackwells are now available from cloud providers.Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip at the GTC conference in 2024.Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty ImagesInside the data center, Nvidia does have competitors, even though it has the vast majority of the market for AI computing. Those competitors include AMD, Intel, Huawei, custom AI chips, and a cavalcade of startups.The company has already teased that the next generation will be called \"Blackwell Ultra,\" followed by \"Rubin\" in 2026. Nvidia also plans to launch a new CPU, or traditional computer chip alongside Rubin, which it hasn't done since 2022. CPUs work alongside GPUs to triage tasks and direct the firepower that is parallel computing.Nvidia is a software company, tooNone of this high-powered computing is possible without software and Nvidia recognized this need sooner than any other company.Development for Nvidia's tentpole software stack, CUDA or Compute Unified Device Architecture, began as early as 2006. CUDA is software that allows developers to use widely known coding languages to program GPUs, since these chips require layers of code to work relatively few developers have the needed skills to program the chips directly.Still \"CUDA developer\" is a skillset and there are millions who claim this ability, according to Nvidia.When GPUs started going into data centers, CUDA was ready and that's why it's often touted as the basis for Nvidia's competitive moat.Within CUDA are dozens of libraries that help developers use GPUs in specific fields such as medical imaging, data science, or weather analytics.Nvidia began at homeJust two years after Nvidia's founding, the company released its first graphics card in 1995. For more than a decade, the chips mostly resided in homes and offices — used by gamers and graphics professionals.The current generation includes the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080, which was released in May 2025. RTX 4090, 4080, 4070, and 4060, were released in 2022 and 2023. GPUs in gaming enabled the more sophisticated shadows, texture, and light to make games hyperrealistic.In addition to the consumer work stations, Nvidia partners with device-makers like Apple and ASUS to produce laptops and personal computers. Though gaming is now a minority of the company's revenue, the business continues to grow.Nvidia has also made new efforts to enable high powered computing at home for the machine-learning obsessed. It launched Project DIGITS, which is a personal-sized supercomputer capable of working with some of the largest large language models.Nvidia in the carNvidia is angling to be a primary player in a future where self-driving cars are the norm, but the company has also been in the automotive semiconductor game for many years.Nvidia first launched its DRIVE PX, for developing autopilot capabilities for vehicles, in 2015.Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty ImagesIt launched Nvidia DRIVE, a platform for autonomous vehicle development, in 2015, and over time it developed or acquired technologies for mapping, driver assist, and driver monitoring.The company designs various chips for all of functions in partnerships with Mediatek and Foxconn. Nvidia's automotive customers include Toyota, Uber, and Hyundai.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia products, such as GPUs and software, are driving the AI boom.Brittany Hosea-Small/REUTERSNvidia products, such as data center GPUs, are crucial for AI, making it the leader in the industry.Nvidia's CUDA software stack supports GPU programming, enhancing its competitive edge.Nvidia's automotive and consumer tech ventures expand its influence beyond data centers.Nvidia products are at the heart of the boom in artificial intelligence.Despite starting in gaming and designing semiconductors that touch many diverse industries, the products Nvidia designs to go inside high-powered data centers are the most important to the company today, and to the future of AI.Graphics processing units, designed to be clustered together in dozens of racks inside massive temperature-controlled warehouses, made Nvidia a household name.

Along with the Volta chips, Nvidia designed DGX (which stands for Deep GPU Xceleration) systems — the full stack of technologies and equipment necessary to bring GPUs online in a data center and make them work to the best of their ability. DGX was the first of its kind. As AI has become more mainstream, other companies such as Dell and and Supermicro have put forth designs for running GPUs at scale in a data center too.Ampere, Hopper, Blackwell, and BeyondThe next GPU generation designed for the data center, Ampere, which launched in 2020, can still be found in data centers today.Though Ampere generation GPUs are slowly fading into the background in favor of more powerful models, this generation did support the first iteration of Nvidia's Omniverse, a simulation platform that the company purports as key to a future where robots work alongside humans doing physical tasks.The Hopper generation of GPUs is the one that has enabled much of the latest innovation in large language models and broader AI.Nvidia's Hopper generation of chips, which include the H100 and the H200, debuted in 2022 and remain in high demand. The H200 model in particular has added capacity that has proven increasingly important as AI models grow in size, complexity, and capability.The most powerful chip architecture Nvidia has launched to date is Blackwell. Jensen Huang announced the step change in accelerated computing in 2024 at GTC, Nvidia's developers conference, and though the rollout has been rocky, racks of Blackwells are now available from cloud providers.Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip at the GTC conference in 2024.Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty ImagesInside the data center, Nvidia does have competitors, even though it has the vast majority of the market for AI computing. Those competitors include AMD, Intel, Huawei, custom AI chips, and a cavalcade of startups.The company has already teased that the next generation will be called \"Blackwell Ultra,\" followed by \"Rubin\" in 2026. Nvidia also plans to launch a new CPU, or traditional computer chip alongside Rubin, which it hasn't done since 2022. CPUs work alongside GPUs to triage tasks and direct the firepower that is parallel computing.Nvidia is a software company, tooNone of this high-powered computing is possible without software and Nvidia recognized this need sooner than any other company.Development for Nvidia's tentpole software stack, CUDA or Compute Unified Device Architecture, began as early as 2006. CUDA is software that allows developers to use widely known coding languages to program GPUs, since these chips require layers of code to work relatively few developers have the needed skills to program the chips directly.Still \"CUDA developer\" is a skillset and there are millions who claim this ability, according to Nvidia.When GPUs started going into data centers, CUDA was ready and that's why it's often touted as the basis for Nvidia's competitive moat.Within CUDA are dozens of libraries that help devel",

        "description": "Tech giants like Jensen Huang's Nvidia are launching projects to bring AI to every part of healthcare.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesTech's heaviest hitters are racing to build new AI tech for healthcare.They're landing partnerships with health systems and Big Pharma and selling consumer health AI tech.Here's how tech powerhouses from Microsoft to Alphabet to Nvidia are investing in healthcare AI.Artificial intelligence is gaining ground in healthcare, and tech's biggest players are racing to stake their claims.Many tech giants have been building healthcare businesses long before the AI boom. Amazon, for example, invested heavily in the industry when it acquired primary care provider One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2022.Now, those tech powerhouses are sharpening their healthcare strategies with AI at the center. Chipmaker Nvidia has rapidly expanded its healthcare ambitions in the past two years, aiming to tackle everything from surgical robotics to drug discovery.Their healthcare ambitions reflect a broader shift: as AI advances, Big Tech sees fresh opportunities for transformation — and revenue — in the complex industry.From AI-powered wearables to robotic surgery, here's how tech's most powerful companies are investing in healthcare AI.Microsoft: Doubling down on its healthcare cloudMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella.Jason Redmond / AFP/ Getty ImagesMicrosoft first entered healthcare nearly two decades ago. Now, it's integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations.Microsoft bought the ambient intelligence company Nuance in 2022 for nearly $20 billion. Nuance dominates the market for AI-powered medical scribing, though it now faces tough competition from startups like $2.75 billion Abridge. Its latest release is Dragon Copilot, a solution Microsoft announced in March that integrates the company's voice dictation tech with Nuance's ambient listening, in a move the company said would help doctors save even more time documenting patient visits.In an October 2024 KLAS report, most healthcare organizations said they considered Nuance when purchasing a clinical documentation solution, in part due to prior contracts with Microsoft and the company's extensive healthcare software suite. The tech giant is integrating AI into those other healthcare cloud offerings to organize and analyze medical records and automate tasks like patient scheduling and paperwork.Microsoft also partners with Nvidia to combine Nvidia's AI tech with Microsoft's cloud solutions to power advanced healthcare and biopharma research and better medical imaging.Apple: Banking on AI-powered consumer health trackingDr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai, Apple's vice president of health.AppleApple's AI efforts have been understated compared to its peers, as have its healthcare investments.Much of Apple's healthcare attention to date has focused on its Apple Watch, which includes several AI-powered health features for consumers, from AI-powered fall detection and irregular heartbeat tracking to sleep analysis.After Apple released its augmented reality headset Apple Vision Pro last year, the company said multiple healthcare organizations were using the new tech for various applications, including reviewing patient surgical plans or training clinicians to use new medical devices.Apple's next big health AI push could be on the horizon. Bloomberg News reported at the end of March that Apple was developing an AI-powered health coach to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations based on its consumers' health data, as tracked through devices like the Apple Watch and iPhone.TK APPLE COMMENTNvidia: Bringing \"physical AI\" to the hospitalKimberly Powell, Nvidia's VP of healthcare.HLTHChip giant Nvidia is digging into a wide range of healthcare specialties, from radiology to drug discovery, primarily by partnering with other healthcare companies.Nvidia VP of healthcare Kimberly Powell told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched a number of medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March. GE Healthcare plans to use Nvidia's tech to simulate autonomous medical imaging, including autonomous X-rays and ultrasounds, to test their application in physical medical devices.It's a similar collaboration to Nvidia's existing deal with IT solutions provider Mark III to work with healthcare systems to create simulations of their hospital environments for AI development. \"Physical AI,\" or AI that can analyze and interact with the physical world, is a key part of Nvidia's vision for healthcare. \"This physical AI thing is coming where your whole hospital is going to turn into an AI,\" Powell told BI in November. \"You're going to have eyes operating on your behalf, robots doing what is otherwise automatable work, and smart digital devices. So we're super excited about that, and we're doing a lot of investments.\"Nvidia is also an investor in several healthcare startups, most notably clinical documentation startup Abridge, which raised $250 million in February from investors including Nvidia's venture arm NVentures at a $2.75 billion valuation, and Hippocratic AI, which raised $141 million in Series B funding from NVentures and other firms at a $1.64 billion valuation.It's also partnered with many of its portfolio companies, such as Moon Surgical, a robotics company that uses Nvidia's medical device AI platform Holoscan for its surgical assistant robot.Amazon: Adding more tech to consumer careAmazon CEO Andy JassyBrendan McDermid/REUTERSAmazon is bringing AI to doctors, patients, and pharma companies across its healthcare businesses.In March, Amazon announced it was testing a new chatbot feature called Health AI, which the company says can give users advice and suggest products for common medical needs. The health AI assistant can direct users to Amazon's online pharmacy or to talk to a doctor at its primary care chain, One Medical, for further care. An Amazon spokesperson told BI that the chatbot is in beta, and the retailer is collecting feedback from customers and working on new features for its AI assistant.The retail giant also offers its own medical transcription tool, called HealthScribe, which analyzes doctor-patient conversations to create clinical notes for providers. It's one of several AI capabilities that One Medical's clinicians use, in addition to features that assist with patient messaging and care coordination.Amazon provides a number of generative AI tools through Amazon Web Services for life sciences companies, too. Genentech and AstraZeneca, for example, have used AWS's AI tools for drug discovery research and clinical trial tasks.Amazon has also suffered more false starts in healthcare than its peers. The retailer shut down its telehealth service Amazon Care in 2022, three years after its launch, and discontinued its wearable fitness tracker Amazon Halo in 2023. Last year, One Medical came under fire after media reports and a malpractice lawsuit raised concerns about the primary care chain's patient safety practices. An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is prohibited by law from discussing patient records, but that One Medical has extensive quality and safe measures in place for patient care.Alphabet: Powering better health research with foundation models and search toolsGoogle's chief health officer Dr. Karen DeSalvo.Google HealthAlphabet has created several healthcare AI tools that build upon Google's core search capabilities, with a focus on healthcare-specific foundation models.Google launched MedLM, a set of healthcare foundation models, in 2023 to enable tech to summarize patient-doctor conversations, conduct clinical research, and automate insurance claims processing. In October, it announced Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, a specialized search engine that gives clinicians answers to their medical questions about a patient's health records or medical documents. It's also built a research AI system designed to assist with patient diagnosis, which can analyze data such as medical images and simulate patient-provider interactions.On the consumer front, Google has released a number of tools with health applications, such as Google Lens, which allows people to take a picture of their own skin and search for visually similar skin conditions. It's also working on personal health AI models that can interpret sleep and fitness data to offer personalized wellness suggestions.Isomorphic Labs, Alphabet's AI research arm spun out of Google DeepMind, has partnered with pharma giants like Novartis and Eli Lilly on more efficient drug development, building on DeepMind's AlphaFold protein structures.Dr. Karen DeSalvo has led Google's health initiatives since 2019. At the beginning of May, she announced her retirement as chief health officer; Google Health chief clinical officer Dr. Michael Howell will replace her when she steps down in August.Oracle: Leveling up health records with AILarry Ellison, cofounder of Oracle.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesOracle's long-awaited plans to revolutionize electronic medical records with AI will come to fruition this year, according to the tech company.In October, Oracle unveiled its \"next-generation\" electronic health record system, which the company said would incorporate several of Oracle's cloud and AI capabilities, including clinical AI agents, search capabilities, and patient data analytics. Its goal is to seamlessly integrate AI into providers' workflows and automate healthcare administrative tasks. The AI-powered EHR is slated for release to early adopters this year, the company said.Oracle made its biggest investment toward this goal in 2022, when it bought EHR company Cerner for $28.3 billion and rebranded it as Oracle Health. Its efforts to transform Cerner have hit a number of snags, however. BI reported in May 2024 that flaws in Cerner's EHR rollout at the Department of Veteran",

This is because companies are starting to move away from the scaling law \"which required continuous expansion of the training cluster,\" Lau said.\"And now we can see even with a smaller cluster, you can actually achieve very good training results.

Nvidia designed the H20 chip based on the Biden administration's chip export restrictions.Analysts, however, have said the Trump administration's new restrictions will not slow down China's progress in AI.\"Banning the H20 would make no sense as its performance is already well below Chinese alternatives; a ban would simply hand the Chinese AI market completely over to Huawei,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to investors on April 23.Tencent did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider Tencent's president Martin Lau said the company can rely on a \"pretty strong stockpile of chips that we acquired previously.\"Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesTencent's president Martin Lau says company has a \"pretty strong stockpile of chips.\"Last month, Nvidia said the Trump administration imposed new chip export restrictions to China.Lau said Tencent has enough chips to train its AI models \"for a few more generations going forward.\"The Chinese tech giant Tencent said it has a \"pretty strong stockpile of chips\" to tide it through America's chip sale restrictions.The company's president, Martin Lau, was speaking to investors during an earnings call on Wednesday when he was asked how Tencent would deal with US chip restrictions.Lau said \"it's a very dynamic situation\" that Tencent is managing, and it's trying to \"figure out the right solution\" to make sure its AI strategy \"can still be executed.\"Lau told investors that Tencent can rely on a \"pretty strong stockpile of chips that we acquired previously.\" Lau said the chips will be deployed to projects that can \"generate immediate returns for us,\" such as in Tencent's advertising business.When it comes to training Tencent's large language models, Lau said the company will not need a large number of chips to improve its performance.

        "description": "Digital Foundry also says Game Chat \"has a significant impact on system resources.\" While Nintendo offered an official spec sheet for the Switch 2 last month, neither it nor an accompanying blog post from chip-making partner Nvidia provided many specific numbers for the upcoming console's raw CPU and GPU horsepower. Today, though, Digital Foundry is offering what it calls \"rock-solid confirmation\" of the system's final tech specs, adding detail and clarity to years-old leaks and educated speculation on the system's internals (which turned out to be largely reliable in the end). Unlike the Switch—which basically used an off-the-shelf Nvidia Tegra T1 chip—Digital Foundry says the Switch 2 is using \"very much custom silicon designed specifically for Nintendo and for mobile gaming.\" You can see what that means in terms of raw hardware performance in the tables below. Switch 2 Switch Docked (Quality) Undocked (Performance) Docked (Quality) Undocked (Performance) CPU clock 998 Mhz 1101 Mhz 1020 Mhz 1020 Mhz GPU clock 1007 Mhz 561 Mhz 768 Mhz 460 Mhz Ray-tracing 20 gigarays/sec 10 gigarays/sec N/A N/A Memory bandwidth 102GB/s 68GB/s 25.6GB/s 21.3GB/s Switch 2 Switch Total System (reserved) Total System (reserved) CPU cores 8 2 4 1 Memory 12GB (LPDDR5X) 3GB 4GB 0.8GB Switch 2 Switch CPU architecture 8x ARM Cortex A78C 4x ARM Cortex A57 GPU architecture Ampere Maxwell CUDA Cores 1536 256 Memory interface 128-bit/LPDDR5 64-bit/LPDDR4 Glancing at those numbers, it's easy to pick out a large difference between the system's performance in docked and undocked modes; its CPU and GPU clocks and memory bandwidth all increase substantially when plugged into a TV. Those differences could help explain why the Switch 2 dock uses an active cooling fan, unlike the much simpler TV-connection dock on the original Switch.Read full article Comments",

The president's first major overseas tour of his second term has begun with the flow of billions of dollars as US companies have lined up to announce deals with Middle Eastern nations.A flurry of announcements came out of the Saudi-US Investment Forum held in Riyadh on Tuesday, where deal after deal emerged.In January, Trump announced that Saudi Arabia had committed to investing $600 billion in the US over the next four years, a sign that both countries were seeking to build closer ties.Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader and crown prince, has made it a priority for his country to diversify its economy away from oil as part of his grand economic plan, Vision 2030.It's why he has been busy courting business leaders in the US, with the likes of Elon Musk, OpenAI boss Sam Altman, and BlackRock's Larry Fink all in attendance at the investment forum on Tuesday.Here's a look at some of the major deals that have been announced during Trump's visit so far.An arms deal worth $142 billionTrump marked the first day of his Middle East tour with a $142 billion arms deal.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe US and Saudi Arabia struck an arms deal worth nearly $142 billion on the first day of Trump's trip to the Middle East. The White House described it as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"The deal would see the US provide Saudi Arabia with \"state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,\" according to the White House.The services will offer Saudi Arabia defense coverage that includes air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, maritime and coastal security, border security and information and communication systems upgrades, Trump's administration added.Nvidia brings chips to Saudi ArabiaNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is bringing chips to the Middle East.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia's grand plans to become a regional leader in AI depend on its access to highly advanced chips to train and run leading models.

American tech giants are reportedly upping their Gulf State investments amid President Trump’s visit to the region. The Trump administration has brokered deals for two Middle Eastern allies — Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — to bolster their artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, Bloomberg news reported Tuesday (May 13). New agreements with the U.S., expected to be announced in the days ahead, will give the two countries more access to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the report said. But even before any official announcement of deals between the U.S. and its partners, reports began to surface of American firms preparing new projects in the region, Bloomberg added. For example, Nvidia is set to supply its most advanced artificial intelligence-related chips to Saudi Arabia’s Humain, a company started to advance the country’s AI infrastructure efforts. Under this agreement, Humain will get “several hundred thousand” of Nvidia’s most advanced processors over the next five years. Humain and Amazon are also investing upwards of $5 billion on an “AI zone” in Saudi Arabia, the report added. The project will use tech from the Amazon Web Services cloud business to develop a marketplace of AI agents for use by the Saudi government. In another proposed deal, OpenAI is mulling developing new data center capacity in the United Arab Emirates that could massively expand its footprint in the Middle East, according to sources familiar with the matter. This deal could be announced in time for Trump’s UAE visit Thursday (May 15), Bloomberg said, noting that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also in the Middle East as part of a larger tour by tech leaders. PYMNTS explored AI’s potential to transform the Middle East in a report last year after Saudi Arabia established a $40 billion AI investment fund. “Successful AI development efforts could not only lead to a wave of local creativity and innovation such as new startups, and attracting generation of students to the field, but could spread the resulting prosperity across the region, countering local disbalances and democratizing the knowledge economy to attract the brightest minds,” geopolitical analyst Irina Tsukerman said in an interview for that report. And projects like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, boasting more than $900 billion in assets, is working to establish itself as a global AI leader, Bas Kooijman, CEO and asset manager at DHF Capital, said in an interview with PYMNTS. “The fund could spur innovation, attract global tech partnerships, and accelerate AI adoption across various industries within the region, contributing significantly to Saudi Arabia’s GDP,” he added.

        "description": "Nvidia topped a $3 trillion valuation for the first time since February. A fresh AI partnership with Saudi Arabia was boosting the stock on Tuesday. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesNvidia surged after announcing a partnership with a Saudi Arabia tech firm.The stock's intraday high pushed Nvidia's market cap past $3 trillion for the first time since February. Nvidia will provide Saudi Arabia with advanced chips for an AI buildout.The move: Nvidia stock jumped as much as 6.4% to hit an intraday high of $130.99 per share on Monday, The rally pushed to stock to a market cap of $3.16 trillion, the highest valuation for the chip titan since February. Shares are down 2.5% year-to-date.Why: The tech giant is surging after the company announced a strategic partnership with Humain, an AI firm that's a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Nvidia will provide Humain with its most advanced semiconductors to power AI factories throughout the kingdom. The first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will deploy 18,000 GB300 Grace Blackwell chips, according to a press release.The news follows on the heels of a separate partnership announced on Tuesday between the US and Saudi Arabia, which will see Riyadh invest $600 billion in America's AI and energy infrastructure, among other things.What it means: Tuesday's rally has pushed Nvidia back into the $3 trillion market capitalization club after the stock tumbled early in 2025 amid a broader sell-off sparked by tariff uncertainty. The company first crossed the threshold last summer, joining an exclusive club that counts only Apple and Microsoft as its other members.With shares surging, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2% on Tuesday, surpassing a 1% gain in the S&P 500.

        "description": "The Nasdaq 100 was on track to end Monday's session in bull market territory after the US and China agree to lower tariffs for 90 days. Wall Street bullRobert Nickelsberg/Getty ImagesThe Nasdaq 100 entered a bull market on Monday as stocks rallied on US-China trade progress.The US and China over the weekend agreed to lower tariffs for 90 days.Tesla rose 8% and Nvidia jumped 5%, with all other Magnificent Seven names also gaining.A big U-turn in the trade war over the weekend sent the Nasdaq 100 soaring on Monday, with the tech-heavy index on track to end the session in a bull market.The Nasdaq 100 soared as much as 4% on Monday, spiking after the US and China announced a breakthrough in negotiations. The early gains pushed the Nasdaq up 21% from its low on April 8, returning the index to levels not seen since late February. A bull market is defined by a 20% rise from the most recent low.Nasdaq 100Monday's big rally was felt across the board, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also surging. But market euphoria over tariff relief was particularly visible among mega-cap tech stocks, with the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks leading the upside.Here are the moves in the top tech names on Monday morning:Amazon: +9.6%Tesla: +8%Meta: +7%Apple: +6.5%Nvidia: +5%Google: 2.86%Microsoft: +1.6%The announcement over the weekend that US tariffs on China would drop from 145% to 30% for 90 days is welcome news for many Big Tech firms with supply chains or customers in China. Apple has been particularly exposed, with China being its main manufacturing hub and a major market for its devices.Tech stocks also gained ahead of the tariff truce, with mega-cap names helping to drive first-quarter earnings growth in recent weeks. Magnificent Seven tech earnings grew 28% compared to 9% for the rest of the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs said.Nvidia, the top semiconductor stock at the heart of artificial intelligence trade, will report results on May 28. The stock climbed last week on news that the Trump administration would do away with Biden-era chip export restrictions.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.That enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.The company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.Thanks to the prescience of Nvidia's leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.AMDAMD, led by CEO Lisa Su, lags behind Nvidia but remains its most serious competitor.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD is Nvidia's top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center. Helmed by its formidable CEO Lisa Su, AMD launched its own GPU, called the MI300, for the data center in 2024, more than a full year after Nvidia's second generation of data center GPUs started shipping.Though experts and analysts have touted the chip's specifications and potential based on its design and architecture, the company's software is still somewhat behind that of Nvidia, making these chips somewhat harder to program and use to their full potential.Analysts predict that the company has under 15% market share. But AMD executives insist that they are committed to bringing its software up to par and that future expectations for the evolution of the accelerated computing market will benefit the company — specifically, the spread of AI into so-called edge devices like phones and laptops.Qualcomm, Broadcom, and custom chipsAlso challenging Nvidia are application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. These custom-designed chips are less versatile than GPUs, but they can be designed for specific AI computing workloads at a much lower cost, which have made them a popular option for hyperscalers.Though multipurpose chips like Nvidia's and AMD's graphics processing units are likely to maintain the largest share of the AI-chip market in the long term, custom chips are growing fast. Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.Companies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.Marvell is in part responsible for Amazon's Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google's tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.Amazon and GoogleWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.Amazon's Trainium chips and Google's TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia chips, mostly for the companies' internal AI workloads. However, the companies have shown some progress in getting customers and partners to use their chips as well. Anthropic has committed to running some workloads on Amazon's chips, and Apple has done the same with Google's.IntelIntel and its Gaudi line of AI chips has struggled to compete with Nvidia and AMD.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesOnce the great American name in chip-making, Intel has fallen far behind its competitors in the age of AI. But, the firm does have a line of AI chips called Gaudi that some reports have said can stand up to Nvidia's in some respects.Intel installed a new CEO, semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan, in the first quarter of 2025 and one of his first actions was to flatten the organization so that the AI chip operations reports directly to him.HuaweiThough Nvidia's American hopeful challengers are many, China's Huawei is perhaps the most concerning competitor of all for Nvidia and all those concerned with continued US supremacy in AI.Huang himself has called Huawei the \"single most formidable\" tech company in China. Reports that Huawei's AI chip innovation is catching up are increasing in frequency. New restrictions from the Biden and Trump administrations on shipping even lower-power GPUs to China have further incentivized the company to catch up and serve the Chinese markets for AI. Analysts say further restrictions being considered by the Trump administration are now unlikely to hamper China's AI progress.StartupsAlso challenging Nvidia are a host of startups offering new chip designs and business models to the AI computing market.These firms are starting out at a disadvantage, as they don't have the full-sized sales and distribution machines decades of chip sales in other types of tech bring. But several are holding their own by finding use cases, customers, and distribution methods that are attractive to customers based on faster processing speeds or lower cost. These new AI players include Cerebras, Etched, Groq, Positron AI, Sambanova Systems, and Tenstorrent, among others.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space.

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it would be a big loss to lose access to China's growing AI market.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesJensen Huang thinks China's AI market could be worth $50 billion in a few years' time.In an interview with CNBC, he said it would be a big loss to lose access to that market.The Nvidia CEO raised concerns about the possibility of being shut out from China amid tougher export controls.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said it would be a \"tremendous loss\" for his chip company to lose access to a rapidly growing AI market in China that he estimates to soon be worth $50 billion.In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, the Nvidia boss addressed concerns about the growing restrictions facing his company as the US government seeks to clamp down on the sale of its high-performing AI chips to China.According to Huang, \"China is a very large market\" that will present a $50 billion addressable market within the next two to three years.\"It would be a tremendous loss not to be able to address it as an American company,\" Huang said.\"It's going to bring back revenues, it's going to bring back taxes, it's going to create lots of jobs here in the United States,\" he added. Nvidia has added trillions of dollars in value since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, as AI companies in the US, China, and elsewhere have sought its chips, known as GPUs, to train and host increasingly smarter AI models.However, Nvidia's boom in the generative AI era has taken a hit in recent months, with the company's share price down almost 18% year-to-date.One of the biggest concerns facing Nvidia investors has been the potential long-term impact of President Donald Trump's tariff regime and export controls on advanced technologies to China.In its last earnings, Nvidia reported $17.1 billion in revenue from China for its last fiscal year, marking a 66% increase from the $10.3 billion it generated the year before.However, last month, the company disclosed a $5.5 billion hit to earnings due to restrictions on sales of its H20 chips to China.In the interview with CNBC, Huang acknowledged the earnings hit disclosed last month, while stating that his company would \"stay agile and keep moving on\" and do \"whatever's in the best interest of our country.\"Nvidia did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it would be a big loss to lose access to China's growing AI market.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesJensen Huang thinks China's AI market could be worth $50 billion in a few years' time.In an interview with CNBC, he said it would be a big loss to lose access to that market.The Nvidia CEO raised concerns about the possibility of being shut out from China amid tougher export controls.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said it would be a \"tremendous loss\" for his chip company to lose access to a rapidly growing AI market in China that he estimates to soon be worth $50 billion.In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, the Nvidia boss addressed concerns about the growing restrictions facing his company as the US government seeks to clamp down on the sale of its high-performing AI chips to China.According to Huang, \"China is a very large market\" that will present a $50 billion addressable market within the next two to three years.\"It would be a tremendous loss not to be able to address it as an American company,\" Huang said.\"It's going to bring back revenues, it's going to bring back taxes, it's going to create lots of jobs here in the United States,\" he added.

        "description": "New mainstream card has hardware upgrades but is still stuck with 8GB of RAM. Nvidia will release the GeForce RTX 5060 on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, it would if every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days. Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't been as inflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while.

Nvidia is ramping up the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, unveiling more than 70 research papers showing how the fast-evolving technology can perform in real-world settings that go far beyond text and images. The chip company is advancing what it calls “embodied intelligence,” or AI that can perceive, reason and act in industries including manufacturing, biotechnology and transportation. As Fast Company reported on Monday (May 5), Nvidia sees these capabilities as essential to future breakthroughs in robotics, drug development and autonomous navigation. “For AI to be truly useful, it must engage meaningfully with real-world use cases,” the magazine quoted Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning, as saying. The chip giant presented its company-authored papers, covering healthcare, robotics, autonomous vehicles and large language models, at a major technology conference held in Singapore at the end of last month. Nvidia is continuing its collaborative push into AI that has seen partnerships with Google, GE Healthcare and GM. One paper describes a key development called Skill Reuse via Skill Adaptation (SRSA), a system that enables robotic agents to perform unfamiliar tasks by adapting previously learned skills. Nvidia said the system improved task success by 19% and reduced training sample needs by more than half, helping speed deployment across logistics and industrial robotics. In the biotech sector, the company’s Proteína model trains on 21 million synthetic protein structures to generate long-chain backbones of up to 800 amino acids. Nvidia says the model outperforms Google’s DeepMind’s Genie 2, a cutting-edge AI model, in accuracy and diversity. It says its structure-labeled outputs could accelerate vaccine development and enzyme design. STORM, short for Spatio-Temporal Occupancy Reconstruction Machine, builds 3D maps in under 200 milliseconds — fast enough for use in drones, AR systems and autonomous vehicles navigating complex environments. Aimed at improving reasoning, the company’s Nemotron-MIND teaches large language models how to solve math problems using synthetic dialogue. According to the company, models trained this way outperform larger systems on key benchmarks while using far fewer tokens. Nvidia delivered these announcements at the 2025 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). At the event, the chipmaker also introduced Inference Microservices (NIM) — a deployment platform designed to help firms run advanced AI models without large-scale infrastructure.

Nvidia’s chips are a critical ingredient for creating AI systems such as chatbots, image generators and more specialized ones that can help craft biological weapons. Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have implemented progressively tighter export controls of Nvidia’s chips to China. But Reuters and other news organizations have documented how some of those chips have continued to flow into China, and Nvidia has publicly claimed it cannot track its products after they are sold. U.S. Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois who once worked as a particle physicist, said the technology to track chips after they are sold is readily available, with much of it already built in to Nvidia’s chips. Independent technical experts interviewed by Reuters agreed. Foster, who successfully designed multiple computer chips during his scientific career, plans to introduce in coming weeks a bill that would direct U.S. regulators to come up with rules in two key areas: Tracking chips to ensure they are where they are authorized to be under export control licenses, and preventing those chips from booting up if they are not properly licensed under export controls. Foster told Reuters that there are already credible reports – some of which have not been publicly disclosed – of chip smuggling occurring on a large scale. “This is not an imaginary future problem,” Foster told Reuters. “It is a problem now, and at some point we’re going to discover that the Chinese Communist Party, or their military, is busy designing weapons using large arrays of chips, or even just working on (artificial general intelligence), which is as immediate as nuclear technology.” Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Chip smuggling has taken on new urgency after the emergency of China’s DeepSeek, whose AI systems posed a strong challenge to U.S. systems and were built with Nvidia chips that were prohibited for sale to China, according analyst firm SemiAnalysis. Prosecutors in Singapore have charged three Chinese nationals with fraud in a case that involved servers that may have contained Nvidia chips. Though it has not been put into broad use, the technology to verify the location of chips already exists. Alphabet’s Google already tracks the location of its in-house AI chips and others in its vast network of data centers for security purposes, according to two sources with direct knowledge of its operations. Google did not respond to a request for comment. Foster’s legislation would give the U.S. Department of Commerce six months to come up with regulations to require the technology. Bipartisan support Foster’s bill has support from fellow Democrats such as Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on China. “On-chip location verification is one creative solution we should explore to stop this smuggling,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. Republicans are also supportive, with Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the committee, telling Reuters that “the Select Committee has strong bipartisan support for requiring companies like Nvidia to build location-tracking into their high-powered AI chips — and the technology to do it already exists. The technology for verifying the location of chips would rely on the chips communicating with a secured computer server that would use the length of time it takes for the signal to reach the server to verify where chips are, a concept that relies on knowing that computer signals move at the speed of light. Tim Fist, a former engineer and director of emerging technology policy at Washington think tank Institute for Progress, said such tracking would provide a general, country-level location for chips. But that is far more information than the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department responsible for enforcement of export controls, currently has. “BIS has no idea which chips they should be targeting as a potential high priority to investigate once they’ve gone overseas,” Fist said. With location verification, “they now at least have bucketed the set of chips that are out there in the world into ones that are very likely to not have been smuggled and ones that warrant further investigation.” Foster’s second legislative goal of preventing AI chips from booting up if they are not properly licensed under U.S. export controls would be more technologically complex to implement than location verification, but he said the time has come to begin discussions for both efforts. “We’ve gotten enough input that I think now we can have more detailed discussions with the actual chip and module providers to say, ‘How would you actually implement this?'” Foster told Reuters. —Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "description": "​​Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have centered largely on language and imagery—from chatbots that compose sonnets and analyze text to voice models that mimic human speech and tools that transform prompts into vivid artwork. But global chip giant Nvidia is now making a bolder claim: the next chapter of AI is about systems that take action in high-stakes, real-world scenarios. At the recent International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025) in Singapore, Nvidia unveiled more than 70 research papers showcasing advances in AI systems designed to perform complex tasks beyond the digital realm. Driving this shift are agentic and foundational AI models. Nvidia’s latest research highlights how combining these models can influence the physical world—spanning adaptive robotics, protein design, and real-time reconstruction of dynamic environments for autonomous vehicles. As demand for AI grows across industries, Nvidia is positioning itself as a core infrastructure provider powering this new era of intelligent action. Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at Nvidia, described the company’s new direction as a full-stack AI initiative. “We aim to accelerate every level of the computing stack to amplify the impact and utility of AI across industries,” he tells Fast Company. “For AI to be truly useful, it must evolve beyond traditional applications and engage meaningfully with real-world use cases. That means building systems capable of reasoning, decision-making, and interacting with the real-world environment to solve practical problems.” Among the research presented, four models stood out—one of the most promising being Skill Reuse via Skill Adaptation (SRSA). This AI framework enables robots to handle unfamiliar tasks without retraining from scratch—a longstanding hurdle in robotics. While most robotic AI systems have focused on basic tasks like picking up objects, more complex jobs such as precision assembly on factory lines remain difficult. Nvidia’s SRSA model aims to overcome that challenge by leveraging a library of previously learned skills to help robots adapt more quickly. “When faced with a new challenge, the SRSA approach analyzes which existing skill is most similar to the new task, then adapts and extends it as a foundation for learning,” Catanzaro says. “This brings us a significant step closer to achieving generalization across tasks, something that’s crucial for making robots more flexible and useful in the real world.” To make accurate predictions, the system considers object shapes, movements, and expert strategies for similar tasks. According to one research paper, SRSA improved success rates on unseen tasks by 19% and required 2.4 times fewer training samples than existing methods. “Over time, we expect this kind of self-reflective, adaptive learning to be transformative for industries like manufacturing, logistics, and disaster response—fields where environments are dynamic and robots need to quickly adapt without extensive retraining,” Catanzaro says. Biotech breakthroughs The biotech sector has traditionally lagged in adopting cutting-edge AI, hindered by data scarcity and the opaque nature of many algorithms. Protein design, essential to drug development, is often hampered by proprietary data silos that slow progress and stifle innovation. To address this, Nvidia introduced Proteína—a large-scale generative model for designing entirely new protein backbones. Built using a powerful class of generative models, it can produce longer, more diverse, and functional proteins—up to 800 amino acids in length. Nvidia claims it outperforms models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 2 and Generate Biomedicines’ Chroma, especially in generating large-chain proteins. According to a paper on Proteína, the team trained the model using 21 million high-quality synthetic protein structures and improved learning thanks to new guidance strategies that ensure realistic outputs during generation. This breakthrough could transform enzyme engineering (and, by extension, vaccine development) by enabling researchers to design novel molecules beyond what occurs in nature. “What makes it especially powerful is its ability to generate proteins with specific shapes and properties, guided by structural labels,” Catanzaro says. “This gives scientists an unprecedented level of control over the design process—allowing them to create entirely new molecules tailored for specific purposes, like new medicines or advanced materials.” A new AI tool for autonomous vehicles Another standout from ICLR 2025 is Spatio-Temporal Occupancy Reconstruction Machine (STORM), an AI model capable of reconstructing dynamic 3D environments—like city streets or forest trails—in under 200 milliseconds. With minimal video input, it produces detailed, real-time spatial maps that can inform rapid machine decision-making. Nvidia sees STORM as a tool for autonomous vehicles, drones, and augmented reality systems navigating complex, moving environments. “One of the biggest backlogs in current models is that they often rely heavily on optimization—an iterative process that takes time to refine and produce accurate 3D reconstructions,” says Catanzaro. “STORM tackles this by achieving high-accuracy results in a single pass, significantly speeding up the process without sacrificing quality.” STORM’s potential extends beyond vehicles. Catanzaro envisions applications in consumer tech, such as AR glasses capable of mapping a live sports game in real time—allowing viewers to experience the event as if they were on the field. “STORM’s real-time environmental intelligence moves us closer to a future where machines and devices can perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world as fluidly as humans do,” he says. While STORM is built to help machines understand the physical world in real time, Nvidia is also pushing the boundaries of how large language models reason—through a project called Nemotron-MIND. This 138-billion-token synthetic pretraining data set is designed to enhance both mathematical and general reasoning. At its core is MIND, a new framework that turns raw math-heavy web documents into rich, multi-turn conversations that mirror how humans work through problems together. By turning dense math documents into conversations between people with different levels of understanding, MIND helps AI models break down problems step by step and explain them naturally. This method doesn’t just teach models what the right answer is—it helps them learn how to think through problems like a person would. According to its research paper, a seven-billion-parameter model trained on just four billion tokens of MIND-style dialogue outperformed much larger models trained on traditional data sets. It showed significant gains on key reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K (grade school math), MATH, and MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), and achieved a 2.5 percent boost in general reasoning when integrated into an LLM. Can startups and researchers keep up? Training and deploying advanced AI models requires substantial GPU resources, often out of reach for smaller players. To close this gap, Nvidia is rolling out its next-gen AI models through Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIMs), a suite of containerized, cloud-native tools designed to simplify deployment across different infrastructures. NIM includes prebuilt inference engines for a wide array of models, helping organizations integrate and scale AI with fewer computing resources. “Improving efficiency has always been a major focus for us,” Catanzaro says. “Ultimately, our goal is to democratize access to AI capabilities and make deployment practical at every scale, regardless of their computing resources, to harness the power of AI.” As agentic and foundational AI becomes more capable and more embodied, the future of tech may hinge on how effectively it works with humans. “It’s critical to identify and support use cases across diverse fields,” Catanzaro says.",

        "description": "Nvidia has reportedly criticized Anthropic over its stance on U.S. chip export restrictions. “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters,’” a spokesperson for Nvidia told CNBC Thursday (May 1). Nvidia’s […] The post Nvidia Accuses Anthropic of Spinning ‘Tall Tales’ About Chip Restrictions appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Nvidia has reportedly criticized Anthropic over its stance on U.S. chip export restrictions. “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters,’” a spokesperson for Nvidia told CNBC Thursday (May 1). Nvidia’s comments refer to a recent blog post by artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, which accused China of engaging in the above-mentioned smuggling tactics. “The first Trump Administration correctly diagnosed that AI will be central to strategic competition with China, and that the United States can and should use export controls to maintain and strengthen its AI leadership,” Anthropic wrote. “While the U.S. still maintains a lead in AI development, Chinese AI labs like DeepSeek have made significant progress, using chips obtained before export controls went into effect, and underscore the importance of strong export controls on advanced chips.” As CNBC noted, the chip restrictions were set during the final days of President Joe Biden’s tenure and are set to go into effect May 15. These limits, known as the “Diffusion Rule,” are designed to place export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent countries like China from advancing in the AI race. “To enhance U.S. national security and economic strength, it is essential that we do not offshore this critical technology and that the world’s AI runs on American rails,” the Biden administration said at the time. “It is important to work with AI companies and foreign governments to put in place critical security and trust standards as they build out their AI ecosystems.” President Donald Trump, the CNBC report added, is working on revising these restrictions, bringing additional uncertainty to an already contentious rule. A group of Senate Republicans last month wrote to the White House asking Trump to rescind his predecessor’s rule, saying it could hinder domestic innovation and disrupt existing international partnerships. ”Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained,” the group’s letter said. Anthropic wants the government to impose greater restrictions on imports, something that could curb Nvidia’s revenue. “China, with half of the world’s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack. America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI,” the spokesperson told CNBC.

The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly.A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide.Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday.Elon MuskNet worth on January 20: $449 billionNet worth on April 28: $335 billionLoss: $114 billionMusk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person.Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year.After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government.Jeff BezosNet worth on January 20: $245 billionNet worth on April 28: $209 billionLoss: $36 billionBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February.Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country.Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site.Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk were among the tech leaders who supported Trump's inauguration.JULIA DEMAREE NIKHINSON/POOL/AFP via Getty ImagesMark ZuckerbergNet worth on January 20: $217 billionNet worth on April 28: $195 billionLoss: $22 billionZuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election. Trump had repeatedly lashed out against the Meta CEO on Truth Social and suggested he should be investigated or jailed after Facebook temporarily banned Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot.Meta, the primary source of Zuckerberg's wealth, has been fighting an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the government that has not gone away under Trump. Zuckerberg earlier this month sat for three days of testimony after the antitrust trial opened.The Meta CEO testified for more than 10 hours and was grilled by the FTC's lead attorney.Jensen HuangNet worth on January 20: $117 billionNet worth on April 28: $95.4 billionLoss: $21.6 billionWhile Huang did not attend the inauguration, Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural fund�. Huang's wealth, a majority of which is tied to Nvidia stock, has also dropped since January, when he attended the inauguration.Nvidia stock has fallen over 21% year to date, with the company facing several setbacks that include Trump's tariffs, as the company sources a majority of its chips from overseas, primarily Taiwan.The company also said earlier this month it expected to take a $5.5 billion hit on its first-quarter earnings as a result of the Trump administration's restrictions on its chip exports to China.Tech leaders also saw stock declines for the companies they leadOther tech leaders who attended the inauguration saw declines in the stock prices of the companies they lead, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.Though some estimates suggest the CEOs are billionaires, they are not on Bloomberg's list of the top 500 richest people, so the change in their estimated net worth since the inauguration was not publicly available.But Apple's share price has fallen nearly 14% this year, while the share price of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has fallen nearly 15% year over year.Read the original article on Business Insider Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang have lost a collective $192 billion in wealth since Inauguration Day.Win McNamee/Getty Images; Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images; Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images; Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSeveral tech billionaires attended or donated to Trump's inauguration in January.Four of the richest have lost a collective $194 billion in wealth since Trump took office.Tech leaders who attend Trump's inauguration have also seen declines in their company's share price.It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side.Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund.

London-based artificial intelligence infrastructure startup Nscale reportedly aims to raise $2.7 billion to build data centers around the globe that use Nvidia chips and rent the centers to companies that are training and operating AI models. Nscale is working to raise a $1.8 billion private credit deal and $900 million in preferred equity and convertible shares, Bloomberg reported Monday (April 28), citing an offering document. An Nscale spokesperson said in the report: “We recognize that increasing demand for AI and keen interest in our rapidly evolving industry is generating a lot of attention for Nscale, but we do not comment on speculation.” Nscale has facilities in Norway and Texas and plans to build five more sites, according to the Bloomberg report. The firm said in December that it raised $155 million in a Series A funding round to accelerate the expansion of its AI infrastructure and meet “soaring demand” for AI compute. That followed its $30 million seed funding round in December 2023. “The AI market is scaling rapidly, and so are we,” Nscale CEO Joshua Payne said in a Dec. 9 press release. Payne said the company “manages every layer of infrastructure in the value chain to meet the intensive needs of large-scale AI customers” and highlighted its access to the electricity required to power these GPU superclusters. Research institute Epoch AI said in a paper posted Wednesday (April 23) that companies building AI-powered supercomputers may run into power constraints by 2030. “If the observed trends continue, the leading AI supercomputer in June 2030 will need 2 million AI chips, cost $200 billion and require 9GW of power,” the paper said. “Historical AI chip production growth and major capital commitments like the $500 billion Project Stargate suggest the first two requirements can likely be met. However, 9GW of power is the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors, a scale beyond any existing industrial facilities.” It was reported in March that AI startup and cloud computing provider CoreWeave scaled back its initial public offering (IPO) from about $4 billion to $2.7 billion due to a broader stock market slump resulting from increased volatility.

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen HuangJOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty ImagesHardware, software, and models are constantly evolving in AI.When tech becomes obsolete, developers say it's often best to 'burn the boats,' or trash it.The idea is a mindset shift for big enterprises, but it could be essential for AI success.It's not uncommon for AI companies to fear that Nvidia will swoop in and make their work redundant. But when it happened to Tuhin Srivastava, he was perfectly calm.\"This is the thing about AI — you gotta burn the boats,\" Srivastava, the cofounder of AI inference platform Baseten, told Business Insider. He hasn't burned his quite yet, but he's bought the kerosene.The story goes back to when DeepSeek took the AI world by storm at the beginning of this year. Srivastava and his team had been working with the model for weeks, but it was a struggle.The problem was a tangle of AI jargon, but essentially, inference, the computing process that happens when AI generates outputs, needed to be scaled up to quickly run these big, complicated, reasoning models.

But when it happened to Tuhin Srivastava, he was perfectly calm.\"This is the thing about AI — you gotta burn the boats,\" Srivastava, the cofounder of AI inference platform Baseten, told Business Insider. He hasn't burned his quite yet, but he's bought the kerosene.The story goes back to when DeepSeek took the AI world by storm at the beginning of this year. Srivastava and his team had been working with the model for weeks, but it was a struggle.The problem was a tangle of AI jargon, but essentially, inference, the computing process that happens when AI generates outputs, needed to be scaled up to quickly run these big, complicated, reasoning models. Multiple elements were hitting bottlenecks and slowing down delivery of the model responses, making it a lot less useful for Baseten's customers, who were clamoring for access to the model.Srivastava's company has access to Nvidia's H200 chips — the best, widely available chip that could handle the advanced model at the time — but Nvidia's inference platform was glitching.

The company's three co-founders, Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky met at a Silicon Valley area Denny's restaurant to discuss leaving their current roles and forming a new company.At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were both working for Sun Microsystems. Malachowsky had also been employed by Hewlett-Packard, and at both companies he held leading positions as a software and hardware engineer, per his Nvidia bio.But before Malachowsky became one of the most influential engineers in the world of computing, he was on a very different path in life.Education and early careerMalachowsky was born in the spring of 1959. By the time he entered college in the late 1970s, he was on track to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor, he said in an interview at the University of Southern Florida.In the course of his pre-med studies, Malachowsky came to learn two things: firstly, he did not want to be a doctor, after all. And secondly, he was enthralled by engineering.Malachowsky pivoted, and would receive a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1983, followed by a master's degree in the same field three years later.And within less than a decade, Malachowsky would be there at that Denny's discussing the founding of a company that would become a dominant global player and one of the most valuable companies in the world, alongside Apple and Microsoft.Nvidia career and creation of the GPUWhen Malachowsky, Huang, and Priem founded Nvidia (Priem left the company in the early 2000s), the men knew they wanted to focus on graphics, then a rapidly developing field of computing.Their primary focus was on developing better and better graphics processing abilities for video games, but the Nvidia team clearly grasped that graphics applications went well beyond the gaming world.In 1999, two big things happened for Nvidia: the company went public, and the company released the world's first GPU, or graphics processing unit. Malachowsky was the chief architect of the GPU, or graphics processing unit.GPUs enable computers to process graphics and images with much greater speed and precision than previous types of processors could handle. They have been instrumental not only in enhancing the gaming experience, but also have applications in 3D technology, AI, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, and much more.Malachowsky remains at Nvidia as a senior technology executive.Beyond NvidiaWe know that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth is more than $113 billion, putting him in the rarified category of the centibillionaire. While Chris Malachowky's net worth is not publicly known, we do know plenty more.For example, Malachowsky holds around three-dozen patents, according to the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame, including many related to computer graphics and processing.We also know that beyond his two earned degrees, Malachowsky also holds honorary doctorates from the University of Silicon Valley and the University of Florida.His talents also extend beyond the tech world into the arts.

        "description": "\"The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips,\" Morgan Stanley said. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks to a robot at the company's AI conference.JOSH EDELSON / AFPThe stock market's AI trade has waned this year amid tariffs and fears of an AI slowdin. But Morgan Stanley dismissed concerns of lower AI spending, citing continued demand for chips.\"We have been highlighting this strong inference demand recently but it continues to get stronger,\" Morgan Stanley said.One of Wall Street's top banks isn't worried about the artificial intelligence trade even as it struggles amid fears of lower investment by companies in 2025. \"The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note on Friday.Moore pointed to recent comments from OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai as evidence that AI companies still can't get enough GPU chips.\"While Wall Street wrings its hands over a laundry list of very real concerns, Silicon Valley focus has shifted to a very different challenge - growth in tokens generated of more than 5x since the beginning of the year is very much stressing the ecosystem, and is driving a surge in investment to handle those workloads,\" Moore explained.AI stocks have been particularly weak this year, a trend sparked by the late-January debut of DeepSeek's efficient large language model. The model sparked fears that cloud hyperscalers might need fewer GPU chips from Nvidia to develop their AI capabilities.The AI bubble fears grew after President Donald Trump unleashed a wave of tariffs in early April.Shares of AI darling Nvidia have plunged 28% since late January, and mega-cap tech giants closely tied to the AI trade are down about 21% since their peak just a few months ago.Turning to Nvidia, Moore admitted that supply constraints and export restrictions on its H20 chips would likely limit the company's revenue upside over the next few quarters. Still, once supply constraints are worked out, they should see a significant leg of growth in 2026.\"NVIDIA had almost no revenue for Blackwell in October, did $11 bn in January, and likely well over $30 bn in the current quarter,\" Moore said, adding that he doesn't expect the growth to slow down. anytime soon.\"Per our checks, this demand commentary has intensified in the last few days,\" Moore said. \"We have been highlighting this strong inference demand recently but it continues to get stronger.\"Moore increased his calendar year 2026 revenue and earnings per share estimates for Nvidia by 10.7% and 11.9%, respectively, adding that the chip giant remains a \"top pick.\"The analyst reiterated his \"Overweight\" rating on Nvidia and set a $160 price target, representing potential upside of 45% from current levels.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Analysts widely interpreted the license requirement as an export ban.The US chip firm said it would incur $5.5 billion in charges related to inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves for its H20 chip model in the first quarter, which ends on April 27.Nvidia designed its H20 chip to exactly fit with Biden administration limits on the power of chips that could be sold to Chinese companies, the aim of which was to curb China's AI progress. (A new congressional inquiry takes issue with this reaction to the regulations.)\"Banning the H20 would make no sense as its performance is already well below Chinese alternatives; a ban would simply hand the Chinese AI market completely over to Huawei,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.How Chinese AI progressed despite chip limitsChinese companies have been reducing their reliance on Nvidia chips, according to the analysts. To do so they have found ways to perform model training on unrestricted edge devices, like personal computers and laptops. They've also moved much of the inference workloads, the AI-generated responses and actions, to Nvidia alternatives.Chinese companies have also engineered ways for chips designed by their homegrown tech giant, Huawei, or other locally made chips, and Nvidia chips to be networked together, though software remains a challenge in fully converting from chip to chip.\"Our channel checks have shown that most companies are able to carry on without H20 chips,\" the analysts wrote.Chinese companies with revenue from foundation model subscriptions — similar to US firms OpenAI or Anthropic — will have the hardest time converting from Nvidia chips to alternatives, since training models is more dependent on Nvidia's proprietary software CUDA.One Chinese company required 200 engineers and six months to move a model from the Nvidia platform to Huawei chips, and it still only reached 90% of the previous performance, according to Bernstein.Huawei presents the most formidable challenge to Nvidia in China.\"In the longer run, expect Huawei to keep closing the gap in performance and Chinese foundational models making up for compute deficiency with Deepseek-like innovation,\" the analysts wrote.Chip supply, though, is likely to be constrained for the foreseeable future, they added, as Huawei, like most major players in the AI chips game, is somewhat dependent on production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.Read the original article on Business Insider Tingshu Wang/ReutersBanning Nvidia chips won't halt China's AI progress, analysts say.Chinese firms are reducing reliance on Nvidia, finding alternatives like Huawei.Banning H20 chip exports would 'make no sense,' according to Bernstein.Banning the export of Nvidia chips is unlikely to stymie China's development of advanced AI, according to Bernstein analysts.Nvidia notified investors in a new regulatory filing last week that it expects the Trump administration to require a license for exporting the type of powerful semiconductors used to build AI products to China.

        "description": "Nvidia and other semiconductor stocks could see even deeper sell-offs this year if geopolitical tensions worsen, according to BCA Research. Tanaonte/Getty ImagesThe sell-off for semiconductor stocks might not be over, according to BCA Research.Rising geopolitical risk between the US and China could seriously tank Nvidia share prices.Here's how to protect your holdings from an escalating trade war.It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year.If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan.In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%.How a US-China war could play outWhile most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released.\"President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing,\" Papic and Gertken wrote. \"That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade.\"Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy.BCA ResearchEd Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\"The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers,\" Yardeni wrote in a note last week. \"President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy.\"BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months.Semiconductors at riskTaiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies.In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed \"WWIII,\" expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor.\"Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification,\" Papic and Gertken wrote.In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500.How to prepareInvestors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe.\"Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event,\" wrote Papic and Gertken. \"For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices.\"As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap.In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said.\"Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap,\" they wrote.Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE).Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU).Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks to a robot at the company's AI conference.JOSH EDELSON / AFPNvidia has a reputation for a demanding work culture.Yet the company has stayed relatively flexible as other tech firms return-to-office and cut perks.Huang's fast pace, long days, and streamlined 5-point emails help to maintain accountability.Nvidia doesn't need a big cultural shift to get workers to be hardcore. They've been there for years.Companies like Shopify, Microsoft, and Meta are ramping up the intensity for workers, pushing the need to get ahead in AI and drive efficiency. The shift inside tech companies has led to cullings of so-called \"low performers\", inflexible return-to-office mandates, and a reduction in perks.Nvidia's staff has grown immensely in the last few years, and market capitalization is on a wild roller coaster ride, but the tentpoles of the company's culture go back much farther than the AI boom. The company, and Huang himself, are also the subject of two new books, released in the last four months, which corroborate what former Nvidians have told Business Insider.Nvidia has a demanding work culture that trickles down from its famous CEO, Jensen Huang, providing a foil for the tech firms that aspire to be hardcore, but do so by fiat.\"Basically, every single person in Nvidia is directly accountable to Jensen,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip.\"Nvidia declined to comment on this report.'The mission is the boss.'Nvidia has an extremely horizontal structure, with dozens of people — around 60 — reporting directly to CEO Jensen Huang.Huang sets the direction and the goal, but the Santa Clara, California-based company also has a defining mantra: \"The mission is the boss,\" author Tae Kim wrote in his book \"The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant.\"Nvidia shies away from short-term goals, Kim said. There is a central goal or mission, but planning and strategizing are constant processes that don't focus on management incentives or satisfying a hierarchy.Project leaders may suddenly find themselves reporting directly to Huang. These newly anointed direct reports are dubbed \"pilots in charge\" and are subject to his wrath and carry his weight, Kim said.According to a former Nvidia employee who asked to remain anonymous to discuss internal matters, everyone in the company must be prepared to answer Huang in detail.\"His ability to track small details across countless projects is incredible,\" a former director told BI.This method of extreme accountability means Nvidia hasn't had to rein in employees as many other companies have post-pandemic. Nvidia is still remote-friendly, for example. But meetings are far from relaxing.Huang is known to publicly discuss failures and disagreements to benefit the group rather than spare feelings. If he suspects someone isn't on top of their work, a public, cross-examination may ensue. Perks are few, but that's always been the case, two former Nvidians told BI.The \"mission is boss\" ethos helps Nvidia avoid the pitfalls of large firms, which often struggle to make quick decisions, let alone pivot when needed, Kim wrote.\"Jensen really doesn't tolerate bullshit,\" a former engineer from Nvidia's early days told BI. This intolerance makes playing politics nearly impossible, they said.\"It's not just, 'You did something wrong.' It's, 'You did something wrong that was self-serving' — that's the typical problem in big companies,\" they said.The philosophy is that the mission can change, but as long as everyone serves it rather than their manager, the company should thrive. Nvidia's pivot to focus on machine learning was even communicated in a companywide Friday-night email in 2014. By Monday, Nvidia was an AI company, Witt wrote.Email accountabilityHuang is known to send more than 100 emails a day, which brings another Jensen-ism into play. (Kim's book has an entire appendix of \"Jensen-isms\")The 62-year-old CEO often refers to Nvidia's modus operandi as \"speed of light.\" That's how fast Huang wants everything at Nvidia to progress. He's publicly used the phrase to refer to everything from hiring processes to fixing technical problems.Witt thinks that Nvidia's email culture was possibly an inspiration for a memorable moment from the early days of DOGE. On a Saturday, Elon Musk requested that every federal government employee send a five-point email recounting what they had done that week. Jensen Huang has requested these emails from his staff since 2020.According to Kim, at least 100 of Huang's daily diet of emails are \"top five\" emails.'Nowhere to hide'The irony in Nvidia's position among the Silicon Valley elite is that the \"mission is boss\" mentality and the constant email status updates mean a lot of Nvidians have flexibility that most of Big Tech, including Nvidia's largest customers, have abandoned in 2025.The hours can be long at Nvidia, which also stems from Huang. Sixty-hour weeks are the norm, and 80-hour weeks are likely at crucial times, offering contrast to companies that feel the need to delineate exact office hours.\"I don't even know when Jensen sleeps,\" another former Nvidia director said.Many Nvidians are still able to work from wherever they like. The reason is two-fold, Witt said.\"One of the reasons he's so big on work-from-home is because it gives women, and especially young mothers, the opportunity to continue their work without their careers getting interrupted,\" Witt said.Inspired by his wife, Lori Huang, a brilliant electrical engineer who dropped out of the workforce after becoming a mother of two, Huang is aware that some valuable engineering brains find balancing work and family difficult.\"It works really well at Nvidia,\" Witt said. \"You know if you're dropping the ball at Nvidia, the spotlight is turning directly at you, more or less instantly. There is nowhere to hide if you are shirking your work at Nvidia, and I think that makes work-from-home work better for them.\"Nvidia for lifeIf there's one hallmark of the new era of hardcore tech culture, it's layoffs. Rolling layoffs are constantly whirring in the background of tech workplaces in 2025.That's where Nvidia fully diverges from the pack.The company hasn't had layoffs since 2008, and despite the hard-charging atmosphere rife with accountability, the turnover at the company is minuscule — under 5% annually for the past two years.Witt said that's in part due to a self-selection dynamic. Engineers who like a no-nonsense atmosphere where technological supremacy is the focus naturally gravitate toward the company.\"He can get these guys to work for Nvidia on little more than a dream, but those guys will do it because they know the circuits, they know the technology. And they know that Jensen's always at the cutting edge, even if it's not making money. They'll do anything to be at the cutting edge,\" Witt told BI.But another reason many Nvidians spend decades with the company could come from Huang's competitive anxiety.\"When Nvidia is evaluating an engineer, they won't think just about what they're worth. They'll think about what it's worth to keep that person away from the competition,\" Witt said.Huang, though, has offered a different explanation.\"I don't like giving up on people because I think that they could improve,\" Huang said at a Stripe event last year. \"It's kind of tongue in cheek, but people know that I'd rather torture them into greatness.\"Have a tip or an insight to share?

The post Chip Industry Week In Review appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. TSMC said it will produce 30% of its leading-edge chips in Arizona when all six of its fabs are operational, a total investment of $165 billion, Axios reported. In its latest SEC filing, the foundry said it continues to add capacity in Taiwan, Arizona, Japan, and Germany. The Trump administration launched a Section 232 investigation into semiconductors and related equipment to determine if tariffs or other measures are needed to protect national security. The administration also clarified late last week that, at least for now, smartphones, computers and other devices are excluded from reciprocal tariffs. The latest U.S. export license requirements now include Nvidia’s H20 products and AMD‘s MI308 products, leading both companies to issue SEC filings with Nvidia forecasting $5.5 billion in charges and AMD projecting up to $800 million in related costs. CSIS weighed in on semiconductor export restrictions’ chances of success in its recent commentary, The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China Challenge. China’s recent export restrictions on seven rare earth elements and magnets has a significant impact to national security, according to CSIS. Those elements are used in defense technologies, radar, EVs, wireless technology, and more. China currently has an effective monopoly over the supply. Latest financial updates: TSMC posted +US$25 billion in Q1 revenue, up ~35% (in USD) compared with last year. The company maintained an upbeat 2025 full-year forecast despite the trade war, and refuted rumors about a joint venture with Intel. ASML issued its Q1 earnings announcement this week, which was in line with guidance, but CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that “the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while.” Find the latest chip industry stock results here. AMD taped out its Venice processor, manufactured using TSMC’s 2nm (N2) process technology. Nvidia is designing and plans to build up to $500 billion of U.S. AI supercomputing factories over the next four years through partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor and SPIL. Deals: Cadence will acquire Arm’s Artisan foundation IP business, consisting of standard cell libraries, memory compilers, and general-purpose I/Os optimized for advanced process nodes. The deal, which brings foundation IP into Cadence’s broader IP portfolio, is expected to close in Q3 2025. Intel will sell 51% of Altera to investment firm Silver Lake in a deal that values the FPGA maker at $8.75 billion. Intel will retain the remaining 49% stake. Intel acquired Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion. Raghib Hussain, previously president of products and technologies at Marvell, will take over as Altera’s new CEO. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025. JEDEC published the latest high-bandwidth memory (HBM) standard. HBM4 increases transfer speeds up to 8 Gb/s across a 2,048-bit interface, boosting total bandwidth up to 2 TB/s. It also doubles the number of independent channels per stack to provide access flexibility. Cadence, meanwhile, announced HBM4 12.8Gbps memory IP, compatible with the new JEDEC spec, with 20% greater power efficiency per bit, 50% better area efficiency, and twice as many I/Os.

        "description": "Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week here. Nvidia gets burned by Trump on China chips Silicon Valley magnates fell over themselves to placate and appease President Donald Trump. Nvidia just found out why that’s no guarantee of success. The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday that the Trump administration will now require a license for the company to sell its H20 chips—the most powerful GPUs still legal for export—to Chinese companies. Nvidia says it will take a $5.5 billion charge in its April quarter earnings reflecting a belief that the license is a permanent requirement and that it has little chance of getting one. With its market cap already down 20% this year, the company watched its shares plunge another 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The license requirement comes after Nvidia had already made overtures toward Trump. CEO Jensen Huang recently dined with the president at Mar-a-Lago and has reportedly pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new U.S. data centers. Following the Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR reported that the White House had backed off a plan to restrict the H20 chips. But in the end that wasn’t enough to prevent the administration from effectively banning the H20 and gouging out a big chunk of Nvidia’s revenues. “We lower our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia to $125 from $130 as we cut our revenue estimates to exclude China now and in the future,” Morningstar strategist Brian Colello wrote in an investor brief on Wednesday. “We retain our Very High Uncertainty Rating. Shares appear undervalued to us, as tariff concerns are likely weighing on the stock.” You can almost see the shrugged-shoulders emoji next to Colello’s words: Nvidia’s investor downgrade has nothing to do with real demand for its products, which remains very high. The administration claims the export controls stem from national security concerns—that H20 chips would pose a threat should Beijing get control of them. But more likely, Trump recognizes Nvidia’s central role in the generative AI boom, and seized on the company’s success as a chess piece in his grudge match against China. The move comes as Chinese AI companies are pulling ahead of their American counterparts in areas like self-driving cars and robotics, and are within striking distance of surpassing the U.S. in frontier model development. Many D.C. and Silicon Valley insiders will applaud the H20 restrictions. After all, they feed the defense sector’s push to bulk up for a military conflict with China (perhaps around Taiwan), and may even slow China’s considerable momentum in AI research. But this zero-sum, winner-take-all approach may have its downsides, too. Chinese company DeepSeek, for example, was spurred to some impressive AI innovation precisely because it was denied top-tier chips from U.S. competitors. And, as the pundit Thomas Friedman pointed out on The Ezra Klein Show, this century’s biggest problems—the environment and AI safety—are world problems that will require cooperation and openness between the world’s two superpowers. And it’s not just Nvidia. Mark Zuckerberg is learning the same lesson: that Trump’s loyalty can often seem transactional at best. The Meta CEO is this week being grilled in the witness chair of a government anti-trust action that could break up his company. Trump has an obedient, all-GOP commission, and yet he’s done nothing to stop the case. This after Zuckerberg and company gave $2 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, stood behind Trump at the inauguration, bent the knee at Mar-a-Lago and the White House a number of times, abandoned fact-checking on his social platform, promoted longtime Republicans to high positions within Meta, and discontinued DEI programs at the company. Zuckerberg offered the Federal Trade Commission $450 million, then $1 billion, to keep the case from going to trial, but FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson balked at the numbers and kept the court date. Trump didn’t intervene. My guess is that all these tech honchos will eventually learn, in one way or another, what so many others have—the giant black sucking hole that is Donald Trump’s ego simply can’t be appeased. OpenAI releases its newest reasoning model, o3 OpenAI on Wednesday unveiled its next flagship reasoning model, called o3. As the second generation of OpenAI’s “thinking” models, o3 can quickly gather contextual data and follow multiple reasoning paths to a correct answer—all in real time in response to a user prompt. OpenAI says the new o3 model outperforms the o1 series in every respect and will replace it. A key advance lies in o3’s ability to use external tools to arrive at sound answers. For instance, it might review all the published papers on a specific research problem before crafting its own novel answer, or reason over the contents of an uploaded image. “The combined power of state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks,” OpenAI said in a blog post published Wednesday. According to OpenAI, the o3 model earned state-of-the-art status atop the Codeforces (coding skill), SWE-bench (software engineering skill), and MMMU (visual and textual reasoning skill) benchmark tests. OpenAI says it used 10 times more computing power to train the o3 model than the o1, utilizing new reinforcement learning that incorporates either human or synthetic feedback to improve the quality of its answers. “To me the magic is that under the hood it’s still just next-token prediction,” OpenAI President Greg Brockman said during a livestreamed demo Wednesday. “We’ve changed the objective, changed where the data comes from, and now we’re able to really hook it up to the world.” Alongside o3, OpenAI also released a smaller, faster, and more budget-friendly reasoning model called o4-mini, which the company says excels in math, coding, and visual tasks. In addition, the company introduced Codex CLI, a desktop coding assistant that is powered by the o3 and o4-mini models. A “vibe shift” in the way enterprises are talking about AI and the workforce When corporate executives say AI will usher in a new age of efficiency, what exactly do they mean? At first blush, it sounds like an opportunity to cut down on labor costs (personnel-related headaches). But the truth is more complicated. Over the past year, people in both the corporate and technology worlds have been quick to stress that AI will assist human workers, not replace them. And that narrative has been picked up by people at the management level, as a new survey from Beautiful.ai seems to suggest. The firm, which sells an AI presentation builder, surveyed 3,000 managers and found that as AI tool use in the workplace rises, most doubt that AI can or should replace human workers. The percentage who said their teams wouldn’t function well if some humans were replaced by AI rose 20% over last year’s survey, to 63% of respondents. And only 30% think replacing staff with AI would be financially beneficial—down 17% from 2024. Meanwhile, 65% say employee resistance to AI remains a top concern. It’s hard to say how much these managers are simply parroting the PR du jour to a surveyor. But it does raise the concern that as real workers begin to gain experience with AI tools, confidence in their potential for actually altering workflows doesn’t seem to be growing. Meanwhile, a survey by HR software provider G-P finds that 67% of U.S. executives remain willing to cut headcount and use AI to become 50% more productive.

John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois — said it appeared DeepSeek, which released a powerful AI model that made headlines in January, had used 60,000 chips from Nvidia despite US sanctions limiting the ability of the company to sell some of its hardware to China.Nvidia is already having a tough week. Its stock fell nearly 7% on Wednesday after the company announced that it had been informed that the Trump administration would require a new license for all accelerated chips shipping to China. The company said it expected a $5.5 billion decrease in earnings due to the Trump administration's tariffs.DeepSeek and a representative for Moolenaar did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider about the report.\"DeepSeek isn't just another AI app — it's a weapon in the Chinese Communist Party's arsenal, designed to spy on Americans, steal our technology, and subvert US law,\" Moolenaar said in a statement, which called DeepSeek a \"serious national security threat\" to the US.The lawmakers said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang directed the design of chips to get around US export controls. They also sent a letter to Huang requesting lists of customers located in China and Southeast Asia and any communications between Nvidia and DeepSeek.Nvidia said in a statement to Business Insider that \"the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter.\"The company also said it sells its products to companies worldwide, adding that its reported Singapore revenue indicates the billing addresses of its clients, many of which the company said are subsidiaries of US companies. \"The associated products are shipped to other locations, including the United States and Taiwan, not to China,\" the statement said.The lawmakers' report also found it was likely DeepSeek had deployed methods to copy leading AI models from US companies, violating those companies' terms of service. OpenAI told lawmakers \"DeepSeek employees circumvented guardrails in OpenAI's models\" to accelerate the development of its own models at a lower cost, according to the report.OpenAI said in January it was investigating if DeepSeek used the outputs of its AI models to \"inappropriately\" train its own models.The report also found that 85% of responses from DeepSeek models purposefully suppress content related to democracy, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and human rights, the statement said.The recommendations in the report include increasing the effectiveness of US export control policy and further restricting China's ability to develop and deploy advanced AI models by expanding export controls on chips.They also encourage Congress to consider requiring that chips companies track the eventual user of their products, not just the purchaser.Read the original article on Business Insider US lawmakers are looking into how DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesUS lawmakers are looking into how DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips despite export controls.They also accused DeepSeek of funneling American user data to the Chinese government.The lawmakers urged stricter export controls to limit China's AI advancements and data access.US lawmakers are looking into how advanced Nvidia chips may have gotten into the hands of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which they also accused of spying on Americans on behalf of China.House Representatives released a report on Wednesday that they said \"reveals that DeepSeek covertly funnels American user data to the Chinese Communist Party, manipulates information to align with CCP propaganda, and was trained using material unlawfully obtained from US AI models.\" The lawmakers — Reps.

Fallon for AFP via Getty ImagesNvidia faces new export license rules for selling chips to China and other countries.The Trump administration's decision could impact Nvidia's revenue. Its stock sank Wednesday.Analysts predict this move by the Trump administration could bring better news in the near future.Wall Street analysts had some choice words for the latest shake-up to Nvidia's regulatory landscape — \"disruptive,\" \"surprise,\" and \"abrupt,\" just to name a few. Bernstein analysts went so far as to say \"The Trump rug remains in full effect.\"New rules regarding Nvidia's Chinese business surprised many company stakeholders this week. On Tuesday, after market close, the company announced that it had been informed that the Trump administration would require a new license for all accelerated chips shipping to China and a small group of other countries including Russia.Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves in the first quarter, which ends on April 27.\"Based on our discussions, this is effectively a ban,\" wrote UBS analysts in a note to investors Tuesday.Even those analysts unwilling to read the disclosure as a full-on ban said any licensing process is likely to be lengthy, so revenue from Nvidia's H20 chip, the one the company designed specifically to meet Biden-era export restrictions, is expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future.\"This is not a ban; it's a licensing requirement, but again, the inventory write-down suggests that the company is not optimistic about being granted licenses,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.At the time of writing, the regulation has not appeared in the Federal Register or the Department of Commerce website, so all analyst reactions are related to Nvidia's disclosure. The company's stock was down more than 7% from Tuesday to Wednesday market close.A spokesperson from Nvidia declined to comment.China chips are big money for NvidiaNvidia priced the charges it will likely incur in the first quarter (ending April 27) at $5.5 billion. However, there was no warning about the company's first-quarter results, which will be announced on May 28. Though China sales will almost certainly be lower than expected, several analysts expect the company may still be able to meet revenue targets for the first quarter.\"Given the strong demand for H200 chips since DeepSeek's launch, we think NVDA could offset somewhat lost China H20 revenues,\" BNP Paribas analysts wrote. The same analysts estimated Nvidia's China data center business constitutes 10% to 12% of Nvidia's total revenue.UBS suggested earnings per share would fall by 20 cents, and Morgan Stanley analysts expect 8% to 9% of data center revenues to disappear in the near term.A decrease in ongoing sales to China was already expected.Restrictions on what the company is allowed to sell to China are not new. Hence the company has attempted to reduce its reliance on that market over the last two years. Since the H20 is only relevant to the Chinese market, oversupply won't affect Nvidia's sales of any other chips, Morgan Stanley wrote.Bigger decisions down the roadSince Nvidia's chips are the most expensive in existence, and buyers still keep lining up, tariffs are less of a concern than export restrictions, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Beyond the Chinese market, there are bigger potential impacts looming.The Biden administration's AI diffusion rules are set to go into effect next month — and could have an even more material impact on Nvidia if enacted as is, since they restrict exports to many more countries such as Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, UAE, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and India.Since the White House and Nvidia have demonstrated some cooperation this week, with the Trump administration celebrating the company's announcements around expanded US manufacturing, analysts have converged around a theory about what comes next.\"We are optimistic that the company's demonstrably good relationship with the government, as Trump tweeted yesterday, will mitigate these concerns,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen HuangPatrick T.

        "description": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of a \"challenging scenario\" sparked by the Trump administration's tariff policies if they're fully enacted. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesStocks fell as a pair of warnings from Nvidia and the Federal hit investor confidence.Nvidia's forecasted $5.5 billion earnings hit and export restrictions led to tech-sector declines.Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell extended losses by warning of tariff-driven stagflation risk.Stocks tanked on Wednesday as investors digested a double whammy of tariff-related warnings from Nvidia and the Federal Reserve.Here's where indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET close:S&P 500: 5,275.72, down 2.2%.Dow Jones Industrial Average: 39,669.39, down 1.7% (down 700 points).Nasdaq composite: 16,307.16, down 3.1%.Nvidia's tariff warningThe initial decline on Wednesday was sparked by a surprise disclosure from Nvidia that it expects to take a $5.5 billion hit to earnings in its first quarter.Nvidia's massive charge-off stems from its H20 AI chips, which were developed specifically for the Chinese market. Nvidia said the US government imposed export restrictions on the chips, leaving Nvidia holding the inventory with nowhere to sell it.That news sparked an initial 7% decline in Nvidia shares and dragged the rest of the technology sector lower. The stock extended its decline to as much as 10%, testing the $100 level.It didn't help that ASML, a key player in the semiconductor supply chain, reported earnings that missed analyst estimates.A tariff wake-up call from Jerome PowellBut the losses intensified after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at the Economic Club of Chicago.Powell warned of a \"challenging scenario\" sparked by the Trump administration's tariff policies if they are fully enacted.In this scenario, the Fed's dual-mandate goals of low unemployment and stable prices \"are in tension.\"That could happen if the economy weakens because of the tariffs while prices rise because companies pass the tariff costs along to consumers. In other words, stagflation.It would mean that while the Fed would be inclined to cut interest rates to help stimulate the economy, it might be handcuffed if inflation is surging.Powell acknowledged the potential pain ahead for consumers.\"We understand that elevated levels of unemployment or inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and businesses,\" he said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The new rules are part of Washington's efforts to limit China's semiconductor and artificial intelligence ambitions, and are seen as an escalation of the tech battle between the US and China. The restrictions will impact Nvidia's revenue, with estimated writedowns of $5.5 billion, and may also affect other chipmakers, including AMD, Samsung, and SK Hynix.

        "description": "\"The stock has become a victim of its own success,\" Bespoke's Paul Hickey told Business Insider. Josh Edelson / AFPNvidia stock fell as much as 7% on Wednesday amid tariff pressure from President Trump.The stock is now down 20% this year, and faces a rocky road ahead.Shares are in a tough position as a lightning rod for all of the market's assorted headwinds.Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year.One thing after another seems to be knocking shares lower. If the pressure isn't coming from competing Chinese AI models, it's being applied by President Trump as he announces more tariffs on Nvidia-adjacent industries.And that's not to mention the stock's status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a headlining member of the vaunted Magnificent 7. Its rapid increase over the past few years has only been rivaled by the major declines it experiences during times of market turbulence.Nvidia's rocky year continued on Wednesday as shares fell as much as 7% after the company said that it expects to take a $5.5 billion earnings hit because of Chinese tariffs levied by Trump.The stock is now down 20% year-to-date and off about 30% from its January peak. Those losses far outpace the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 12% in 2025.Investors in Nvidia — formerly the market's foremost darling — are being forced to come to grips with the stock's position at the epicenter of multiple headwinds. \"Nvidia has found itself in the middle of many crosscurrents this year,\" Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI on Wednesday.Detailed below are three major forces holding Nvidia back in 2025:1. \"A victim of its own success\"This ultimately boils down to Nvidia's sheer size and weighting in major indexes, which has resulted from the stock's eye-watering climb in recent years.Now that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the clear leader of the AI-chip revolution, expectations have been ratcheted up. After all, Nvidia has grown its annual revenue by 383% since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.\"The stock has become a victim of its own success where the exponential growth following the release of ChatGPT became unsustainable given how large sales had become,\" Hickey said.2. AI incursionsThe first warning of a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth rate was the release of a large-language model from China, named DeepSeek.DeepSeek was significant in that it utilized nuanced efficiency gains that helped boost performance on par with mainstream GPTs, all while using significantly less computing power.The swift decline in Nvidia stock was almost fully recovered in mid-February, as tech CEOs spun DeepSeek's efficiency gains as a reason why AI should evolve even quicker.But that recovery was severely dented after Nvidia reported its earnings results in late February, which included guidance that failed to meet Wall Street's most lofty projections.3. Toxic tariff impactAfter earnings, tariff worries weighed on Nvidia stock, as it sources most of its chips from overseas factories, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor.And now investors have to worry about the US government levying export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market as a watered down AI GPU.All together, this weighs on Nvidia's ability to continue to post eye-popping growth rates in its upcoming earnings release.\"We acknowledge that this news could impact NVDA Jul-Q guide's ability to beat street estimates comfortably,\" analysts at Citi said in a note on Wednesday.These issues only compounded investor worries about the stock.\"The stock's problems started way before DeepSeek and tariffs, but these issues haven't helped as they only create more doubt as to the sustainability of its torrid growth rate,\" Hickey said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Shares in Nvidia Corporation and other chip technology companies are down in premarket trading this morning after Nvidia confirmed that it would take a significant financial hit to cover costs associated with a newly required export license so it can ship some of its latest chips outside of the United States. Here’s what you need to know about the new requirement and its effect on tech stocks. What’s happened? Yesterday, AI chipmaking giant Nvidia revealed that it will record a $5.5 billion charge this year related to its H20 chips, sending the stock down in premarket trading this morning. Nvidia made the revelation about a week after the Trump administration added new export license requirements to the H20. Nvidia initially revealed that information in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated April 9. In that filing, Nvidia revealed that the U.S. government now requires Nvidia to obtain an export license to export its H20 chips to China and select other countries. Due to this, Nvidia expects to incur about $5.5 billion in costs related to “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” of the H20. The H20 chip is a chip Nvidia designed especially for the Chinese marketplace in order to comply with U.S. export restrictions, notes CNBC. In 2024, Nvidia made between $12 billion and $15 billion selling the H20. But now the associated $5.5 billion charge will take a significant chunk out of those revenues. The Trump administration’s new export controls are also a sign that Nvidia could face an increasingly challenging environment when exporting its chips to countries that the U.S. believes could use them in ways that could disadvantage America. In Nvidia’s 8-K filing, the company said that the new export license requirement covers “the Company’s H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof” and that the United States government “indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” But China (including Hong Kong and Macau), isn’t the only country that the new export license requirement applies to. The license is also required for other so-called “D:5 countries.” According to a March 2024 publication by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, D:5 countries comprise over two dozen nations, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iran, Libya, Nicaragua, Russia, and Venezuela. On April 14, the United States government said the license requirement would “be in effect for the indefinite future,” according to Nvidia’s filing. Chip stocks fall The expected $5.5 billion charge related to Nvidia’s H20 chips has sent the stock tumbling nearly 6% in premarket trading this morning as of the time of this writing. Nvidia shares (Nasdaq: NVDA) are currently down around $6.45 to $105.75. However, it’s not just Nvidia shares that are down. The stock prices of chipmakers often move in unison—suggesting that most investors believe that what is good or bad for one company could be good or bad for the chip industry as a whole. The new export license requirement on Nvidia is a sign to many that U.S. chipmakers may see rougher waters ahead when it comes to exporting their products across the globe. Rougher export waters could lead to higher costs, reduced profits, or both. Other chipmakers this morning are currently seeing their stock price down, too, including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): down 3% Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC): down 2.7% Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO): down 4% Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU): down 3.8% Arm Holdings plc (Nasdaq: ARM): down 4.8% QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM): down 2.2% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD): down 7% ASML warns about weaker orders However, the Nvidia news may not be the only thing dragging down these other chip companies. Currently, shares in the Dutch company ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML) are also down 4.7% in premarket trading as of the time of this writing. ASML isn’t a chip maker itself. It manufactures the critical machines that chipmakers need to produce their chips. As noted by the Wall Street Journal, ASML has now reported that orders for its machines that help make semiconductors totaled $4.45 billion in its first quarter. That was well below the $5.5 billion that analysts were expecting, suggesting a massive slowdown in once-expected production by chipmakers. ASML warned that President Trump’s policies were creating uncertainty for the semiconductor industry. Not including today’s premarket falls, companies operating in the semiconductor space have had a rough 2025 so far—not helped by Trump’s recent tariff policies and now, tightening export rules. As of market close yesterday, since the beginning of the year, NVDA shares were down 16.4%, TSM shares were down 21.4%, AVGO shares were down 22.8%, MU shares were down 15.5%, AMD shares were down 21.1%, and ARM shares were down 17.5%. Before today’s premarket drop, ASML shares were down 1.8% for the year.",

The rule doesn't stop the export of H20 chips but requires Nvidia to get a license to export them.A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Exporting the H20 chips themselves isn't costing the company up to $5.5 billion. According to the filing, the charges instead could include H20 chips that have already been manufactured and now may be more difficult to sell due to the new requirement. Nvidia is also accounting for costs related to producing the chip and additional funds that may be needed to cover potential future losses.The Trump administration has taken steps to pave a way for tariffs on chips, including probes led by the Commerce Department into semiconductor imports. The investigations seek to determine what impacts those imports have on national security, which could give President Donald Trump a reason to implement tariffs on key tech goods.In general, Trump has said that his tariff strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic manufacturing of key goods. The president is also hoping to use the levies to push China to negotiate a better trade deal with the US, although the specifics around his demands are not clear.On Monday, Nvidia reiterated its commitment to invest $500 billion over the next four years in the US, promising AI supercomputers and data centers.The White House promoted the announcement as a win, calling it \"the Trump Effect in action.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced commitments to build more AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia said in a Tuesday SEC filing that it expects up to $5.5B in charges due to a new export rule.The rule targets Nvidia's H20 chips which were made to comply with Biden-era export controls.The Trump White House is eyeing tariffs on chips as a way to encourage onshore manufacturing.Nvidia expects up to about $5.5 billion in charges as a result of the Trump administration's licensing requirement to export the company's H20 chips to China, according to a Tuesday evening SEC filing.The company said in the filing that the government informed Nvidia that the export rule would be \"in effect for the indefinite future.\" Nvidia said the charges are expected to be reflected in the company's first-quarter earnings, which ends on April 27.\"First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves,\" the company said in the filing.The announcement caused Nvidia stock to slide more than 5% after trading hours.An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.Nvidia's H20 chips were specifically made to comply with Biden-era export controls on chips sent to China as the world's superpowers remain in an AI arms race.The current administration sees the new export rule as a means to address the risk of China developing its own supercomputer, the company said in the filing.

        "description": "RTX 5060 includes 8GB for $299; RTX 5060 Ti has 8GB or 16GB for $379 and $429. Nvidia is rounding out its GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards today with the official announcement of the mainstream RTX 5060 series. The company is announcing three new GPUs today: The 5060 Ti will launch on April 16 in both 8GB and 16GB variations, for $379 and $429, respectively. The regular RTX 5060 will follow at some point in May for the same $299 MSRP as the last-generation RTX 4060. It is also sticking with 8GB of RAM. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether the company and its partners can actually stock these cards at these prices. GPUs from the top-tier RTX 5090 to the mainstream RTX 5070 have been difficult to impossible to buy at their announced MSRPs. And it's not just Nvidia's problem or a high-end problem—AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs have also been hard to buy, as have Intel's Arc B580 and B570 cards. The new graphics cards' specs essentially match numbers that have been floating around for a couple of months now. Both models include modest increases in the number of CUDA cores compared to the last-generation 4060 and 4060 Ti models, with the same amount of RAM and the same 128-bit memory interface. But an upgrade to GDDR7 instead of GDDR6 provides a healthy bump to memory bandwidth and is probably also partially responsible for an increase in peak power consumption. The 4060 Ti in particular was memory bandwidth-constrained at higher resolutions, so hopefully some extra bandwidth will make it a better choice for a decent 1440p gaming PC.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Nvidia announced Monday that it will produce its artificial intelligence supercomputers in the United States for the first time.The tech giant said it has commissioned more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas—part of an investment the company said will produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the next four years.“The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.”Nvidia’s announcement comes as the Trump administration has said that tariff exemptions on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until officials develop a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry.White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won’t eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components.“They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC’s This Week on Sunday.Nvidia said in a post on its website that it has started Blackwell production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. chip plants in Phoenix. The Santa Clara, California-based chip company is also building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas—with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas.Nvidia’s AI supercomputers will serve as the engines for AI factories, “a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence,” the company said, adding that manufacturing in the U.S. will create “hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades.”Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12–15 months, Nvidia said. The company also plans on partnering with Taiwan-based company SPIL and Amkor for “packaging and testing operations” in Arizona.In a statement Monday, the White House called Nvidia’s move “the Trump Effect in action.”Trump “has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off—with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said.Earlier this year, Trump announced a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, was tasked with building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House.The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. —Sarah Parvini, AP Technology Writer",

Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang reportedly attended a $1 million-per-person dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week — and shortly after, per NPR, the White House shelved planned new restrictions on Nvidia's chip exports to China.Apple has also been seeking to dodge the tariffs' blows. The company has reportedly flown planeloads of iPhones to the U.S. in hopes of beating tariffs, delaying potential price increases or profit hits. Apple is also reportedly encouraging all its non-Chinese manufacturing operations to make as many devices as possible. At the same time, CEO Tim Cook's efforts to placate Trump seemed to bear some fruit when the White House announced Friday the new tariffs would not apply to smartphones and electronics. That felt like a repeat from Trump's first term, when Cook won a tariff exemption for the iPhone.But by Sunday, Apple's reprieve looked like it could be short-lived, with Trump warning that \"NOBODY is getting off the hook.\"Catch up quick: Tech companies began efforts to diversify their production beyond China during the first Trump administration, and those efforts expanded after the pandemic. Much of that production moved to countries like Vietnam and India that are also targets of Trump's now-paused reciprocal tariffs.

The game has four rules.Pick a crazy high investment number in the hundreds of billions of dollars, then hedge it by using terms like \"up to\" and \"planned.\"Roll together projects that were already in the pipeline with new spending plans to boost the final tally.

Nvidia said Monday (April 14) that its artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers will be built in the U.S. for the first time, starting in the next 12 to 15 months. The company is working with manufacturing partners to build two manufacturing plants in Texas — one in Houston with Foxconn and one in Dallas with Wistron — and expects to begin mass production within that timeframe, Nvidia said in a Monday press release. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency,” Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the release. Nvidia Blackwell chips are now being produced at the plants of another manufacturing partner, TSMC, in Phoenix, Arizona, according to the release. Those plants and the new supercomputer facilities will add up to a million square feet of manufacturing space, the release said. Nvidia also partners with Amkor and SPIL for packing and testing operations in Arizona, per the release. Within the next four years, Nvidia plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. through its partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor and SPIL, according to the release. “Manufacturing Nvidia AI chips and supercomputers for American AI factories is expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades,” the release said. Huang said in March that Nvidia will procure “several hundred billion” dollars’ worth of chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years. The chip designer will source these products from suppliers like TSMC and Foxconn, which can manufacture its latest systems in the U.S. By doing so, Nvidia will avoid tariffs and improve the resiliency of its supply chain, Huang said at the time. Asked during a Monday press conference about the Nvidia announcement, President Donald Trump attributed to the company’s move to tariffs. “I knew it was going to happen, but not to the extent that it happened. It’s big,” Trump said in a video of the press conference posted on X by the White House’s Rapid Response 47 account. “And the reason they did it is because of the election on Nov. 5 and because of a thing called tariffs.” The post Nvidia and Partners to Produce AI Supercomputers in US appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "It’s been another chaotic weekend when it comes to President Trump’s tariff trade war. On Friday, it was announced that electronic devices like smartphones and computers would be exempt from the looming tariffs of up to 145%—music tech investors’ ears. But by Sunday, the president had said that any exemptions would be short-lived. Despite this tariff exemption whiplash, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are all currently up in premarket trading this morning—the first trading session after the tariff exemptions were initially announced. Here’s what you need to know. Tariff exemption whiplash Since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country in the world on April 2, the stock markets have been hammered. But perhaps even worse than the tariffs’ effect on the markets has been the messaging around the tariffs. At various times over the past two weeks, administration officials have stated that the tariffs are both open to negotiation and permanent. And now the messaging over tariff exemptions is equally as confusing. On Saturday, Bloomberg was the first to report that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is charged with managing tariffs on imported goods, had posted a bulletin day earlier, on April 11, that the Trump administration had declared tariff exemptions on certain electronic devices. These exemptions meant that many popular consumer items—and items that are also critical to the supply chains of America’s Big Tech companies—would not be hit with staggering 145% tariffs if being imported from China (and lower, but still high tariffs from other nations). The bulletin said there were now exemptions on smartphones, computers, tablets, and even smartwatches, among other electronic items. This news was particularly welcome to Apple’s investors, as the company sources many of its iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches from China. But this relief surrounding the tariff exemptions was short-lived. That’s because, on Sunday, April 13, Trump officials and President Trump himself stated that the just-published exemptions weren’t actually permanent. Policy confusion continues As noted by CNN, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told ABC News on Sunday morning that “(Electronics are) exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” In other words, Lutnick seemed to confirm that smartphones and laptops are indeed exempt from the existing reciprocal tariffs. However, he further implied that, in a few months, the Trump administration will be rolling out another new type of tariff to cover items with semiconductors (computer chips) inside. That would mean smartphones and laptops will be hit with tariffs then. Lutnick also said that upcoming tariffs targeting products that are key to national security, which likely include semiconductor products, are “not available for negotiation.” President Trump also chimed in on Sunday on Truth Social, announcing that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump went on to claim that “There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday.” He said that the reportedly previously announced exempted products like smartphones and laptops were still subject to an existing 20% fentanyl tariff “and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” “The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” the president continued. “We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” Big tech stocks react in Monday trading While Apple would undoubtedly be the biggest winner from any electronics exemptions in the tariffs on China, nearly every major tech company would benefit as well. Even if they do not sell physical hardware products, they rely on servers and other electronics to keep their software services running. So it’s no wonder that, what the Trump administration says is now just a temporary pause, is still being met with a positive reaction in the markets when it comes to the stock prices of the Magnificent Seven. Here’s how Mag Seven stocks are reacting at the time of this writing in premarket trading: Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG): up 1.4% Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN): up 1.6% Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL): up 4.9% Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META): up 1.7% Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT): up 0.8% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): up 1.8% Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA): up 1.3% It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that while the Trump administration says any tariff exemptions are temporary, you have to take that with a grain of salt—or at least be aware that things could change in the future. The administration’s stance on tariffs—or at least the administration’s messaging around its stance on tariffs—has been all over the place this month. Things could be very different a week from now, as Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed out this weekend. “Nobody can figure out what the rules will be five days from now, much less five years from now,” she said (via CNN). This story is developing . . .",

        "description": "Nvidia's healthcare strategy leverages AI to revolutionize medical imaging and diagnostics, according to healthcare GM Kimberly Powell. Kimberly Powell Nvidia healthcare general managerHLTHNvidia aims to integrate AI into every industry.Medical imaging firms could be early adopters of AI in healthcare, said Nvidia GM Kimberly Powell.Powell named two healthtech companies that could surge from AI.Nvidia's vision of the future puts AI in every corner, crack, and crevice of the healthcare industry. But getting there may not be easy, perhaps, especially in the US.The graphics processing unit, Nvidia's breakthrough chip that enables most of AI today, is a powerful tool. but it can't fix antiquated systems, regulations made in the paper era, and privacy concerns from both doctors and patients.Still, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is famously drawn to what he calls \"zero-billion-dollar markets,\" where he can build technology from scratch and educate the industry it fits into. In healthcare, that job falls to Nvidia General Manager for healthcare, Kimberly Powell.Business Insider spoke to Powell about the realities of integrating AI into the sometimes intransigent healthcare industry. Powell has worked at Nvidia for 17 years, and healthcare, she has said, is one of the company's largest oppounities.This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.What's one area of the healthcare industry you spend a lot of time in?One of our entry points into healthcare was medical imaging. When you go see your doctor, you're usually going in with some kind of symptom. And the first thing that happens is you go get imaged — they're going to look for something.Radiology is a very step-by-step process: Set up the machine, capture the right image, and make sure the quality is good. Can I do some analysis before it gets to the radiologist? Should I circle this thing?So you can add AI at a bunch of those stages to improve the whole workflow.As I learn more about Nvidia's full-stack I notice some partners that have been in the niche supercomputer space and have grown immensely alongside Nvidia. Are there any companies in healthcare that you feel are way under the radar but will become incredibly important because of AI?I think GE is one of them, which is why we partner with them. Diagnostic imaging is a $50 billion industry that only serves one-third of the population. If it were more autonomous, it could serve the entire population, perhaps, and be three times as large.Some of these companies are 100 years old. They're used to selling hardware. Their big transformation over the last decade of working with them has been how to not just read the sensor data so that another human can read it, but enhance the sensor data to see more things. De-noise it, or enhance, it or add AI on top of it.Another company most people don't know is IQVIA.IQVIA is a clinical research company. For decades, it has conducted clinical trial research for the pharmaceutical industry.That means they're working inside healthcare systems, as you're doing trials, you're collecting all this information about patients and their electronic health records, their labs, their imaging, what they ate for breakfast — that kind of stuff.They've essentially created a data network because they serve 10s of 1000s of customers. So they have a data network that now all of a sudden can get an agentic AI — an intelligence layer — put on top of it to start offering services.What they've done in the past is taken their data and they've sold it to Company A, Company B, and Company C, so that A, B, and C would take it in-house and try to build their own intelligence layer on top, recreating the wheel at every single one and doing it for different purposes.They now have an opportunity to take a very pristine dataset and overlay an intelligence layer on it. IQVIA is like the SAP and ServiceNow of the healthcare industry.A lot of the examples of AI in healthcare sound like they could change the costs. Imaging would have to be billed very differently if it was so ubiquitous in the way you're describing. Do you think about how the costs are going to shift? It feels like a pretty radical change.It is a radical change, and it will take radical change across a very complicated economic system.There's lots of conclusive evidence that if you catch, for example, some levels of cancer at stage one versus stage four, they're preventable and the cost to the system is drastically changed.But we're still in a very 'treat the sick' rather than 'keep them healthy' mode. If we could have systems that can catch things earlier, then that should create a calculation that would make a lot of sense.I'm wondering if you spend any time talking to ordinary people about AI and healthcare.Yeah, I'm curious to know how people would interpret having a phone listen to their doctor because, on the one hand, they think about all these privacy concerns, but on the other hand, when I explain the benefits, they realize — 'Oh my God, that would change the experience forever for good.' It's just, sometimes it seems invasive.But they don't know the 55 positive byproducts of AI being in the system. I pretty much live and breathe healthcare. So I'm talking about it all the time.I was talking to my 9-year-old daughter, for example, and she was like, 'Why do you want a robot to do that?' And it's like, well, \"Just like you get tired at night and your handwriting gets worse, you know, surgeons also get tired, and so if a robot could be there to help them.\" These are the conversations that I have. We're all patients, right?Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Nvidia was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem.Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesCurtis Priem is one of Nvidia's three co-founders, alongside Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky.Priem left Nvidia in the early 2000s and has been actively involved in philanthropy ever since.In the years since Nvidia's founding, the company has become one of the most valuable in the world.Curtis Priem has always been forward-looking man. Even in the nascent days of computer graphics and video games, he saw the great potential that lay ahead for visual technology.Priem poured his time and energy into graphics technology, creating the first graphics processor for a PC, the IBM Professional Graphics Adapter, according to his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).But there is one event upon which Priem looks back with regret: had he held onto all of the stock he once owned in the AI, software, and computer hardware juggernaut Nvidia, he would be one of the richest people alive with a net worth north of $70 billion, according to a Forbes estimate.Instead, Priem is now worth an estimated $30 million, according to Forbes, which is more than enough to keep him living in comfort. Priem lives in an off-the-grid house near Fremont, California, not far from the headquarters of the company he co-founded in 1993.Early careerPriem attended RPI in Troy, New York, graduating in 1982 with a degree in computer electrical engineering.His first job after graduating from RPI was with the now-defunct tech firm Vermont Microsystems. But it was a move to California to work at Sun Microsystems that would kick his career into drive.At Sun, Priem played a pivotal role in the development of the aforementioned graphics card, making his mark on the tech world and establishing himself as a leading figure in the design and development world.Nvidia's foundingAs the story goes — corroborated in a Stanford Business School interview by Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO — Huang, Priem, and Nvidia's other co-founder, Chris Malachowsky, met at a Silicon Valley Denny's restaurant to discuss their potential partnership.Malachowsky worked at Sun Microsystems along with Priem, while Huang had worked at both LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices. And, famously, before graduating from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering (he'd add a masters from Stanford in the same field later), Huang worked as a dishwasher at Denny's.Nvidia was founded on April 15, 1993. The founders shared a \"a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets\" and worked tirelessly to do so, with Nvidia inventing the world's first GPU, or graphics processing unit, in 1999.That same year, Nvidia went public, with its IPO happening on January 22, 1999. Shares were valued at $12 each.Post-NvidiaAs of 2025, Nvidia's shares had hit a peak of just below $150. This represents a massive surge in value for the company, which had share prices under $6 in late 2019.Nvidia's surge can be directly linked to the recent rise of AI. The company's long dedication to complicated graphics processing made it well-suited to pivot to the complex world of artificial intelligence computing.That surge has led to Jensen Huang net worth estimates above $115 billion, a staggering sum by any comparison, and it's roughly 3,833 times more than the net worth of his erstwhile partner, Priem.A private man by most accounts, it's unknown exactly why Priem left Nvidia. He moved into his off-the-grid house in a relatively remote corner of California and today rarely ventures out except to make several annual visits to his alma mater, RPI, with which he has remained actively involved.Priem is a note philanthropist and, including the glut of money he gave away after Nvidia's IPO, he has continued to donate money through his own Priem Family Foundation.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem.Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesCurtis Priem is one of Nvidia's three co-founders, alongside Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky.Priem left Nvidia in the early 2000s and has been actively involved in philanthropy ever since.In the years since Nvidia's founding, the company has become one of the most valuable in the world.Curtis Priem has always been forward-looking man.

        "description": "Nvidia is one of the firms \"more protected\" from Trump's tariffs, Morgan Stanley said this week. Jensen Huang delivering the keynote address at Nvidia's annual GTC ConferenceJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNvidia might be able to easily weather Trump's trade war, Morgan Stanley said.The bank said it believed the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's business could be \"minimal.\"Demand for Nvidia's chips is strong, and the company could work its supply chain around duties, it said.Trump's escalation of his trade war has dragged down the market's highest-flying stocks— but there's good reason to think that Nvidia could ultimately be relatively unscathed in a trade war.That's according to Morgan Stanley, which called Nvidia its \"Top Pick\" in the market on Thursday, even as Trump doubled down on his tariff threats on China and caused the historic sell-off in stocks to accelerate.Semiconductors were left out of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. But tariffs on chips could potentially be on the table in the future, Morgan Stanley said — one thing that's clouding the outlook for mega-cap tech stocks, which have sold off heavily in the last week.Semiconductors were left out of Trump's April 2 tariff plan.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesBut, even if tariffs are implemented on chips, Nvidia looks like it could face \"fairly minimal\" consequences from those duties, in part because demand for its chips is so strong and because the firm has some flexibility with its supply chains, analysts at the bank said.\"NVIDIA remains our Top Pick with the undeniably positive GPU data points and an inference market clearly starved for GPUs across multiple hyperscalers. We think sustained AI spend and NVDA's relative supply chain flexibility will help them outperform, even in a higher tariff environment.\"Nvidia's chip hypeCEO Jensen Huang said that demand for Nvidia's Blackwell chip was \"insane.\"Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley said demand for Nvidia's chips is booming, largely due to the \"tight\" capacity for large language learning models to make new predictions and inferences. That's driving strong demand for Nvidia's products, even older-generation chip models like Hopper, it added.Nvidia reported record revenue of $39.2 billion over the last quarter, up 78% year-over-year.CEO Jensen Huang has also said that demand for Blackwell, Nvidia's latest chip, has been \"insane.\"\"Our industry contacts are generally unconcerned by the tariffs, because demand is strong, Blackwell is sold out, and demand is quite price insensitive,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts added.Supply chain alternativesMost builds for Nvidia's GB200 platform may be in North America and not subject to tariffs, Morgan Stanley said.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesMost of the framework for some of Nvidia's products may already be in North America. That means important components may not face tariffs at all, given the US's recent trade deal with Canada and Mexico.Morgan Stanley said it believed most of the builds for Nvidia's supercomputing platform, GB200, were likely already in North America. In a previous note, analysts pointed to how Hon Hai, one of Nvidia's partners, said it would boost its capacity for GB200 severs this year, which the bank said could be completed in a facility in Mexico.Bianca boards, one component of the GB200 platform, could also potentially be built in Mexico, given the recent \"significant ramp\" of capacity for the boards in the nation, analysts added.Other Nvidia partners, like ZT systems, could also potentially build GB200s in facilities in the US, the bank said.That's lowering tariff risk for Nvidia, though analysts noted that the stock could still be vulnerable in the event of a recession.\"That said, NVIDIA seems among the more protected companies, and will have minimal direct impact,\" the bank said of tariffs. \"But the type of recession also matters, as demand for GPUs remains resilient - and we would say risks to that come more from the financing side than from anywhere else,\" they later added.Nvidia shares have been hit harder than the overall market since Trump plowed ahead with his latest tariff plan in early April. Shares dropped as much as 14% in the first two trading days following Liberation Day, compared to the S&P 500, which dropped as much as 10% over that timeframe.Read the original article on Business Insider",

It will also utilize the technology's ability to learn rapidly from vast amounts of data.The current version of ProPILOT is designed for highway use and provides cruise control and assistance with steering and braking.That makes it more limited than rival systems offered by Tesla and automakers in China, where advanced autonomous driving tech is rapidly becoming standard.The partnership is a major milestone for Wayve, which also struck a deal last year with Uber to collaborate on self-driving tech.As companies like Waymo or Tesla hype up full driverless technology — also known as Level 4 driving — Wayve is more interested in working in what it views as an untapped market for advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, for automakers. This includes Level 2 and Level 3 driving, which allows for a car to drive itself in certain conditions but still requires the presence of a driver.\"Our competitors are those who are also making really performant ADAS, L2, L3 solutions,\" Kaity Fischer, Wayve's VP of commercial and operations, told Business Insider at the recent Ride AI conference in Los Angeles, noting that Wayve's clients are largely original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\"L4 is still our North Star, and down the road, that will be the technology that we deploy.\"Fischer said one advantage of Wayve's driver technology is that it's \"hardware agnostic,\" meaning the software can work with OEM cars that may be outfitted with different levels of hardware support for self-driving, such as lidar or cameras.One of the ongoing debates in the automotive world is whether a cameras-only approach to full self-driving — most notably led by Tesla — is a safe, cheaper, and, as a result, superior route to achieve fully autonomous driving at scale.\"To change the hardware on a vehicle platform is anywhere from a four to six-year lead time and it's very expensive,\" Fischer said. \"We're able to work with OEMs and say, 'Alright, what hardware do you have already submitted for your upcoming production models? And then we can work together on the level of autonomy that makes sense for their vehicle.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Wayve's self-driving cars are being tested on the road in the UK, US, and Germany.WayveNissan is teaming up with self-driving startup Wayve on a new version of its assisted driving tech.The Japanese firm is the first carmaker to use tech from the Microsoft and Nvidia-backed AI startup.Wayve's cars run on cameras and AI, allowing them to \"generalize\" in the same way a human would.One of Europe's buzziest AI startups is teaming up with Nissan as the Japanese automaker looks to overhaul its assisted driving tech.Nissan said on Wednesday it would incorporate autonomous driving software from London-based startup Wayve into its ProPILOT driver-assist system in 2027.The partnership makes Nissan the first automaker to use Wayve's self-driving tech.The London-based startup is among the hottest names in the world of self-driving cars, raising over $1 billion last year from investors including SoftBank, Nvidia, and Microsoft.Like Tesla, Wayve's fleet of self-driving Ford Mach-Es uses cameras and end-to-end AI models that learn how to drive from real-world testing and simulations.CEO Alex Kendall previously told Business Insider this allows Wayve's vehicles to \"generalize\" and adjust to new driving scenarios in the same way a human would, rather than relying on radar systems like lidar and high-precision mapping like rivals such as Waymo.Wayve has expanded rapidly over the past year and is now testing its vehicles in the US and Germany in addition to its home base in the UK.Nissan said the next generation of ProPILOT will incorporate Wayve's AI Driver alongside next-generation lidar to provide advanced collision avoidance capabilities.

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen HuangArtur Widak/NurPhotoNvidia CEO Jensen Huang's leadership sometimes involves intense, public examinations of his team's work.Author Stephen Witt's book about Huang and Nvidia debuts in the US on Tuesday.Witt experienced Huang's ire when he brought up the more sci-fi-adjacent potential for AI.At Nvidia, getting a dressing-down from CEO Jensen Huang is a rite of passage.The CEO has confirmed this in interviews before. But author Stephen Witt can now speak from experience. Witt is the author of \"The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip.\" The book chronicles the CEO's life and career, and Nvidia's historic rise from a background player to star of the AI revolution.Witt describes a fair bit of yelling throughout Nvidia's history.The company's culture is demanding. Huang prefers to pick apart the team's work in large meetings so that the whole group can learn. Witt's book delves into not just what Nvidians have done but how they think, or rather don't think about what their inventions will bring in the grander scheme of world history.Stephen Witt's \"The Thinking Machine,\" in a bookstore in Taipei, Taiwan, was released first in Asia, followed by the US this month.Robert SmithIn the final scene of the book, which is already available in Asia and released in the US on April 8, Witt interviewed Huang in a room covered in whiteboards detailing Nvidia's past and future. Huang was visibly tired, having just finished the company's non-stop annual conference in 2024. After a series of short, curt responses, Witt played a clip of science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke from 1964 musing that machines will one day think faster than humans, and Huang changed entirely.Witt wrote that he felt like he had hit a \"tripwire.\" Huang didn't want to talk about AI destroying jobs, do the interview anymore, or cooperate with the book.Witt told Business Insider about that day, and why Huang sees himself differently than other tech titans like Tesla's Elon Musk and OpenAI's Sam Altman. Nvidia declined to comment.This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.At the end of the book, Huang mentions Elon Musk and the difference between them. You asked him to grapple with the future that he's building. And he said, 'I feel like you're interviewing Elon right now, and not me.' What does that mean?I think what Jensen is saying is, that Elon is a science fiction guy. Almost everything he does kind of starts with some science fiction vision or concept of the future, and then he works backward to the technology that he'll need to put in the air.In the most concrete example, Elon wants to stand on the surface of Mars. That's kind of a science fiction vision. Working backward, What does he have to do today to make that happen?Jensen is exactly the opposite. His only ambition, honestly, is that Nvidia stays in business. And so he's going to take whatever is in front of him right now and build forward into the farthest that he can see from first principles and logic. But he does not have science fiction visions, and he hates science fiction. That is actually why he yelled at me. He's never read a single Arthur C. Clarke book — he said so.He's meeting Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and other entrepreneurs in the middle. They're coming from this beautiful AGI future. Jensen's like, 'I'm going to just build the hardware these guys need, and see where it's going'. Look at Sam Altman's blog posts about the next five stages of AI. It's really compelling stuff. Jensen does not produce documents like that, and he refuses to.So, for instance, last month, Musk had a live-streamed Tesla all-hands where he talked about the theory of abundance that could be achieved through AI.Exactly. Jensen's not going to do that. He just doesn't speculate about the future in that way. Now, he does like to reason forward about what the future is going to look like, but he doesn't embrace science fiction visions. Jensen's a complicated guy, and I'm not still completely sure why he yelled at me.This is hard to believe, but I guarantee you it is true. He hates public speaking, he hates being interviewed, and he hates presenting onstage. He's not just saying that. He actually — which is weird, because he's super good at it — hates it, and he gets nervous when he has to do it. And so now that GTC has become this kind of atmosphere, it really stresses him out.Stephen Witt is the author of two books including \"The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip\"Stephen WittEarlier in the book Huang flippantly told you that he hopes he dies before the book comes out. The comment made me think about who might succeed 62-year-old Huang. Did you run into any concrete conversations about a succession plan?He can't do it forever, but he's in great shape. He's a bundle of energy. He's just bouncing around. For the next 10 years, at least, It's going to be all Jensen.I asked them, and they said they have no succession plan. Jensen said: 'I don't have a successor.'Jensen's org chart is him, and then 60 people directly below him. I say this in the book, he doesn't have a second in command. I know the board has asked this question. They didn't give me any names.You describe in the book how you were a gamer and used Nvidia graphic cards until you very consciously stopped playing out of worry you were addicted. Did Nvidia just fall off your radar for 10 to 15, years after that? How did you end up writing this book?This is an interesting story. I should have put this in the book. I bought Nvidia stock in the early 2000s and then sold it out of frustration when it went up.I basically mirrored [Nvidia cofounder] Curtis Priem's experience and sold it in 2005 or 2006 — which looked like a great trade for seven years because it went all the way back down. I was like, 'Oh, thank God I sold that,' because it went down another 90% after that.I probably broke even or lost a small amount of money. I have worked in finance and one of the counterintuitive things that people don't understand about finance is the best thing you can do for your portfolio is sell your worst-performing stock because you get tax advantages.So I was aware of kind of the sunk cost fallacy, and it looked like a great trade. Then I paid no attention to the company for 17 years. It wasn't until ChatGPT came along that I even paid attention to them coming back. And I was like, wait — what's going on with Nvidia? Why is this gaming company up so much? I started researching, and I realized these guys had a monopoly on the back end of AI.I was like, \"Oh, I'll just take Jensen and pitch him to the New Yorker\". I honestly thought the story would be relatively boring. I was shocked at what an interesting person Jensen is. I thought for sure when I first saw the stock go up, they must have some new CEO doing something interesting.To my great surprise, I learned that Jensen was still in charge of the company and in fact, at that point, was the single longest-serving tech CEO in the S&P 500.I was like, it's the same guy? Doing the same thing? And then Jensen was so much more compelling of a character than I ever could hope for.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen HuangArtur Widak/NurPhotoNvidia CEO Jensen Huang's leadership sometimes involves intense, public examinations of his team's work.Author Stephen Witt's book about Huang and Nvidia debuts in the US on Tuesday.Witt experienced Huang's ire when he brought up the more sci-fi-adjacent potential for AI.At Nvidia, getting a dressing-down from CEO Jensen Huang is a rite of passage.The CEO has confirmed this in interviews before. But author Stephen Witt can now speak from experience. Witt is the author of \"The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip.\" The book chronicles the CEO's life and career, and Nvidia's historic rise from a background player to star of the AI revolution.Witt describes a fair bit of yelling throughout Nvidia's history.The company's culture is demanding. Huang prefers to pick apart the team's work in large meetings so that the whole group can learn. Witt's book delves into not just what Nvidians have done but how they think, or rather don't think about what their inventions will bring in the grander scheme of world history.Stephen Witt's \"The Thinking Machine,\" in a bookstore in Taipei, Taiwan, was released first in Asia, followed by the US this month.Robert SmithIn the final scene of the book, which is already available in Asia and released in the US on April 8, Witt interviewed Huang in a room covered in whiteboards detailing Nvidia's past and future.

It's overthinking — it's stuck in a loop,\" Davis continued.Davis, along with researchers from Nvidia, Google, IBM, MIT, Stanford, DataBricks, and more, launched an open-source framework Tuesday. It's called Ember and it could portend the next phase of large language models.Overthinking and diminishing returnsThe concept of \"overthinking\" might seem to contradict another big break in model improvement: inference-time scaling. Just a few months ago, models that took a little more time to come up with a more considered response were touted by AI luminaries like Jensen Huang as the future of model improvement.Reasoning models and inference-time scaling are still a huge step, Davis said, but future developers will likely think about using them, and all models, differently.Davis and the Ember team are formalizing a structure around a concept that he and other AI researchers have been playing with for months.Nine months ago — an eon in the machine learning world — Davis described his hack of asking, referred to as \"calling\", ChatGPT 4 the same question many times and taking the best of the responses.Now, Ember's researchers are taking that method and supercharging it, envisioning compound systems wherein each question or task would call a patchwork of models, all for different amounts of thinking time, based on what's optimal for each model and each question.\"Our system is a framework for building these networks of networks where you want to, for example, compose many, many calls into some broader system that has its own properties. So this is like a new discipline that I think jumped from research to practice very quickly,\" Davis said.In the future, the model will choose youWhen humans overthink, therapists might tell us to break problems down into smaller pieces and address them one at a time. Ember shares some of that theory, but the similarity ends pretty quickly.Right now, when you log into Perplexity or ChatGPT, you choose your model with a dropdown menu or toggle switch. Davis thinks that won't be the case for much longer as AI companies seek better results with these more complex strategies of routing questions through different models with different numbers and lengths of calls.\"You can imagine, instead of being a million calls, it might be a trillion calls or quadrillion calls. You have to sort the calls,\" Davis said. \"You have to choose models for each call. Should each call be GPT 4? Or should some calls be GPT 3?

Technology like his has been most relevant to the telecom industry for decades and is now finding new markets in AI data centers.Retym's finished product is exempt from tariffs when it enters the US, but the semiconductor supply chain is complex. Products often cross borders while being manufactured in multiple steps, packaged, tested, and validated, and then shipped to the final destination.A global tariff-rich environment will probably bring up his costs in one way or another, Gandhi told BI. End customers like hyperscalers and the ecosystem of middlemen who bundle all these elements together and sell them will figure out how to cover these costs without too much consternation to a point, he said.\"Demand is not particularly price sensitive,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore Thursday.AI is already an area where companies appear willing to spend with abandon. But, it's also maturing. Now, when companies are working to put together realistic estimates for normal business metrics like return on investment, unit economics, and profitability, tariffs risk pushing that down the road, potentially years.Have a tip or an insight to share?

        "description": "Data center will be >50% of semis; CSPs/OpenAI, Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom are best positioned The post 2030 Data Center AI Chip Winners: The Trillion Dollar Club appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. At the start of 2025, I believed AI was overhyped, ASICs were a niche, and a market pullback was inevitable. My long-term view has changed dramatically. AI technology and adoption is accelerating at an astonishing pace. One of the GenAI/LLM leaders, or Nvidia, will be the first $10 Trillion market cap company by 2030. Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly improving in both capability and cost efficiency. There are now more than 500 million users per week, led by ChatGPT, and that number is growing fast. This exponential growth is fueling massive increases in data center usage and capital expenditures, primarily driven by the leading CSPs — Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and now OpenAI. Four of these are trillion-dollar market cap companies. They will pick the semiconductor winners. At GTC 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang projected $1 trillion in global data center CapEx by 2028. At this pace, data center CapEx could reach ~$1.4 trillion by 2030. I’m looking for the big picture in this analysis – the numbers 5 years out are ballpark estimates to understand the trends. In the most recent quarter, data center-related shipments by Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Intel, Marvell, SK hynix, Micron and Samsung exceeded a $220 Billion annual run rate – excluding power chips. (Thanks to Objective Analysis for memory shipments into the data centers.) Wall Street expects Nvidia revenues to double from 2024 to 2027 to about $275 billion per year. About 90% of this is for the data center; and much of this is networking, software, and systems, not just GPUs. Nvidia doesn’t sell semis. They sell modules, boards, racks, and systems. If Nvidia grows by another 50% by 2030, its annual revenue will surpass $400 billion, primarily driven by data center demand. This is partly because GPUs have become like smart phones. They improve so fast in performance per watt that it’s economic to replace them after just 3 to 5 years. Power is the limiter for data centers, so performance/watt is more important than performance/$. With LLMs scaling rapidly, semiconductor spend in data centers is expected to exceed $500 billion by 2030, representing more than 50% of the entire semiconductor industry. Rough 2030 semiconductor spend: GPU/AI Accelerator 60% Networking 15% CPU (x86 & ARM) 10% Non-HBM DRAM/Flash 10% Power, BMC, etc. 5% The AI tsunami will bypass most semiconductor companies. Nearly all data center semiconductor revenues are concentrated among nine companies: Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom, Samsung, AMD, Intel, Micron, SK hynix, and Marvell. A few smaller companies with $10B or less market caps have significant data center exposure — Astera, Credo, MACOM, ASPEED, Alchip, GUC, and SiTime. The trillion-dollar giants (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Nvidia and Broadcom) can acquire smaller firms like AMD, Intel, Marvell, Mediatek, Astera, and others to secure their AI leadership. Category breakdowns and key players: 1) GPU/AI Accelerator Winner: Nvidia Contenders: Broadcom, and potentially AMD Recent AI accelerator quarterly revenues: Nvidia ~$33B Broadcom ~$4B Marvell ~$1B AMD <$1B Annualized, this market is more than $150B, and it’s expected to double or more to $300B to $400B in 2030. The top four CSPs now account for about half of Nvidia’s sales. As only the largest players can build high-value fronter LLMs, this sales concentration will likely continue. Nvidia’s top customers already spend $20B annually, and they’re growing fast. While developing custom accelerators may cost ~$500M/year, this is cost-effective if the result is cheaper accelerators optimized for internal workloads. Nvidia’s margins are ~75%, Broadcom’s about ~65%. If they both built identical AI accelerators for $25 cost, Nvidia’s would sell for $100, and Broadcom’s for $75. So building with Broadcom saves 25%. Further, GPUs are very programmable. But as Sam Altman said, it is possible to sacrifice some flexibility, say, to focus just on transformers and still run the workloads needed. Alchip and Broadcom estimate about 40% lower cost for AI accelerators. Despite this, the big CSPs will keep buying GPUs for flexibility and risk management. Most of their cloud customers’AI models are optimized for Nvidia GPUs using PyTorch. Nvidia announced a very aggressive GPU roadmap for the next several years, aiming to outpace competition from custom AI Accelerators and AMD. AMD, meanwhile, has a huge opportunity if it can become the alternative GPU supplier to Nvidia. This is AMD’s ticket to the trillion-dollar club. CEO Lisa Su has shown the ability to come from behind and win. The LLM developers want AMD to succeed and will give them business where they can be competitive. But AMD has challenges: It is catching up on GPU performance, but can it keep pace? Nvidia NVLink72 has scale-up switching capabilities, while AMD doesn’t. In addition, Nvidia is scaling up to 576 GPUs in the next few years. Nvidia CUDA has a dozen years of development, and now Dynamo adds to the company’s software lead. Assuming CSPs and OpenAI purchase two-thirds of all AI accelerators in 2030, splitting their needs between custom ASICs and GPUs, GPU spend could reach $200B to $270B, mostly from Nvidia. Custom AI accelerators could account for $100B to $130B (Broadcom CEO Hok Tan has projected $60B to $90B TAM by 2027). And there could be upside to these numbers. Key requirements for competing in AI Accelerators include: A very large ASIC team; High speed analog expertise (PHYs moving to 448GT/s); Advanced 2.5D/3D advanced packaging, and Strong financials and access to TSMC leading-edge nodes and packaging. Broadcom has ~80% of the custom ASIC market now and will likely continue to be >50% because of its team, skills, capital, and because it can package its ASICs with the best switch chips outside of Nvidia. Much smaller Marvell is #2 now. AI ASIC contenders are Mediatek, Alchip and GUC. It is the CSPs/OpenAI that are driving the LLMs and the ASIC architectures. They could decide to acquire an ASIC player to further improve their cost structure. 2) AI Scale-up Networking Winner: Nvidia Contenders: Broadcom, Astera Broadcom CEO Hok Tan estimates networking is currently 5% to 10% of data center spend today, growing to 15% to 20% as the number of interconnected GPUs increases, causing interconnects to grow faster. Nvidia’s scale-up networking (e.g., NVLink72, moving to NVLink576) offers non-blocking, all-to-all connections within and across racks — a deep competitive moat. Broadcom, a strong switch chip supplier, offers alternatives for non-Nvidia systems. Marvell (via the Innovium acquisition) and Astera Labs (now public, ~$10B market cap) are emerging players. Startups like Auradine and others also are developing AI-optimized switches. Photonics and lasers will become increasingly important as copper interconnects reach their limits. Key players in this space include Coherent and Lumentum. There are many more players for scale-out networking. 3) CPU (x86 & ARM) Winner: Nvidia (using ARM) Contender: AMD Recent quarterly shipments: AMD: $3.9B (x86) Intel: $3.3B (x86) Nvidia’s ARM-based CPUs (e.g., Grace) are shipped alongside their GPUs. Though figures aren’t broken out, Nvidia is likely to surpass x86 shipments by 2030 because GPU volumes will dominate. AMD remains the strongest x86 supplier but needs to scale GPU offerings to stay competitive. 4) Memory Winner: HBM HBM revenue (~$25B) comes entirely from data centers. It offers better performance and integration than DDR, especially for AI workloads. HBM is sold as chiplets and is crucial for accelerator efficiency. HBM margins are much, much higher than DDR and flash memory. Micron and SK hynix lead in HBM development; Samsung trails behind. 5) Other Chips Winner: ASPEED Power delivery is increasingly important as GPUs surpass 1KW. AI racks require 48V systems and complex PMICs. Margins are moderate, but the market is large. ASPEED (Taiwan, ~$4B market cap) dominates the BMC market, with chips on 80% to 90% of AI boards. It has deep connections with OEMs like Foxconn and a strong competitive moat. 6) AI Foundry Winner: TSMC TSMC manufactures virtually all high-value non-memory chips for data centers, thanks to its advanced nodes and 2.5D/3D packaging expertise. More than half of its revenue already comes from AI/HPC. Samsung and Intel have the necessary technologies, but they face challenges: All chiplets must be on the same foundry processes. This is a big bet for the customer. Porting high-speed PHYs to a second foundry adds complexity. Intel’s underutilized fabs and lack of volume drivers create customer hesitancy. But AI demand may outstrip even TSMC’s capacity, requiring the use of Samsung and/or Intel. Summary LLMs are fueling explosive growth in AI data center infrastructure, set to become more than half of the global semiconductor market by 2030. This surge will benefit a narrow set of companies — those with the scale, talent, and capital to serve hyperscale CSPs. Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom, and ASPEED are best positioned due to their strong value propositions and sustainable advantages. AMD and Intel are “on the bubble” – they could join the Trillion Dollar club if they can be a viable competitor with Nvidia; or in Intel’s case with TSMC for AI Foundry. Semiconductor firms that fail to scale quickly, or which merge to create scale, may be acquired by the trillion-dollar giants. Or, they could be left behind as AI chips are increasingly developed in-house. The post 2030 Data Center AI Chip Winners: The Trillion Dollar Club appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering.",

SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E round to support its development of large quantitative models (LQMs) that help enterprises leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to solve scientific and quantitative challenges. Since spinning out from Alphabet in 2022, the company has raised over $950 million, SandboxAQ said in a Friday (April 4) press release. The company’s newest investors include Nvidia, Google, BNP Paribas, Horizon Kinetics and Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, according to the release. Its quantitative AI platforms are currently used in biopharma, chemistry, materials science, cybersecurity and financial services, per the release. “AI and advanced computing are having a powerful impact on financial services, and BNP Paribas Global markets is proud to be at the forefront of this trend,” Olivier Osty, head of corporate and institutional banking global markets at BNP Paribas, said in the release. “I look forward to working with SandboxAQ to explore innovative solutions at the cross-roads of AI and quantum technologies.” The merger of AI with quantum computing could have significant implications for financial services and other verticals, Chris Hume, senior director of business operations for SandboxAQ, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in February 2024. “The physical world is defined by quantum mechanics,” Hume said. “The more effectively we can understand those interactions and then model those interactions, the more efficiently and effectively you can build predictive models. With the algorithms that we’re developing combined with the classical computer hardware that’s available today, you can build better predictive models, and that’s the exciting part. And that’s the opportunity at hand.” SandboxAQ originated at Alphabet in 2016 and was spun off in 2022 to independently offer firms AI and quantum computing software. It formed an independent company to develop quantum AI solutions for financial services, healthcare, computer security, the U.S. government and other computer-intensive sectors. When SandBoxAQ raised more than $300 million in December, it was reported that the company works to stand out by adopting methods that differ from the approaches used by companies such as OpenAI. By running quantum physics algorithms on graphics processing units, it aims to move to more advanced machines.

        "description": "Nvidia says the Switch 2's GPU is 10 times faster than the original Switch. In the wake of the Switch 2 reveal, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia has gone into any detail at all about the exact chip inside the upcoming handheld—technically, we are still not sure what Arm CPU architecture or what GPU architecture it uses, how much RAM we can expect it to have, how fast that memory will be, or exactly how many graphics cores we're looking at. But interviews with Nintendo executives and a blog post from Nvidia did at least confirm several of the new chip's capabilities. The \"custom Nvidia processor\" has a GPU \"with dedicated [Ray-Tracing] Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements,\" writes Nvidia Software Engineering VP Muni Anda. This means that, as rumored, the Switch 2 will support Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling technology, which helps to upscale a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image with less of a performance impact than native rendering and less loss of quality than traditional upscaling methods. For the Switch games that can render at 4K or at 120 FPS 1080p, DLSS will likely be responsible for making it possible.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "2025 has kicked off with a flurry of GPU activity. 2025 has kicked off with a flurry of GPU activity. Intel's Arc B580 revealed that it's still possible to make a mid-range GPU with more than 8 GB of VRAM. AMD's RDNA 4 marked the continuation of a longstanding AMD practice where they reach for the top-end, before deciding it wasn't worth it after all. Nvidia too has a new generation to celebrate 2025, and their 5000 series launch has come and gone without cards on shelves. But bigger numbers are better, so it's time to talk about the GeForce 6 series.Gamers demand higher quality graphics with each generation. No one knows this better than Nvidia, so GeForce 6000 series cards are built to deliver near-cinematic quality at framerates high enough to support interactive gameplay. GeForce 6000 GPUs, or the GeForce 6 series for short, are built with the highly parallel nature of graphics rendering in mind. At the same time, they take a great leap forward in terms of programmability, opening up exciting new possibilities for complex in-game effects.OverviewGraphics rendering involves transforming vertex coordinates from 3D space to 2D screen space before calculating the final pixel colors, a process known as rasterization. Both stages are inherently parallel tasks, and map well to hardware with large arrays of execution units. Accordingly, a GeForce 6 series GPU is a massively parallel machine. It has a strong complement of fixed-function graphics hardware, but the real power of the GPU lies in a collection of vertex and pixel shader cores. These programmable components execute shader programs provided by the game instead of carrying out preset functions. They also serve as basic building blocks, letting Nvidia scale to different power, price, and performance targets. The highest end GeForce 6000 series chip, NV40, implements 6 vertex shader and 16 pixel shader cores.From Nvidia’s IEEE paperA highly parallel machine needs a high bandwidth memory subsystem to keep it fed. GeForce 6 series products can feature up to a 256-bit GDDR3 DRAM setup, giving it significantly more memory bus width than typical desktop CPUs. The GPU features a L2 texture cache shared across all pixel and vertex shader cores, which enables short-term reuse of fetched texture data. Nvidia did not disclose cache sizes at this time, but they aim for a 90% hitrate with many misses in flight, rather than the 99% hitrate one often sees with CPU caches. The GPU communicates with the host system via the popular AGP interface, but can also support the upcoming PCI Express standard.Vertex Shader CoreVertex shader programs transform coordinates from 3D to 2D screen space. It may sound like a trivial task that involves little more than a camera matrix multiplication and perspective division. But programmable vertex shaders open up new tricks. For example, a vertex shader can sample a texture and use it as a displacement map. Besides supporting texture accesses, GeForce 6000's vertex shader cores support branches, loops, and function calls. Much of this capability was previously unthinkable on anything outside a real CPU, demonstrating the exciting nature of GPU evolution.Vertex shader execution starts with instruction fetch from a 512-entry instruction RAM. Nvidia uses 128-bit vertex instructions from the driver format, which are translated into a 123-bit internal format. Thus the instruction RAM has approximately 8 KB of capacity. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 standard mandates a minimum of 512 instruction slots, and Nvidia's vertex shader core ISA is closely aligned to DirectX 9's HLSL instructions. Thanks to instruction limits, shader programs are immune to performance losses from instruction cache misses, which CPU programs can often suffer. Furthermore, accessing the instruction RAM doesn't involve tag comparisons like a cache would, saving power.GeForce 6000 Vertex Shader instruction layout, inferred from Mesa codeDirectX 9 vertex shader HLSL instructions broadly fall into scalar and vector categories. Scalar instructions include special operations like inverse square roots. Vector instructions generally involve basic operations like multiply-add, and operate on 128-bit vectors of four 32-bit values. GeForce 6000's vertex shader pipeline is highly optimized for this arrangement, and features separate vector and scalar pipelines. Each ISA instruction specifies both a scalar and vector operation, letting the vertex shader core exploit parallelism in two dimensions within one instruction stream. Vectors specified by the DirectX 9 shader program provide vector-level parallelism. Any scalar+vector dual issue opportunities found by Nvidia's compiler provide additional parallelism.A third source of parallelism comes from multithreading, and serves to hide latency. The vector operation slot can accept texture sampling instructions. Memory accesses from a vertex shader should still be relatively uncommon, so vertex shader cores don't have a L1 texture cache tied to their texture fetch unit. Nvidia expects a shader program will need 20-30 instructions to hide texture fetch latency, which can be hard to achieve from a single thread. Therefore, vertex shader cores can each track up to three threads and switch between them to hide latency.Instruction inputs can come from registers or constant RAM. Both consist of 128-bit vector entries to match vector execution width. Register files are split into input, output, and temporary registers. The input and output registers each have 16 entries, and are read-only or write-only respectively from the shader program's point of view. The temporary register file supports both reads and writes, and has 32 entries. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 specification lets a shader program address up to 32 registers, but Nvidia might share the register file between multiple threads. If so, a vertex shader program should use no more than 10 temporary registers to achieve maximum occupancy.Pixel Shader CorePixel shaders, or fragment shaders, do much of the heavy lifting because rendering a scene typically involves processing far more pixels than vertices. Accordingly, a GeForce 6000 GPU can have up to 16 pixel shader cores. The pixel shader cores themselves are highly programmable just like the vertex shader cores, with branching support among other goodies. However, pixel shader cores are built very differently to exploit increased parallelism typically present at the pixel level.GeForce 6000's pixel shaders use 128-bit instructions, though the encoding is substantially different from the one used in vertex shaders thanks to hardware differences. Nvidia has chosen to support up to 65536 pixel shader instructions, exceeding the DirectX 9 minimum specification of 512 instruction slots by a wide margin. Using all instruction slots would consume 1 MB of storage, so pixel shader cores might use an instruction cache.The fragment processor has two fp32 shader units per pipeline, and fragments are routed through both shader units and the branch processor before recirculating through the entire pipeline to execute the next series of instructionsFrom The Geforce 6 Series GPU Architecture, Emmet Kilgariff and Ramdima FernandoWhere Nvidia's vertex shader core operates much like a CPU with 3-way SMT to hide latency, the pixel shader core uses a SIMD execution model across threads. That parallelism, often referred to as SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread), applies on top of the SIMD you get within a thread from using multi-component vectors. Rather than tracking three separate threads, Nvidia groups many pixel shader invocations into a vector and effectively loops through the \"threads\" in hardware. This approach lets Nvidia keep thousands of \"threads\" in flight at low cost, because threads in the same vector must execute the same instruction and cannot take an independent execution path from other threads. Only the data being processed is different.Programmers must pay attention to divergence penalties with this SIMT threading model. If different threads within a vector take different directions on a conditional branch, the pixel shader core will execute both sides of the branch with non-active threads masked off. That contrasts with the vertex shader core's MIMD execution model, which allows penalty free branching even if branch directions diverge across threads running in the same core. Nvidia suggests keeping branches coherent across regions of over 1000 pixels, or approximately 256 2x2 pixel quads, hinting at very long vector lengths.Keeping that much work in flight is critical to hiding latency, but places pressure on internal chip storage. DirectX 9 lets pixel shaders address 32 temporary registers, which continue to be 128-bits wide. Keeping 256 threads in flight would require 128 KB of register file capacity per pixel shader core, which will not be achieved in GPUs for several years. GeForce 6000 uses smaller register files of unknown size. Nvidia says pixel shader programs can get the maximum number of threads in flight if they use four or fewer 128-bit registers. As ballpark estimate, 256 threads with four registers per thread would require 16 KB of register file capacity.The pixel shader core's two 128-bit vector units are placed one after another in different pipeline stages. Both can execute four FP32 operations per cycle, though only the lower one can do multiply-add. The upper one can handle special functions and texture address calculation. Texture operations are issued between the two execution unit stages. Peak FP32 throughput is 12 operations per cycle. That can be achieved for example by issuing a vector FP32 multiply in the upper stage and a FP32 multiply-add in the lower one.From a shader program's perspective, the upper and lower vector units together can complete two vector operations per cycle. Compared to the vertex shader cores, the pixel shader's sequential \"dual issue\" arrangement lets the upper unit forward its re",

        "description": "CoreWeave Inc. slipped 2.5% in its market debut after the cloud-computing provider raised $1.5 billion in a downsized initial public offering. The company’s stock opened at $39 each on Friday, below the $40 per share initial public offering. The cloud-computing provider sold 37.5 million shares at $40 apiece, down from an initial plan of 49 million shares at $47 to $55 each that might have raised as much as $2.7 billion. Nvidia Corp., an existing investor in CoreWeave, anchored the share sale with an order of about $250 million, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg, asking not to be identified because the information was private. Representatives for Nvidia declined to comment. Half of the shares sold in the IPO went to the three largest investors in the deal, other people familiar with the matter said. (Source: Bloomberg)",

        "description": "One of China’s largest server makers, H3C, has flagged potential shortages of Nvidia’s H20 chip, the most advanced AI processor legally available domestically under U.S. export controls, in a client notice seen by Reuters. The potential supply crunch could create obstacles for China’s artificial intelligence ambitions at a time when its tech firms are aggressively expanding their investments in AI. “H20’s international supply chain faces significant uncertainties,” the company said in Tuesday’s notice, adding that current inventory was nearly depleted. Geopolitical tension that is roiling global trade and supply of key materials was responsible for the uncertainty, it added, saying new shipments were expected by mid-April this year. After publication, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company declined to comment. In a statement to Reuters following publication, H3C said “after verification, neither the company nor any of its departments have issued this notice or its related content.” Demand for H20 chips has surged in recent months as companies rush to adopt Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s cost-effective AI models. Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance have significantly increased orders of the H20 since the Chinese AI startup burst into the global public consciousness since January, Reuters reported last month. The Chinese server maker said supply plans beyond April 20 also face uncertainties from raw material policy changes, shipping disruptions, and production challenges. In the notice, H3C said it would distribute incoming H20 chips on the basis of a profit-first principle, prioritising stable, long-term customers with higher profit margins on their orders. H20 processors are currently scarce in the Chinese market, said an industry source, who distributes AI servers including those that make use of H20 chips. “We were told the chips would be available, but when it came time to actually purchase them, we were informed they had already been sold at higher prices,” added the source, who sought anonymity given the information is private. U.S. officials were considering curbs on sales of H20 chips to China, Reuters reported in January. H3C is a major OEM partner for Nvidia’s AI chips in China, alongside others such as Inspur, Lenovo and Huawei’s spin-off x86 server unit, xFusion. The primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China, the H20 was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that its rival could use advanced technologies to build up its military capabilities. Analysts estimate Nvidia shipped about 1 million H20 units in 2024, generating revenue of more than $12 billion for the company. Huawei and Cambricon offer domestic alternatives to the H20. —Liam Mo, Che Pan, Fanny Potkin and Brenda Goh, Reuters",

        "description": "CoreWeave plans to reduce the size of its U.S. initial public offering and price its shares below the indicated range, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday, dampening expectations that the listing would boost investor appetite for IPOs. The Nvidia-backed cloud services provider is now looking to sell 37.5 million shares, 23.5% less than originally planned, and price them at $40 apiece, well below even the low end of the indicated range, the source added, requesting anonymity discussing confidential information. Nvidia will anchor the CoreWeave IPO at the price with a $250 million order, the source said. The sale would raise about $1.5 billion and value CoreWeave at about $23 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to Reuters’ calculations. The company did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. It is expected to price the IPO later on Thursday. CoreWeave’s roadshow, which began last week, received a weaker-than-expected reception as risk-averse investors in a volatile market weighed concerns over the company’s long-term growth, financial risks and capital intensity, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Among the concerns is CoreWeave’s heavy reliance on Microsoft, whose shifting AI datacenter strategy could impact long-term demand for chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs. While investors appear comfortable with the company’s high leverage since it has strong free cash flow, the risk of commitments not being fulfilled remains a worry. Additionally, CoreWeave’s capital-intensive business model raises questions about sustainability, adding to broader market uncertainty. CoreWeave has been a significant customer for Nvidia, deploying over 250,000 of Nvidia’s GPUs by the end of 2024. Investors’ lukewarm reception to the CoreWeave IPO could signal reduced confidence in the AI infrastructure market, as the scaling of GPU assets in AI training slows down. “The business model doesn’t appear fundamentally flawed, but this suggests investors are recalibrating AI infrastructure valuations,” said Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPOX. CoreWeave and some existing investors had initially aimed to sell 49 million shares in the offering priced between $47 and $55 each to raise as much as $2.7 billion. That would have valued the company at up to $32 billion on a fully diluted basis. Mounting concerns CoreWeave’s stock market debut has been closely watched as a test of the strength of a recovery in the U.S. IPO market and whether investor enthusiasm for AI newcomers remains strong or has started to wane. The number of U.S.-listed equity capital markets deals, including both IPOs and block trades of shares, fell to 187 in the first three months of this year, down from 243 during the same period last year, according to Dealogic data through Wednesday. The total value of these transactions also dipped, falling from $74.02 billion to $63.48 billion. Despite the AI boom, there are growing concerns that data center spending will be uneven, with investments concentrated among a few giants while others struggle to keep pace. DeepSeek, China’s low-cost AI rival, has also emerged as a growing threat, fueling concerns about pressure on data center spending. CoreWeave had debt of about $8 billion as of last year. It also leases its 32 data centers and some equipment, instead of owning them, resulting in operating lease liabilities of $2.6 billion. In its offering filing, the company had said about $1 billion of the IPO proceeds would be used to pay down debt. The company has said it would continue to borrow. CoreWeave has yet to turn a profit, and IPO investors in the last few years have been wary of backing companies with no history of profitability. Ahead of its IPO, CoreWeave secured partnerships with major AI players, including Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Earlier this month, it signed an $11.9 billion infrastructure deal with the ChatGPT maker. The cloud services provider, which offers access to data centers and high-powered Nvidia chips for AI workloads, will also issue $350 million in shares to OpenAI through a private placement as part of the offering. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the IPO. The downsizing was first reported by Semafor on Thursday. —Echo Wang, Krystal Hu, Milana Vinn, Manya Saini, Niket Nishant, and Ateev Bhandari, Reuters",

For example, a marketer might produce an Instagram ad using a 3D replica of a product, which is easy to digitally insert into an image with all the correct dimensions.These replicas can also now contain all their manufacturing information and real-life physics, such as weight.

        "description": "Nvidia stock slumped this week on news that the company is at risk of losing business in China as a result of new regulation. Jensen Huang announced details about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, Rubin.Patrick T. Fallon / AFPThere's a key date Nvidia investors should watch: May 15.That's when new AI chip rules are rolling out, which could be a catalyst for NVDA, BofA said. Strategists reiterated their \"buy\" rating and $200 price target for the stock.Nvidia investors have a key catalyst on the horizon, according to Bank of America.Strategists at the bank are watching May 15, the day the US government will roll out the so-called AI Diffusion Rule, a regulatory framework that aims to control foreign countries' access to high-tech chips from the US. The rules would impose restrictions on some sales of Nvidia's chips and potentially narrow its market, but the event could actually end up being positive for Nvidia stock. That's because the company could recover from its recent slump once wider geopolitical concerns are \"sized and priced,\" the bank said on Thursday. Jensen Huang delivering the keynote address at Nvidia's annual GTC ConferenceJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\"There is a wide range of outcomes, and NVDA stock could stay volatile till the May-15 date, aka 'Liberation Day' as a catalyst when the impact could be reflected in the stock,\" strategists said.There are several other catalysts that could boost Nvidia stock, the bank said. Strategists pointed to a potential recovery in GM, which announced a partnership with Nvidia earlier this month, as well as Nvidia's new Blackwell Ultra chip.In its most recent earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip was \"extraordinary.\"\"Meanwhile, we believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends,\" the bank said.Bank of America reiterated its \"Buy\" rating on the chipmaker and issued a price target of $200 a share, implying 75% upside from current levels. The stock was trading around $113 on Thursday morning and is down 18% year-to-date.After back-to-back years of stellar growth, Nvidia stock has lost momentum this year thanks to budding concerns about US AI dominance, as well as jitters related to tariffs and the outlook for the economy.Earlier this month, investors had their eyes set on Nvidia's GPU Tech Conference, dubbed the \"Super Bowl of AI,\" where Huang gave key updates on the firm's new projects and what it sees for the path ahead.Shares have sagged this week on news that Nvidia is at risk of losing business in China, thanks to new energy-efficiency rules that would bar sales of some chips. The stock fell as much as 5% Wednesday morning and edged lower another 1% on Thursday.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Fast food giant Yum Brands has worked for years to distance itself from third-party tech partners. Last week, it made the ultimate power move: a development deal with Nvidia, a tech giant consistently ranked among the most valuable companies in the world. “We want to own the intellectual property. We want to own the technology,” Yum Brands chief digital and technology officer Joe Park told the Wall Street Journal. “That’s a shift in our strategy as we think about AI.” In other words: Yum knows its strength and wants full control over its own data. The company will build more services for its 61,000 restaurants with Nvidia’s tech with the goal of quickly processing and understanding critical information about store-level performance and giving managers personalized action plans. Yum Brands owns fast food powerhouses Taco Bell and KFC along with delivery stalwart Pizza Hut and its more recent acquisition, a less-known burger concept called Habit Burger. It says it’s Nvidia’s first restaurant partner, an important distinction in what could become a restaurant-tech land grab. The restaurant industry has been historically slow to deploy new tech, but seems to be excited about AI. According to data from the National Restaurant Association, about a third of restaurant operators plan to invest in AI for operations this year—a significant increase from the year before. Of course, Park is quick to tell the WSJ, all of this new tech won’t replace human workers. Instead, he says, they’ll be trained on “a different form of service and hospitality than I think we’ve seen in the past.” (This is a common refrain from industry execs who promise employees will augment new tech, freed up to provide additional human connection inside restaurants. In tandem, the execs celebrate the efficiency and reduced labor costs that tech brings to their operations.) Yum hasn’t been shy about its desire to use tech to win. In 2023, it shared an aggressive sales target, albeit without a timeline: It wants all of its sales to come through digital channels. Digital ordering carries a host of benefits, including a restaurant’s ability to collect real-time data. Additionally, consumers tend to spend more when they place orders digitally thanks to smart upsells and better order accuracy. It’s made some progress toward that goal. In 2024, the company’s system-wide digital sales were up 15%, representing over half of sales. In the fourth quarter alone, it processed $9 billion in digital sales. Given the huge growth potential (and massive amount of money involved), Yum is right to hold its own ordering data close. It’s a lesson the company may have learned the hard way. In 2018, Yum signed an exclusive deal with Grubhub, the onetime national leader in online ordering and delivery. Grubhub would power delivery at both Taco Bell and KFC, and Yum invested $200 million in Grubhub, a 3% stake. The deal flamed out rather spectacularly just two years later. Yum, realizing the delivery tailwind thanks to the onset of the pandemic, started working with competing delivery services like Uber Eats, which Grubhub said violated the terms of their agreement. In hindsight, this was Yum’s first big digital flex: We’re too big and powerful to be constrained by your platform, it seemed to say. When Grubhub moved to increase the fees it charged Yum’s restaurants, Yum sued Grubhub for breach of contract, eventually offloading its investment for a reported $208 million. The Nvidia deal, on paper at least, should accelerate Yum’s next transition. To start, it will use the tech to add voice AI to its drive-thrus and phone lines, targeting a relatively modest 500 restaurants in the second quarter of this year. Eventually, Park says, they’ll use the tech to optimize all ordering channels, including the company’s mobile apps, and hone in on in-store productivity and accuracy with Nvidia-powered computer vision. —Kristen Hawley",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang broke into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people in 2024.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesJensen Huang has come a long way from waiting tables at Denny's.The Nvidia CEO has an estimated net worth of $106 billion.Here's a look at how he built his fortune — and how he spends his money.Nvidia's blockbuster year has been good news for its CEO, Jensen Huang.Nvidia earnings were strong in 2024, and the company's stock price has been up in the first quarter of the year.Huang, who cofounded the company in 1993 and has served as its president and CEO ever since, has seen his net worth balloon as the chipmaker's market cap rises.In 2024, he broke into Forbes' list of the top 10 richest people for the first time ever. His net worth today is approximately $106 billion, according to the ranking.Now leading one of the Magnificent 7 companies, Huang has come a long way from his first job washing dishes and cleaning toilets at Denny's.Here's a closer look at how Huang built and spends his fortune:How Huang became a billionaireAs of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is the company's largest individual shareholder.Before starting Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic and at semiconductor company AMD, which is today helmed by his distant cousin, Lisa Su.Huang cofounded Nvidia in 1993 and has been president, CEO, and a board member ever since.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesHow much of Nvidia Huang owns, what his CEO salary isHuang received a total compensation package of $34.2 million for fiscal year 2024, which included a base salary of $996,514, as well as $26.7 million in stock awards, $4 million in cash bonuses, and $2.5 million for other expenses, including residential security and car and driver services.His pay package was up 60% from the fiscal year prior, when it was $21.4 million.Huang undertook a prearranged trading plan in 2024 to sell 6 million shares by the end of the first quarter of 2025; as a result, he offloaded roughly $700 million worth of Nvidia shares.How Huang compares to other tech CEOs and billionairesHuang's total compensation for 2024 was pretty middle of the pack compared to other tech CEOs of the Mag 7 companies.He's one of roughly 15 centibillionaires identified on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.At 62 years old, Huang is older than some of his Big Tech peers, such as Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Amazon's Andy Jassy, but younger than others, such as Apple's Tim Cook.How Huang spends his fortuneAs far as real estate is concerned, he has owned property in California, as Nvidia has headquarters in Santa Clara, as well as Hawaii.He isn't known for many ostentatious splurges, but Huang's leather jacket is a staple of his wardrobe. He has worn several over the years at high-profile events, including one lizard-embossed jacket that appeared to be from Tom Ford's spring 2023 collection and retailed for $8,990.Huang has also given some of his fortune to philanthropic causes. In 2007, he and his wife established the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation.They've given $50 million to Oregon State University, which subsequently named a research center for the couple, both of whom are OSU alums.The couple donated $30 million to Stanford University, from which Huang received his master's degree, for an engineering center. They've also given $22.5 million to the California College of the Arts.An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Nvidia dropped Wednesday morning after the Financial Times reported new restrictions from Beijing. Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BINvidia stock fell close to 5% on Wednesday morning.The Financial Times reported that China was raising restrictions on chips.This could damage Nvidia's business. China makes up 13% of total annual sales, the FT said.The move: Nvidia sank 4.54% Wednesday morning, dropping to $115 per share by 10:35 a.m. ET. The flagship semiconductor firm is down 14.24% this year.Why: A report from the Financial Times says the chipmaker is at risk of losing business in China, which accounts for $17.1 billion in annual revenue for the company.The threat has arisen after Beijing introduced new energy efficiency rules that would effectively remove a best-selling Nvidia processor from the Chinese market.The FT reported that the government was encouraging Chinese groups to build data centers with chips that meet tighter energy requirements not satisfied by Nvidia's technology. Its H20 chip, a processor originally designed to satisfy US export controls put in place on China, wouldn't be permissible under the new rules.What it means: While Chinese demand for the H20 chip has remained strong for several months, sources told the FT that regulators had pushed Chinese tech giants to forgo the Nvidia processor.This poses a direct threat to Nvidia's business in China, which makes up 13% of its total sales. At the same time, the top US chipmaker is dealing with rising competition in the country, as Chinese tech giants catch up to American AI peers using cheaper and older processors. This has raised concerns about the need for Nvidia's hardware, and the massive spending of US tech leaders as they pursue their AI ambitions.Nvidia is working to address China's rules. The FT reported that the company was looking to speak with senior executives and was working on H20 adjustments that would make the chip satisfy the new requirements.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Some had a glimpse of the slides ahead of time, but no one knew for certain until the words came out of Huang's mouth.DataDirect Networks, or DDN, was one of the lucky ones to leave the arena happy. Huang named the company alongside Dell, HP Enterprise, Hitachi, and IBM. But while those firms have enjoyed broader name recognition in the tech world for decades, DDN was invited on the rocket ship that is Nvidia just a few years ago — and everything changed.DDN makes hardware, but more importantly software that allows GPU users to access their stored data fast. It cuts down on latency, which is the industry term for lag in AI systems that can delay, for example, the answer to a question asked of a chatbot like ChatGPT.When Nvidia sells $100 worth of GPUs, DDN's opportunity is $5-10 dollars.\"You have to have the right amount of performance, reliability, and stability to extract your data at full speed, real-time, to feed the GPUs,\" Paul Bloch, DDN's 64-year-old President, told Business Insider.The company has been working with Nvidia for about eight years. Before that, it served the stable, but much smaller industry of supercomputers for decades.Bloch and CEO Alex Bouzari are fixtures of the supercomputing world. Before the AI boom, top research universities, government labs, and the oil and gas industry knew them well. But mainstream data centers didn't need them. They do now.\"For the very first time, your storage system will be GPU-accelerated,\" Huang said at GTC.DDN President and Cofounder Paul BlochDDNAs data sets grow larger and AI is used at scale for data-heavy applications like real-time video, Bloch can see a day when the company scales independently of Nvidia.\"All of a sudden it's much easier to deliver the value in AI because we've already done it in the past with similar market,' Bloch said. \"That's why the success of the company has gone exponential.\"DDN has found a new gear in the age of AI.

And Bloch and his team are learning to work at Jensen Huang's pace — what he calls the \"speed of light.\"\"Jensen's emails are fantastic. They are 10 words or less,\" Bloch said.Moving into the era of AI has taken some adjustments, but today, DDN and its competitors are essential to the parallel computing that enables AI. When a company seeks to set up a GPU cloud, it has to have a version of DDN's tech. And DDN is part of Nvidia's reference architecture, which is the recommended setup for maximal GPU performance.Not all of Nvidia's customers choose to use these instructions, but the mere fact has brought DDN new customers. Hyperscalers have traditionally preferred to use their own recipes of parts and players in their data centers, but Bloch said that in the era of Nvidia's Blackwell, they are starting to come around.Now it's preparing for a blockbuster third decade. In January, the company raised $300 million in growth funding from Blackstone at a $5 billion valuation, and Bloch got a congratulatory email from Huang at 6:30 a.m. the morning of the announcement, he said.\"DDN does not need the money, per se,\" Bloch said. \"We're profitable.

A real estate contractor turned data center project manager, he had pivoted to AI infrastructure in 2023, drawn by the promise of China’s AI craze. At that time, traders in his circle bragged about securing shipments of high-performing Nvidia GPUs that were subject to US export restrictions. Many were smuggled through overseas channels to Shenzhen. At the height of the demand, a single Nvidia H100 chip, a kind that is essential to training AI models, could sell for up to 200,000 yuan ($28,000) on the black market. Now, his WeChat feed and industry group chats tell a different story. Traders are more discreet in their dealings, and prices have come back down to earth. Meanwhile, two data center projects Li is familiar with are struggling to secure further funding from investors who anticipate poor returns, forcing project leads to sell off surplus GPUs. “It seems like everyone is selling, but few are buying,” he says. Just months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height, fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the ground who spoke to MIT Technology Review—including contractors, an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers—most of the companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The local Chinese outlets Jiazi Guangnian and 36Kr report that up to 80% of China’s newly built computing resources remain unused. Renting out GPUs to companies that need them for training AI models—the main business model for the new wave of data centers—was once seen as a sure bet. But with the rise of DeepSeek and a sudden change in the economics around AI, the industry is faltering. “The growing pain China’s AI industry is going through is largely a result of inexperienced players—corporations and local governments—jumping on the hype train, building facilities that aren’t optimal for today’s need,” says Jimmy Goodrich, senior advisor for technology at the RAND Corporation. The upshot is that projects are failing, energy is being wasted, and data centers have become “distressed assets” whose investors are keen to unload them at below-market rates. The situation may eventually prompt government intervention, he says: “The Chinese government is likely to step in, take over, and hand them off to more capable operators.” A chaotic building boom When ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in late 2022, the response in China was swift. The central government designated AI infrastructure as a national priority, urging local governments to accelerate the development of so-called smart computing centers—a term coined to describe AI-focused data centers. In 2023 and 2024, over 500 new data center projects were announced everywhere from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong, according to KZ Consulting, a market research firm. According to the China Communications Industry Association Data Center Committee, a state-affiliated industry association, at least 150 of the newly built data centers were finished and running by the end of 2024. State-owned enterprises, publicly traded firms, and state-affiliated funds lined up to invest in them, hoping to position themselves as AI front-runners. Local governments heavily promoted them in the hope they’d stimulate the economy and establish their region as a key AI hub. However, as these costly construction projects continue, the Chinese frenzy over large language models is losing momentum. In 2024 alone, over 144 companies registered with the Cyberspace Administration of China—the country’s central internet regulator—to develop their own LLMs. Yet according to the Economic Observer, a Chinese publication, only about 10% of those companies were still actively investing in large-scale model training by the end of the year. China’s political system is highly centralized, with local government officials typically moving up the ranks through regional appointments. As a result, many local leaders prioritize short-term economic projects that demonstrate quick results—often to gain favor with higher-ups—rather than long-term development. Large, high-profile infrastructure projects have long been a tool for local officials to boost their political careers. The post-pandemic economic downturn only intensified this dynamic. With China’s real estate sector—once the backbone of local economies—slumping for the first time in decades, officials scrambled to find alternative growth drivers. In the meantime, the country’s once high-flying internet industry was also entering a period of stagnation. In this vacuum, AI infrastructure became the new stimulus of choice. “AI felt like a shot of adrenaline,” says Li. “A lot of money that used to flow into real estate is now going into AI data centers.” By 2023, major corporations—many of them with little prior experience in AI—began partnering with local governments to capitalize on the trend. Some saw AI infrastructure as a way to justify business expansion or boost stock prices, says Fang Cunbao, a data center project manager based in Beijing. Among them were companies like Lotus, an MSG manufacturer, and Jinlun Technology, a textile firm—hardly the names one would associate with cutting-edge AI technology. This gold-rush approach meant that the push to build AI data centers was largely driven from the top down, often with little regard for actual demand or technical feasibility, say Fang, Li, and multiple on-the-ground sources, who asked to speak anonymously for fear of political repercussions. Many projects were led by executives and investors with limited expertise in AI infrastructure, they say. In the rush to keep up, many were constructed hastily and fell short of industry standards. “Putting all these large clusters of chips together is a very difficult exercise, and there are very few companies or individuals who know how to do it at scale,” says Goodrich. “This is all really state-of-the-art computer engineering. I’d be surprised if most of these smaller players know how to do it. A lot of the freshly built data centers are quickly strung together and don’t offer the stability that a company like DeepSeek would want.” To make matters worse, project leaders often relied on middlemen and brokers—some of whom exaggerated demand forecasts or manipulated procurement processes to pocket government subsidies, sources say. By the end of 2024, the excitement that once surrounded China’s data center boom was curdling into disappointment. The reason is simple: GPU rental is no longer a particularly lucrative business. The DeepSeek reckoning The business model of data centers is in theory straightforward: They make money by renting out GPU clusters to companies that need computing capacity for AI training. In reality, however, securing clients is proving difficult. Only a few top tech companies in China are now drawing heavily on computing power to train their AI models. Many smaller players have been giving up on pretraining their models or otherwise shifting their strategy since the rise of DeepSeek, which broke the internet with R1, its open-source reasoning model that matches the performance of ChatGPT o1 but was built at a fraction of its cost. “DeepSeek is a moment of reckoning for the Chinese AI industry. The burning question shifted from ‘Who can make the best large language model?’ to ‘Who can use them better?’” says Hangcheng Cao, an assistant professor of information systems at Emory University. The rise of reasoning models like DeepSeek’s R1 and OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1 and o3 has also changed what businesses want from a data center. With this technology, most of the computing needs come from conducting step-by-step logical deductions in response to users’ queries, not from the process of training and creating the model in the first place. This reasoning process often yields better results but takes significantly more time. As a result, hardware with low latency (the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another) is paramount. Data centers need to be located near major tech hubs to minimize transmission delays and ensure access to highly skilled operations and maintenance staff. This change means many data centers built in central, western, and rural China—where electricity and land are cheaper—are losing their allure to AI companies. In Zhengzhou, a city in Li’s home province of Henan, a newly built data center is even distributing free computing vouchers to local tech firms but still struggles to attract clients. Additionally, a lot of the new data centers that have sprung up in recent years were optimized for pretraining workloads—large, sustained computations run on massive data sets—rather than for inference, the process of running trained reasoning models to respond to user inputs in real time. Inference-friendly hardware differs from what’s traditionally used for large-scale AI training. GPUs like Nvidia H100 and A100 are designed for massive data processing, prioritizing speed and memory capacity. But as AI moves toward real-time reasoning, the industry seeks chips that are more efficient, responsive, and cost-effective. Even a minor miscalculation in infrastructure needs can render a data center suboptimal for the tasks clients require. In these circumstances, the GPU rental price has dropped to an all-time low. A recent report from the Chinese media outlet Zhineng Yongxian said that an Nvidia H100",

The startup had deployed more than 250,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, per its filing to go public.These are incredibly valuable assets. Tech companies and startups have been jostling for the right to buy Nvidia GPUs in recent years, so any company that has amassed a quarter of a million of these components has done very well.There's a problem, though. AI technology is advancing so rapidly that it can make existing gear obsolete, or at least less useful, more quickly. This is happening now as Nvidia rolls out its latest AI chip-and-server package, Blackwell. It's notably better than the previous version, Hopper, which came out in 2022.Veteran tech analyst Ross Sandler recently shared a chart showing that the cost of renting older Hopper-based GPUs has plummeted as the newer Blackwell GPUs become more available.A chart showing the cost of renting Nvidia H100 GPUsRoss Sandler/Barclays CapitalThe majority of CoreWeave's deployed GPUs are based on the older Hopper architecture, according to its latest IPO filing from March 20.Sometimes, in situations like this, companies have to adjust their financials to reflect the quickly changing product landscape. This is done by reducing the estimated useful life of the assets in question. Then, through depreciation, the value of assets is reduced over a short time period to reflect things like wear and tear and, ultimately, obsolescence. The faster the depreciation, the bigger the hit to earnings.Amazon's AI-powered depreciationAmazon, the world's largest cloud provider, just did this. On a recent conference call with analysts, the company \"observed an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"That caused Amazon Web Services to decrease the useful life of some of its servers and networking gear from six years to five years, beginning in January.Sandler, the Barclays analyst, thinks other tech companies may have to do the same, which could cut operating income by billions of dollars.Will CoreWeave have to do the same, just as it's trying to pull off one of the biggest tech IPOs in years?I asked a CoreWeave spokeswoman about this, but she declined to comment. This is not unusual, because companies in the midst of IPOs have to follow strict rules that limit what they can say publicly. CoreWeave's IPO risk factorCoreWeave talks about this issue in its latest IPO filing, writing that the company is always upgrading its platform, which includes replacing old equipment.\"This requires us to make certain estimates with respect to the useful life of the components of our infrastructure and to maximize the value of the components of our infrastructure, including our GPUs, to the fullest extent possible.\"The company warned those estimates could be inaccurate. CoreWeave said its calculations involve a host of assumptions that could change and infrastructure upgrades that might not go according to plan — all of which could affect the company, now and later.This caution is normal because companies have to detail everything that could hit their bottom line, from pandemics to cybersecurity attacks.As recently as January 2023, CoreWeave was taking the opposite approach to this situation, according to its IPO filing. The company increased the estimated useful life of its computing gear from five years to six years. That change reduced expenses by $20 million and boosted earnings by 10 cents a share for the 2023 year.If the company now follows AWS and reduces the useful life of its gear, that might dent earnings. Again, CoreWeave's spokeswoman declined to comment, citing IPO rules.An important caveat: Just because one giant cloud provider made an adjustment like this, it doesn't mean others will have to do the same. CoreWeave might design its AI data centers differently, somehow making Nvidia GPU systems last longer or become less obsolete less quickly, for instance. It's also worth noting that other big cloud companies, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have increased the estimated useful life of their data center equipment in recent years.Google and Microsoft's current estimates are six years, like CoreWeave's, while Meta's is 5.5 years.However, Sandler, the Barclays analyst, thinks some of these big companies will follow AWS and shorten these estimates.

Nvidia has seen its fortunes soar in recent years as its AI-accelerating GPUs have become worth their weight in gold. Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just released its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental. G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, \"How does DLSS Frame Generation work?\" but it also has control over some system-level settings. By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Jensen Huang delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC 2025Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNvidia's GTC featured its first-ever Quantum Day, highlighting the next-gen field.Jensen Huang said the event was an apology for his previous comments dismissing the tech.Some panelists weren't convinced of his contrition — and the impact on the market was already done.During Thursday's Nvidia GPU Technology Conference, CEO Jensen Huang described the company's first-ever Quantum Day as an apology for comments he made in January that sent quantum stocks tumbling. Still, not all panel attendees were convinced of his contrition or belief in quantum technology — and the damage to their stocks was already done.\"You know, this is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,\" Huang said at the opening of the \"Quantum Computing: Where We Are and Where We're Headed\" panel.In January, the Nvidia CEO suggested the industry is 20 years away from quantum computing being \"very useful.\" While the remarks echoed the sentiments of many quantum skeptics, they sent stocks in the sector tumbling over 60% when uttered by the tech titan's leader.The GTC quantum panels featured three conversations between executives from up-and-coming quantum computing companies, including Quantinuum, IonQ, and SEEQC, and quantum-focused researchers from established tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.Business Insider spoke with six executives who were panelists at the Quantum Day roundtable following the event.Some of the featured panelists were excited that Nvidia's first-ever Quantum Day raised the profile of the burgeoning technology to a global audience. \"It's good for Quantum to get this kind of exposure to have so many people interested,\" said Pasqual CEO Loïc Henriet.But others weren't convinced that Huang was sufficiently repentant for his declarations — or even that he took the growing field seriously.\"It felt, at least in our session, more like Jensen asked a question, and we gave an answer versus a discussion amongst the panelists. But I think that's just probably the way he wants it because he's the star of the show,\" Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, told Business Insider. \"And I think that the messaging wasn't really Jensen saying he was wrong, but my sense was he still is not convinced of the timeline and utility of quantum computing.\"Momentum in the quantum fieldD-Wave, a publicly traded company, recently announced it had achieved the elusive industry benchmark of \"quantum supremacy\" when simulating calculations related to magnetic materials discovery. At GTC, the company announced the publication of its latest paper, which introduced a new quantum blockchain architecture for cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, and decentralized finance.Microsoft, AWS, and Google have also announced advancements in their quantum research in recent months. While the industry has not yet achieved its full potential of helping to discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, its momentum is palpable.During the GTC panel, conversations focused less on the industry's recent advancements and future quantum computing applications and more on outlining each company's technical approach to developing the next-generation technology and discussing whether the field should be renamed something like \"quantum processing\" to improve consumer understanding.Rigetti CEO Subodh Kulkarni told Business Insider the panel was a fantastic opportunity for quantum computing companies to showcase their work to an eager audience of developers. However, he suggested it could have been better organized if companies like his, which are still largely in the research and development phase, and other businesses like D-Wave's, which have more commercial applications, had separate panels to discuss their work.Baratz agreed and said that if his company is invited back, he'd want more information about how the conversation would be organized and the goals for participating. He added that it's hard to say no when Huang comes calling.\"When Nvidia creates something like this, and all the quantum companies are there, it's hard to be absent,\" Baratz said.Quantum stocks stay slumpedAhead of the GTC panel, Huang suggested he had no idea his earlier remarks would hurt the stocks of quantum computing companies, saying, \"I didn't know they were public.\"\"How could a quantum computer company be public?\" Huang joked.Two CEOs of quantum computing companies featured on the panel told Business Insider they received calls from Huang shortly after his January remarks apologizing for the massive losses.Others acknowledged Huang's intent to publicly apologize for his market-moving remarks by organizing the day of quantum-centered talks, panels, and event sessions at GTC.\"He self-admitted this event was a little bit of a mea culpa, and I believe him,\" Kulkarni said. \"I think when he made his initial statements, he honestly didn't believe that he would cause serious damage to the reputations of so many quantum computing companies, so this was a little bit of mea culpa without a doubt.\"Quantum stocks nudged upward after D-Wave's mid-March announcement but still haven't recovered from the hit they took after Huang's January comments.A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment on the panelists' criticisms of and concerns about the GTC Quantum Day.Read the original article on Business Insider Jensen Huang delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC 2025Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNvidia's GTC featured its first-ever Quantum Day, highlighting the next-gen field.Jensen Huang said the event was an apology for his previous comments dismissing the tech.Some panelists weren't convinced of his contrition — and the impact on the market was already done.During Thursday's Nvidia GPU Technology Conference, CEO Jensen Huang described the company's first-ever Quantum Day as an apology for comments he made in January that sent quantum stocks tumbling. Still, not all panel attendees were convinced of his contrition or belief in quantum technology — and the damage to their stocks was already done.\"You know, this is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,\" Huang said at the opening of the \"Quantum Computing: Where We Are and Where We're Headed\" panel.In January, the Nvidia CEO suggested the industry is 20 years away from quantum computing being \"very useful.\" While the remarks echoed the sentiments of many quantum skeptics, they sent stocks in the sector tumbling over 60% when uttered by the tech titan's leader.The GTC quantum panels featured three conversations between executives from up-and-coming quantum computing companies, including Quantinuum, IonQ, and SEEQC, and quantum-focused researchers from established tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.Business Insider spoke with six executives who were panelists at the Quantum Day roundtable following the event.Some of the featured panelists were excited that Nvidia's first-ever Quantum Day raised the profile of the burgeoning technology to a global audience. \"It's good for Quantum to get this kind of exposure to have so many people interested,\" said Pasqual CEO Loïc Henriet.But others weren't convinced that Huang was sufficiently repentant for his declarations — or even that he took the growing field seriously.\"It felt, at least in our session, more like Jensen asked a question, and we gave an answer versus a discussion amongst the panelists. But I think that's just probably the way he wants it because he's the star of the show,\" Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, told Business Insider. \"And I think that the messaging wasn't really Jensen saying he was wrong, but my sense was he still is not convinced of the timeline and utility of quantum computing.\"Momentum in the quantum fieldD-Wave, a publicly traded company, recently announced it had achieved the elusive industry benchmark of \"quantum supremacy\" when simulating calculations related to magnetic materials discovery. At GTC, the company announced the publication of its latest paper, which introduced a new quantum blockchain architecture for cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, and decentralized finance.Microsoft, AWS, and Google have also announced advancements in their quantum research in recent months. While the industry has not yet achieved its full potential of helping to discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, its momentum is palpable.During the GTC panel, conversations focused less on the industry's recent advancements and future quantum computing applications and more on outlining each company's technical approach to developing the next-generation technology and discussing whether the field should be renamed something like \"quantum processing\" to improve consumer understanding.Rigetti CEO Subodh Kulkarni told Business Insider the panel was a fantastic opportunity for quantum computing companies to showcase their work to an eager audience of developers. However, he suggested it could have been better organized if companies like his, which are still largely in the research and development phase, and other businesses like D-Wave's, which have more commercial applications, had separate panels to discuss their work.Baratz agreed and said that if his company is invited back, he'd want more information about how the conversation would be organized and the goals for participating.

        "description": "Nvidia's GTC conference has become a central point in the calendar for the ever-expanding AI industry.Emma CosgroveNvidia's annual GTC conference wrapped up on Friday after a week of panels and exclusive events.The weeklong tech showcase highlighted advancements in AI, robotics, and quantum computing.Here are five key points to take away if you missed the GTC festivities this week.The Super Bowl of tech was held this week in San Jose, drawing audiences from around the world to marvel at advancements across the industry that were showcased during Nvidia's annual GTC conference.While Nvidia has hosted GTC — that's short for GPU Technology Conference — since 2009, the event has expanded over the last decade and a half to highlight not just advancements in semiconductors, accelerated computing, and artificial intelligence but also robotics, autonomous and electric vehicles, and future-looking technology like quantum computing.\"People have noticed that the feeling of GTC has really changed,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a Thursday press conference.And he's right, the event has changed.If you weren't able to attend GTC this year, here's what you missed.AI is big business now, and the stakes are higherIn last year's GTC keynote, Huang mentioned the word \"revenue\" once. This year it was mentioned 10 times. The message was that it's time for everyone in the AI ecosystem — not just Nvidia — to make money.In his keynote, Huang emphasized Nvidia's evolution from a chip company to an AI infrastructure company that sells \"AI factories.\"As he described, AI factories produce intelligence, and the most productive factory should be the most successful. Huang said the quality of each company's AI factory will have a big impact on its overall revenue. And that applies to any industry, whether it's traditionally in \"tech\" or not.\"Every industry is here. Every country is here, and every company is here because we have become a foundational company by which other companies are built,\" Huang told reporters Thursday.Nvidia is at the center of the AI ecosystemSince Nvidia's technology enables most of the innovation in AI today, it also sets the bar for what's possible — how fantastically engineers can apply their imaginations. The next round of chip architecture that Huang described in his keynote address drew a small gasp from the audience in the room due to the power and performance claims.Cloud companies and AI developers at the conference told BI the ecosystem is still wrapping its head around what massive advances in chip performance will mean for what developers can build and what other players in the infrastructure ecosystem need to prepare. That's why, Huang explained, the company announced several generations at a time.\"Now everybody else can plan,\" he said in a Thursday press conference. \"In the good old days, you're building chips. Somebody buys a chip, they put it in the computer, they sell a computer. What we do now is we build AI infrastructure that are deployed hundreds of billions of dollars at a time, and so you better do a good job planning.\"The cadence of AI innovation has picked upThere was an urgency in the halls of the San Jose Convention Center, likely due to packed schedules and long lines. But the pace of AI model innovation has quickened too, and in side conversations, press conferences, and panels the refrain was that each new paradigm lasts about six months.Nvidia's Senior Director of High-Performance Computing and AI Factory Solutions Dion Harris told Business Insider that one of the most important stakeholders he spends time with in his day-to-day work is cutting-edge researchers. They are closer to what's coming next and can potentially drive the most value, for example, from the AI factory model, in the future.Robots are coming, but they're not here yetThe exhibition floor featured a variety of robots and self-driving cars to underscore what Huang said in his keynote.Huang described robots as a substitute for human labor in short supply, the key that could make every car self-driving and an essential technology in taking physical action on much of the intelligence we can create today.\"Physical AI and robotics are moving so fast, everybody, pay attention to this space. This could very well likely be the largest industry of all,\" Huang said in his keynote address.A robotic future is important to Nvidia as leveraging AI to understand the physical universe and take action in three dimensions will require an immense amount of compute. And if it remains the titan provider of computing power it is today, it is expected to raise Nvidia's profile even further as it becomes the foundation of a new industry. But many of the robots on display in the convenient center are nascent in their capabilities or still in development.Nvidia announced a new open-source reasoning model for robotics aimed at accelerating out of the development phases Tuesday. The new model could make robots able to adjust to different tasks and environments on the spot.\"This is gonna make it become viable,\" Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president of Omniverse and Simulation, told BI. \"We can finally build an industry around it.\"Quantum computing is officially on the sceneOnce considered a far-away technology (even by Huang himself, who as recently as January suggested we're 20 years from the technology being \"very useful,\" sending stocks tumbling), quantum computing was vindicated at this year's GTC.Nvidia hosted its first Quantum Day, dedicated to showcasing the burgeoning technology that researchers say could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, among other outcomes.Huang started Quantum Day by declaring how wrong he'd been just months earlier before welcoming three panels of executives from various quantum computing companies to explain why quantum processing is the next frontier for the tech sector.While advancement in the field has historically been slow-going due to deeply technical problems with error correction and scalability, this year's GTC displayed the momentum that has been building behind the scenes from giants like Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Google, as well as lesser-known players like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti.Huang said onstage that this was just the first Quantum Day of many to come at GTC, demonstrating that Nvidia's conference will make space for new developments in the field.\"It seems like next year we're going to have some quantum demos at GTC,\" Huang said Thursday.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia's GTC conference has become a central point in the calendar for the ever-expanding AI industry.Emma CosgroveNvidia's annual GTC conference wrapped up on Friday after a week of panels and exclusive events.The weeklong tech showcase highlighted advancements in AI, robotics, and quantum computing.Here are five key points to take away if you missed the GTC festivities this week.The Super Bowl of tech was held this week in San Jose, drawing audiences from around the world to marvel at advancements across the industry that were showcased during Nvidia's annual GTC conference.While Nvidia has hosted GTC — that's short for GPU Technology Conference — since 2009, the event has expanded over the last decade and a half to highlight not just advancements in semiconductors, accelerated computing, and artificial intelligence but also robotics, autonomous and electric vehicles, and future-looking technology like quantum computing.\"People have noticed that the feeling of GTC has really changed,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a Thursday press conference.And he's right, the event has changed.If you weren't able to attend GTC this year, here's what you missed.AI is big business now, and the stakes are higherIn last year's GTC keynote, Huang mentioned the word \"revenue\" once. This year it was mentioned 10 times. The message was that it's time for everyone in the AI ecosystem — not just Nvidia — to make money.In his keynote, Huang emphasized Nvidia's evolution from a chip company to an AI infrastructure company that sells \"AI factories.\"As he described, AI factories produce intelligence, and the most productive factory should be the most successful. Huang said the quality of each company's AI factory will have a big impact on its overall revenue. And that applies to any industry, whether it's traditionally in \"tech\" or not.\"Every industry is here. Every country is here, and every company is here because we have become a foundational company by which other companies are built,\" Huang told reporters Thursday.Nvidia is at the center of the AI ecosystemSince Nvidia's technology enables most of the innovation in AI today, it also sets the bar for what's possible — how fantastically engineers can apply their imaginations. The next round of chip architecture that Huang described in his keynote address drew a small gasp from the audience in the room due to the power and performance claims.Cloud companies and AI developers at the conference told BI the ecosystem is still wrapping its head around what massive advances in chip performance will mean for what developers can build and what other players in the infrastructure ecosystem need to prepare. That's why, Huang explained, the company announced several generations at a time.\"Now everybody else can plan,\" he said in a Thursday press conference. \"In the good old days, you're building chips. Somebody buys a chip, they put it in the computer, they sell a computer. What we do now is we build AI infrastructure that are deployed hundreds of billions of dollars at a time, and so you better do a good job planning.\"The cadence of AI innovation has picked upThere was an urgency in the halls of the San Jose Convention Center, likely due to packed schedules and long lines. But the pace of AI model innovation has quickened too, and in side conversations, press conferences, and panels the refrain was that each new paradigm lasts about s",

This week in artificial intelligence (AI) news saw Apple facing an AI reckoning, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said computing demand is set to jump 100-fold. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs looks ahead to a year of scaling AI; Hollywood’s upset at AI and IP issues; and Citi sees AI agent-to-agent payment systems coming. Apple Demotes Executive as Siri Lags in AI Upgrades Apple took the rare move of removing its top executive in charge of Siri upgrades as the AI assistant struggled to keep up with rivals like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android and Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Apple’s obsession with perfection, a top management that lacked vision and the missing brilliance of Steve Jobs have now come home to roost. Read more: Apple’s Siri: Once a Pioneer, Now an AI Laggard Nvidia CEO: AI Will Need 100-Fold More Computing Power Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the next stage of AI will “easily” need 100-fold more computing power. At its GTC developer conference, Huang said the shift to AI agents and reasoning models means the amount of computation necessary to train and do inference on those models “has grown tremendously.” He also predicted that in the future, working alongside the world’s one billion knowledge workers will be 10 billion AI agents.

The post NVIDIA GTC 2025 Highlights Foundation Models and AI Drug Discovery appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. San Jose — “The only way to hold more people at GTC is to grow San Jose!” exclaimed Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, as he took the stage to address over 25,000 in-person (and roughly 300,000 virtual) attendees during his keynote at San Jose’s SAP Center at the annual NVIDIA GTC conference. Nvidia, the Silicon Valley-based microprocessing giant, delivered a packed program to capture the impact of AI across a range of industries, including life sciences, at what Huang described as the “Super Bowl of AI… where everyone wins.” Over 700 healthcare companies from more than 40 countries were represented at GTC to discuss today’s pressing AI applications, from the promise of protein design and foundation models to digitizing healthcare records and fully autonomous labs. Among the line-up of speakers were Nobel Laureate Francis Arnold, PhD, Vijay Pande, PhD, general partner at Andreesen Horowitz, Patrick Hsu, PhD, co-founder and a core investigator of the Arc Institute, and more. Kimberly Powell, vp of healthcare at Nvidia, highlighted that we’ve come a long way in a short period of time in applying large language models and generative AI approaches for the field of drug discovery. “We’re taking all the right models and packaging them up so people can access them. They’re getting built into software and R&D platforms of the pharmaceutical industry. So far in 2025, we’re seeing rapid adoption of these capabilities, and we know we need to keep pushing the capabilities higher,” Powell told GEN. Among the wealth of Nvidia announcements was the unveiling of DGX Spark powered by the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell platform, which delivers the utility of an AI supercomputer in a desktop-friendly size ideal for researcher and data scientist workloads. NVIDIA BioNeMo, which provides science-specific AI frameworks, pre-trained models, and generative AI tools to support drug discovery, also received a round of updates. Sapio Sciences, a software development company focusing on drug research, announced the integration of NVIDIA BioNeMo into the Sapio Lab Informatics Platform, which brings computational drug discovery directly into Sapio ELN (Electronic Lab Notebook). Within Sapio ELN, researchers can access BioNeMo NIM microservices to identify and optimize drug candidates using molecular modeling, including AlphaFold2 NIM for predicting protein structures, MoIMIM NIM to design and optimize small molecules, and DiffDock NIM, a docking model developed by MIT. Additionally, Cadence announced the expansion of its multi-year collaboration with Nvidia, focusing on driving accelerated computing and agentic AI. Notably, the integration of NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices with Orion, Cadence’s cloud-native molecular design platform, will accelerate tools for drug discovery by combining AI and cloud GPUs. NIM microservices expand Orion’s capabilities in the areas of de novo protein structure prediction, small molecule generative AI, and foundational AI models for antibody property prediction. Foundational partnerships Nvidia’s commercial announcements were also paired with partnership highlights that emphasized the rise of foundation models that generalize across biological tasks. In February, Nvidia, in collaboration with the Arc Institute, announced the release of Evo 2, the “largest publicly accessible AI model for biology to date.” The genome foundation model was trained on more than 9.3 trillion nucleotides from the genomes of more than 128,000 species across the tree of life to provide both predictive and generative capabilities, including identifying disease-associated gene variants and synthesizing new genomes computationally. Evo 2 is available for public use on the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform and as an interactive user-friendly interface called Evo Designer. In addition, the authors have made its training data, training, inference code, and model weights open source. Nvidia has described an ecosystem approach to partnering to ensure that what’s being built is co-developed with industry experts, such as researchers at Arc, to ensure utility in the field. “We partner with people who are pushing the envelope. Arc is clearly doing that at the very bleeding edge of what’s in biological understanding. The consequence of the collaboration is a platform for everyone,” Anthony Costa, PhD, director of digital biology at Nvidia, told GEN. Hsu, one of the lead researchers of Evo 2, explained what makes these technologies powerful is when there are users providing feedback on areas of research that “we don’t do at Arc.” Example Evo 2 user applications span from basic research to the patient setting, including understanding biosynthetic gene clusters for synthesizing small molecules and analyzing labeled patient data for patient stratification. “When people get more sophisticated on these models, we learn more about the science and technology to get ready to build the next thing,” weighed in Costa. Taken together, the theme of GTC remained collaboration and wide utility. “As a first-time GTC attendee, I’m blown away by the horizontality of the attendees. AI touches every part of society and it’s really remarkable to see the breadth of industries at GTC,” said Hsu.

        "description": "Tech giant Nvidia is making it clear to the world that it’s not just a company that thrives in selling chips. The company is proud to declare itself as a leading Taiwan-based AI infrastructure organization. The news was shared by the company’s CEO Jensen Huang at this year’s GTC conference in California. He mentioned that many hear the term Nvidia and think about computer accessories, GPUs, or SoCs. While it has been an industry leader in that domain in the past, it’s now venturing seriously into the world of AI. The CEO shared four innovative GPU architectures that drive AI innovation up to the year 2026 and beyond during that keynote. Such detailed road maps were unprecedented in the industry. Nvidia mentioned how it’s not operating as just an electronic company. There have been record sales of all AI GPUs for cloud providers. As highlighted by Huang, the growing dominance of this AI company can be seen through its sales of 3.6M Blackwell GPUs to four leading US-dependent cloud service providers. It’s a huge jump from the 1.3M figure we saw for the Hopper-dependent GPUs seen in the previous year.For him, AI infrastructure isn’t something you purchase and deploy tomorrow. It’s more linked to careful planning, time, and carrying out multi-year investments. So many AI factories are boosting customer revenues.Nvidia’s transformation into a new AI factory translates to new products now having an immediate effect on the client’s revenues. Today, we are an AI factory. So what this means is the factory can assist clients more more money. Moreover, factories get the chance to translate to client revenues.Now that is not easy, especially since US President Donald Trump came into power. He’s spoken about more trade wars and the rise in tariffs for Chinese imports. These currently stand at 20% and more fears continue to be expressed about the impact on Nvidia as well as buyers.Huang also chose to downplay any near threats that this might have for his company. He shared how they have a great supply network and that distribution wasn’t just restricted to Taiwan or Mexico but to different places around the globe.

Here are some of the biggest announcements and what they mean for the industry.Nvidia announces plans to build a quantum research lab in BostonDuring the roundtable discussion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced his company's plan to build a quantum research lab in Boston.\"It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world,\" Huang said. \"And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT.\"Huang was careful to note that the announcement was planned ahead of his January comments, in which he suggested we're 20 years from quantum computing being \"very useful,\" which sent quantum stocks tumbling earlier this year.Quantum blockchain architecture from D-WavePalo Alto-based D-Wave announced the publication of its latest paper, which introduced a new quantum blockchain architecture. The paper outlines how the company built and tested a \"proof of quantum\" algorithm that uses quantum computation to generate and validate blockchain hashes.Researchers in the field agree quantum computing could end encryption as we know it, resulting in massive security risks for any private data stored on the internet. D-Wave's research, the company says, could help power the next generation of blockchain for cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, healthcare, identity verification, and decentralized finance.\"We've performed connotations that your GPUs can't perform, and now we're able to build a blockchain that's more energy efficient than what's running on GPUs,\" Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, told Business Insider.Contextual Machine Learning from Infleqtion and NvidiaInfleqtion, a quantum information technology company, unveiled its new machine learning approach, called Contextual Machine Learning, during Quantum Day. The CML approach was developed in partnership with Nvidia.The CML approach leverages quantum computing to enhance artificial intelligence. It allows machine learning models to process more information over longer time periods and from multiple sources simultaneously, enhancing AI's ability to recognize patterns in sensor data, predict trends, and make real-time decisions with greater accuracy.Classical-Quantum interface from SEEQC and NvidiaThe quantum hardware manufacturer SEEQC, in partnership with Nvidia, announced the world's first fully digital quantum-classical interface demo — a milestone toward delivering the first chip-to-chip interface that will connect quantum processors with classical GPUs.\"What we've done is we've taken the core functionality of a quantum computer, put it on a chip, and then made that chip operate at the same temperature of qubits so that we can actually put them together and create the connectivity that way,\" SEEQC CEO John Levy told Business Insider.The prototype chip relies on the strengths of classical computing to handle error correction in real time while leveraging the strengths of quantum computing to process more data more quickly than classical computers alone can.\"The key insight is that we're doing it in a very power-efficient way because if you use regular chips, the heat of those chips would destabilize the cubits, so they wouldn't work,\" Levy said. \"Our chips are operating at nine orders of magnitude lower power, so that's a billion times lower power than conventional chips.\"What it means for the industryIn addition to major recent announcements involving quantum computing research from Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google, the news out of GTC highlights just how rapidly the industry is gaining momentum.Where quantum computing has for years been considered a theoretical field with little use beyond research, the evolving industry has now expanded beyond proving its academic potential to showcase its commercial uses.Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at AWS, previously told Business Insider: \"We really are at a very exciting time in quantum computing, and you're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia hosted its first quantum computing day at GTC 2025, highlighting the announcements of quantum computing companies, including D-Wave, Infleqtion, and SEEQC.Katherine Tangalakis-LippertNvidia hosted its first quantum computing day at GTC 2025.At the event, major players in the quantum space made big announcements about recent developments.The event came months after Jensen Huang said it would be decades before quantum computing will be useful.Nvidia hosted its first-ever quantum computing day on Thursday at GTC 2025, expanding the tech conference's focus beyond accelerated computing and artificial intelligence and honing in on a burgeoning technology that researchers agree could usher in new innovations in materials science, medicine, and beyond.The inaugural Quantum Day brought with it a series of announcements from quantum computing companies, including D-Wave, Infleqtion, SEEQC, and more.

D-Wave's research, the company says, could help power the next generation of blockchain for cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, healthcare, identity verification, and decentralized finance.\"We've performed connotations that your GPUs can't perform, and now we're able to build a blockchain that's more energy efficient than what's running on GPUs,\" Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, told Business Insider.Contextual Machine Learning from Infleqtion and NvidiaInfleqtion, a quantum information technology company, unveiled its new machine learning approach, called Contextual Machine Learning, during Quantum Day. The CML approach was developed in partnership with Nvidia.The CML approach leverages quantum computing to enhance artificial intelligence. It allows machine learning models to process more information over longer time periods and from multiple sources simultaneously, enhancing AI's ability to recognize patterns in sensor data, predict trends, and make real-time decisions with greater accuracy.Classical-Quantum interface from SEEQC and NvidiaThe quantum hardware manufacturer SEEQC, in partnership with Nvidia, announced the world's first fully digital quantum-classical interface demo — a milestone toward delivering the first chip-to-chip interface that will connect quantum processors with classical GPUs.\"What we've done is we've taken the core functionality of a quantum computer, put it on a chip, and then made that chip operate at the same temperature of qubits so that we can actually put them together and create the connectivity that way,\" SEEQC CEO John Levy told Business Insider.The prototype chip relies on the strengths of classical computing to handle error correction in real time while leveraging the strengths of quantum computing to process more data more quickly than classical computers alone can.\"The key insight is that we're doing it in a very power-efficient way because if you use regular chips, the heat of those chips would destabilize the cubits, so they wouldn't work,\" Levy said. \"Our chips are operating at nine orders of magnitude lower power, so that's a billion times lower power than conventional chips.\"What it means for the industryIn addition to major recent announcements involving quantum computing research from Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google, the news out of GTC highlights just how rapidly the industry is gaining momentum.Where quantum computing has for years been considered a theoretical field with little use beyond research, the evolving industry has now expanded beyond proving its academic potential to showcase its commercial uses.Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at AWS, previously told Business Insider: \"We really are at a very exciting time in quantum computing, and you're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "At NVIDIA’s developer conference on Thursday, a large group of energy companies—along with a few technology companies—announced plans to collaborate on building AI models and apps aimed at improving the generation and distribution of electric power. The initiative, called the Open Power AI Consortium, is organized by the Palo Alto-based Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Founding members include Nvidia, Microsoft, AWS, and Oracle. Notably absent from the group are all of the leading developers of frontier AI models such as Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI. “This is about getting the right data, and getting it clean, so that it can be used for AI,” Jeremy Renshaw, who leads the consortium at EPRI, tells Fast Company. Renshaw says energy companies have mountains of data, but organizing it in a way that AI models can process is key. But already, over two dozen regional power companies in the U.S. have signed on, including Con Edison, Duke Energy, New York Power Authority, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Westinghouse Electric Company. EPRI President and CEO Arshad Mansoor said in a statement that the consortium will create an AI model, datasets, and apps to “enhance grid reliability, optimize asset performance, and enable more efficient energy management.” It will also foster a collaborative environment where utilities, startups, academics, and national labs can work together to address power sector challenges using AI. The consortium doesn’t include representatives from government agencies, but Renshaw said he’d like to see their inclusion. “We intend to include anyone involved in the making and moving of electricity,” he says. “Government is important because they do the permitting, licensing, and they provide regulations.” The announcement comes amid growing concern in the tech sector over the strain that AI workloads can place on data centers. (Google even pledged last year to buy energy from small modular reactors developed by Kairos Power to support its growing AI ambitions.) Axios climate reporter Alex Freedman notes that the power demands of the so-called AI boom have become a top priority for energy company CEOs in the U.S. Freedman highlights an ongoing debate within that sector over whether the power demands of AI will prolong the use of fossil fuels. Should that prove to be the case, AI could further push back constructive work toward climate goals.",

With Nvidia’s blessing and OpenAI as a key customer, artificial intelligence (AI) startup and cloud computing provider CoreWeave is seeking to raise approximately $2.7 billion in an initial public offering (IPO). According to a Bloomberg report Thursday (March 20), shares of the Nvidia-backed startup are reportedly priced between $47 and $55 each. CoreWeave plans to offer about 47 million shares, with existing stockholders selling the remaining 1.8 million. At the top of the proposed range, the company could achieve a market value of $26 billion based on outstanding shares. The IPO’s size and valuation target are lower than initially anticipated because of a broader stock market slump due to increased volatility. Previously, CoreWeave was aiming to raise about $4 billion and target a valuation exceeding $35 billion, according to a previous Bloomberg report. The report also said the company disclosed weaknesses in internal controls related to financial reporting, citing issues such as insufficient IT controls and a lack of qualified personnel in related roles. Founded in 2017 as a crypto mining firm, CoreWeave reported revenue of $1.9 billion in 2024, with a net loss of $863 million, Bloomberg said. Other noteworthy numbers from the SEC filing: About 77% of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue came from its top two customers, with Microsoft making up nearly two-thirds of overall sales. In preparation for its Wall Street debut, CoreWeave has secured two significant partnerships. The company has agreed to provide AI infrastructure to OpenAI in a contract worth up to $11.9 billion. Additionally, CoreWeave plans to acquire AI developer platform Weights & Biases for approximately 1 million shares of Class A stock. CoreWeave’s investors include Magnetar Capital, Coatue Management, Jane Street, JPMorgan Asset Management, Fidelity and Lykos Global Management. According to Bloomberg, Cisco Systems Inc. has also agreed to invest in CoreWeave as part of a transaction valuing the company at $23 billion. According to the SEC filing, CoreWeave CEO and Co-founder Michael Intrator is expected to retain significant control post-IPO, holding about 2% of Class A shares and nearly half of Class B shares, granting him 37% of shareholder voting power. Bloomberg reported that Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are leading the IPO, with 11 other advisers also involved. CoreWeave’s shares are expected to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol CRWV. The post CoreWeave Scales Back IPO to $2.7 Billion appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week here. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang: The world got DeepSeek totally wrong At Nvidia’s GTC developer event in San Jose this week, CEO Jensen Huang called it AI’s “Super Bowl.” Indeed, Nvidia is the chip supplier of the AI boom, and arguably the most influential (and certainly most profitable) company in the growing AI industry. As it does every year, the company used Huang’s keynote to announce its next-generation chips, which will power the training and operation of the AI models of the near future. Huang introduced a new platform called “Vera Rubin,” which includes Nvidia’s first custom-designed CPU, “Vera,” and two new “Rubin” GPUs. (The platform is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered evidence of dark matter.) Nvidia says Vera is twice as fast as the Arm-based CPU in last year’s Blackwell platform. Together, Vera and Rubin deliver more than double the inference performance of Blackwell. Huang also revealed Blackwell Ultra, a more powerful version of the current flagship GPU, with increased compute and memory. It’s expected to launch in the second half of 2025. These platforms—especially Vera Rubin—are designed to boost performance during inference, the real-time reasoning AI models perform to generate answers. Huang stressed the growing need for chips that can rapidly process and store massive amounts of data during inference. In a pointed comment, he said “almost the entire world got it wrong” about the DeepSeek phenomenon, referencing the Chinese startup that claimed it could train top-tier models with fewer, weaker GPUs. “The amount of computation we need as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year,” he said. In other words, inference demand is set to soar—and with it, demand for Nvidia hardware. Huang also updated Project Digits, a desktop AI platform for developers, researchers, and students. It will ship in two versions: a compact GTX Spark, and a larger GTX Station capable of running more complex models. Nvidia says both will reach the market this summer. As Nvidia’s role in generative AI deepens, it’s pushing beyond infrastructure and into the application layer. To that end, the company announced a new family of open-source, mid-size reasoning models called Nemotron. Built on Meta’s Llama, these models can run on the Spark or Station hardware or in the cloud. While not the most advanced, they’re optimized for lighter enterprise tasks and run efficiently on Nvidia chips—offering yet another incentive for companies to stay within the Nvidia ecosystem. Big AI gives the Trump administration pointers on its ‘AI Action Plan’ As the U.S. government rethinks its approach to artificial intelligence, the emerging consensus around this second Trump administration is clear: minimal oversight, maximum freedom for industry. The working theory is that Trump and Vice President JD Vance would take a hands-off approach to AI regulation, favoring rapid innovation over safety mandates. Both Trump and Vance have emphasized the need for U.S. AI companies to operate without transparency mandates or safety guidelines, arguing that this freedom is essential for global leadership. “The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety,” Vance said during a February speech at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. On day one, the administration rescinded the Biden-era AI safety and transparency guidelines, which were largely voluntary. The Trump team is reportedly developing its own AI policy. As part of that effort, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) solicited public input on an “AI Action Plan.” The plan, according to the OSTP request, aims to define “priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance” while avoiding “unnecessarily burdensome requirements” on private-sector innovation. Comments were accepted through March 15, and several major AI companies—OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google—posted their submissions publicly. Across the board, these companies warned that overly aggressive safety rules could cause the U.S. to fall behind China in the AI race. Most supported maintaining export bans on advanced AI chips to adversarial nations like China. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google also called for protecting the Copyright Act’s “fair use” provision, which allows AI labs to train models on publicly available data. Still, some comments signaled a more nuanced view of risk. Anthropic urged the government to create mechanisms for assessing whether private-sector models could pose national security threats, and suggested opening dedicated communication channels between intelligence agencies and major AI labs. Interestingly, OpenAI seems to favor a ban on models from Chinese startup DeepSeek, citing national security concerns similar to those that led to the U.S. ban on Huawei equipment. “DeepSeek faces requirements under Chinese law to comply with demands for user data and uses it to train more capable systems for the CCP’s use,” the company said. While an AI Action Plan may be written, companies aren’t expecting strict safety regulations to follow—especially under the current administration and Congress. Yet as AI systems grow more powerful, so do the risks of unregulated misuse, potentially on a large scale. And as Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of the AI training data company Sama, points out, a lack of guardrails may actually be bad for business in the long run. “The comparison to vehicle safety standards is a good example,” she tells Fast Company. “Just as we don’t view seatbelts as ‘over-regulation’ that stifles automotive innovation, thoughtful AI guardrails protect stakeholders while enabling progress.” Superhuman is a case study in the right way to integrate AI into apps Much of the post-ChatGPT AI boom has focused on models themselves—but increasingly, the spotlight is shifting to how AI is applied and experienced in real-world apps. Some apps are entirely new, made possible only by generative AI. Others, like Superhuman, stand out for how thoughtfully they’ve integrated the technology into existing products. Superhuman has been around since 2014, and the addition of AI features hasn’t changed Superhuman’s spare and sleek design very much. Its creators have integrated AI features in a purposeful and understated way. Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra gave me a run-through of some of the newer AI features when we met at the HumanX conference last week. The AI works like a behind-the-scenes assistant, aware of the context and content of your inbox. For long or complex threads, it precomputes summaries. It can draft replies in your writing style, prompt you to respond to urgent or high-priority messages, and learn contacts’ communication patterns to time your replies for maximum visibility. It also helps organize your inbox by automatically routing less important emails—like marketing, social updates, or cold pitches—into separate folders. Vohra claims Superhuman can save users up to four hours per week. One internal study by a major consulting firm found it saved partners 3.3 hours weekly, sped up response times by 3.6 hours, and increased email throughput by 60%. At $30–$40 a month, Superhuman isn’t cheap. But for professionals overwhelmed by email, its AI-powered productivity boost may be worth the price.

Nvidia will procure “several hundred billion” dollars’ worth of chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, CEO Jensen Huang said. The chip designer will source these products from suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn, which can manufacture its latest systems in the U.S., Huang told the Financial Times (FT) in a report posted Thursday (March 20). By doing so, Nvidia will avoid tariffs and will improve the resiliency of its supply chain, according to the report. Nvidia has been highly dependent on TSMC’s manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, which are subject to the risks of threats from China, earthquakes and potential U.S. tariffs, the report said. Huang also said that the Trump administration’s policies will give a boost to Nvidia’s efforts to build data centers, which require vast amounts of energy, per the report. “Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” Huang told the FT. Huang’s remarks follow announcements from some other tech companies that are increasing their investment in the U.S. Apple said in February that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. in the next four years. The company’s plan includes hiring 20,000 workers and opening a manufacturing facility in Houston to make servers to support its artificial intelligence (AI) system, Apple Intelligence. The company also said it plans to keep expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, while opening the “Apple Manufacturing Academy” in Detroit to help companies pivot to advanced manufacturing. TSMC said March 4 that plans to expand its investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total investment in the country to $165 billion. TSMC already has an ongoing $65 billion investment in its operations in Phoenix. The company’s latest investment plans include three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and design (R&D) team center. The investment is expected to support 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years and create tens of thousands of tech jobs. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Nvidia stock has been stuck in a narrow range for the last year. On Thursday, it flashed a downbeat technical signal that could mean losses ahead for investors. Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BINvidia shares hit a \"death cross\" on Thursday signaling a potential downtrend after a 948% rally.A death cross occurs when a stock's 50-day moving average price falls below its 200-day moving average.Analyst Ari Wald suggests the signal may not lead to a major decline, citing range-bound trading.Nvidia shares flashed the dreaded \"death cross\" signal on Thursday.The technical sell signal occurs when the 200-day moving average rises above the 50-day moving average.The stock's 50-day moving average hit $127.39, dipping below the 200-day moving average of $127.73 early in Thursday's trading session before paring losses to rise about 1%. The moving average crossover strategy can signal a reversal in a prior trend, suggesting that after a massive 948% rally since October 2022, shares of Nvidia could be on the verge of a downtrend.The last time Nvidia flashed a death cross signal was in April 2022, amid a broader bear market for stocks. Shares of Nvidia went on to decline 47% before they bottomed out in October 2022.Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said the death cross signal in Nvidia shares isn't a foolproof signal of a coming decline, and could ultimately be a head fake.\"While every major decline starts with a 'death cross' not every 'death cross' leads to a major decline,\" Wald told BI.Instead, the current death cross in Nvidia shares could reflect the stock's range-bound behavior for nearly a year.\"The stock has shown a loss of momentum for a number of months which can be shown by the fact the stock has made little progress over the last 6-9 months,\" Wald said.He added that he is staying on the sidelines with Nvidia stock until the broader market shows signs that it's bottomed after its latest decline. The S&P 500 entered correction territory last week, falling 10% from its peak in February.\"For now, we'd continue to respect the continued deterioration in the stock's trend, including the most recent 'death cross,'\" Wald said.Wald sees $128 as a key resistance level and $100 as key support for Nvidia shares.

On Tuesday’s keynote, Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang detailed numerous updates, claiming AI and machine learning has “reinvented the entire computing stack,” which requires different processors, operating systems, applications and data orchestration. “The way you access data will be fundamentally different from the past,” he said, citing Perplexity’s model of fusing traditional search methods with conversational AI as the new norm. “Instead of doing retrieval that way, I just ask Perplexity what I want… This is the way enterprise IT will work in the future as well.”Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "Nvidia's GTC conference has become a central point in the calendar for the ever-expanding AI industry.Emma CosgroveNvidia's GTC conference in San Jose, California, featured CEO Jensen Huang's keynote on AI advances.Huang's speech highlighted Nvidia's new AI partnerships, software tools, and chip architectures.With crowded sessions and a bustling exhibition floor, Nvidia's immense growth was on display.The party started as so many do — with pancakes in a parking lot.I attended Nvidia's GTC conference, which has taken over downtown San Jose, California, this week. Tuesday was the biggest day for the AI juggernaut. At 10 a.m. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his keynote address, which lasted more than two and a half hours.But first, breakfast.The legendary Denny's breakfastIt was a chilly early morning in San Jose. The \"pregame\" started at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast from Denny's, the restaurant where Huang came up with the idea for Nvidia. I needed to know who would show up more than three hours early for a speech about computer chips.When I arrived just before 7 a.m., the line was already substantial. A massive red mobile Denny's kitchen was cooking up \"Nvidia bytes\" — essentially sausages and pancakes. Diners were encouraged to wrap up their bytes like a taco and add syrup on top, like Huang does.Conference-goers line up outside a Denny's pop-up restaurant outside Nvidia's GTC AI event.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderI chatted with some of the early birds. Some were die-hard Nvidia fans. Some were jet-lagged, having flown in the day before from London or Toronto, so they were up anyway. Some wanted to get into the SAP Center as soon as the stadium doors opened to avoid the massive lines that would form the hour before the speech. Some heard a rumor that Huang himself might stop by the tailgate.And sure enough, by 7:25 a.m., muscled men in suits with earpieces started multiplying. With no fanfare, Huang walked out from behind the registration tent wearing his signature uniform, all black and a leather moto jacket. The bleary-eyed crowds sprung into action — phones up for photos.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made an appearance at the company's GTC AI conference Denny's breakfast pop-up.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderHuang donned an apron and went inside the food truck to make some pancakes, as he had as a 15-year-old Denny's employee.\"At this pace, I'd run the company out of business. I used to be a lot faster,\" he said of his chef skills after emerging from the kitchen and immediately meeting CNBC reporter Kristina Partsinevelos and a camera crew.Partsinevelos tried to ground the conversation, but Huang was all jokes.\"You're talking about the stock? I'm talking about Denny's!\" he said.By 8:15 a.m., Huang disappeared into the SAP Center, where he turned up on the pre-show panel airing live inside the stadium.Nvidia Jensen Huang served breakfast to the panel on Nvidia's pregame show at his GTC keynote speech.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderAs I reached my floor seat, the panel was giving a reverent retrospective of the company — including its many brushes with failure before AI changed everything.Huang 'without a net'Leading up to the speech, Nvidia's partner companies were eager to find out if they would garner a mention on one of tech's brightest stages. One Nvidia employee told me that up to the last minute, a local war room of Nvidia employees was tweaking the company's dozens of announcements.Once the speech starts, it was all in Huang's hands.He kicked off by firing T-shirts into the crowd from an Nvidia-green T-shirt cannon.\"I just want you to know that I'm up here without a net. There are no scripts, there's no teleprompter, and I've got a lot of things to cover. So let's get started,\" Huang said.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang started his 2025 GTC keynote address by firing T-shirts into the crowd.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderThe 62-year-old CEO proceeded to blow through his scheduled two hours.He focused on Nvidia's advancements, a flurry of new partnerships and software tools for AI developers, and coming chip architectures that could underpin the computation speed and efficiency that creates new industries. These are already creating what Huang calls \"AI Factories.\"He also spoke on the challenges of realizing the AI-enabled future he has promised for years. He addressed shortages of fresh data to feed AI models, limitations in the ever-important training phase, and energy constraints.In his keynote address, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took the audience on a virtual tour of Nvidia HQ as he moved from subject to subject.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderThe world of computing has reached a \"tipping point,\" and the \"platform shift\" to accelerated computing is well underway, he said.The crowd stayed rapt, although a little antsy at the two-hour mark. But the final video clip reenergized the room. A Disney-designed robot named Blue, which looked like part of the Star Wars universe, toddled through a desert and then ascended — for real — from below the stage.Then the crowd jumped to their feet and raised their phones.\"Have a great GTC! Thank you! Hey, Blue, let's go home. Good job,\" said Jensen.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks to the Disney robot \"Blue,\" which was controlled by Disney Imagineers off-stage at his 2025 GTC keynote.Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider'We're going to have to grow San Jose'After the speech, thousands of attendees streamed into the downtown San Jose streets. The SAP Center, which had only a few empty seats, holds 17,500, and 25,000 people were expected at this year's event.The crowds made their way back to Plaza de Cesar Chavez, temporarily renamed GTC Park, to find lunch at the procession of food trucks on-site daily. Attendees again had to wait in long lines.Nvidia's GTC took over downtown San Jose this week.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderThe lunch lines were just one of many signs that GTC has outgrown its traditional home. Lines to get into the San Jose Convention Center's conference sessions snaked through the hallways.Nvidia still calls GTC a developer conference, though the evolution from technical developer confab to serious dealmaking destination was on display at a swanky building next to the convention center dedicated only to business meetings. The elevators couldn't handle the volume of people constantly coming in and out.Massive queues formed outside the building designated for business meetings at GTC as attendees waited for elevators.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderEven Nvidia team members arriving just behind me balked and abandoned ship to relocate when they saw the lines. Getting from the sidewalk to the meeting room inside the building took 35 minutes.\"The only way to hold more people at GTC is we're going to have to grow San Jose, and we're working on it,\" said Huang during the keynote.Nvidia's robotic futureLogistics aside, I soon met with Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of healthcare, who detailed the many ways Nvidia's accelerated computing is changing how doctors and hospitals work.She said it could be decades before robots can actually perform surgeries without human assistance. But companies like Moon Surgical are already creating surgical assistance robots to hold cameras and tools with arms that never tire. Nvidia also works with da Vinci robots, which can suture wounds, among other tasks.Robotics assistants for surgery are on the way, according to Nvidia.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderI then headed back to the convention center to walk the exhibition floor during happy hour, where I saw some of the technology Powell championed on display. Because Nvidia's impact spans many industries, the floor showcased cars, vacuuming robots, simulated human bodies ready for surgery, and all the biggest names in cloud computing.Robots from JotBot, Agility Robotics, Unitree, and more were on display at Nvidia GTC.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderI also passed the Nvidia gear store, which was booming. A worker there told me the 2025 GTC T-shirt and puffer vests were the biggest sellers.Nvidia's store was busy throughout the GTC conference.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderMy 12-hour Tuesday at the conference ended at the GTC Night Market back in the park. The setup was an homage to Huang's love of Taiwan's night markets, with live music, drinks, local food like bao buns, yakitori, cupcakes, and a punnily-named \"juice\" bar sponsored by GPU cloud provider Coreweave.Nvidia's Night Market is inspired by CEO Jensen Huang's childhood in Taiwan.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderIf Nvidia has its way, AI is going to continue to do a lot of hard work for us going forward. But 12 hour-days are here to stay, at least for a while. On my way back to my hotel — via San Jose bike share past a now-silent SAP Center — I thought of these two I had spotted inside the convention center:Nvidia's GTC conference is a marathon, not a sprint.Emma Cosgrove/Business InsiderHave a tip?

So it's worth explaining.I first heard about this last year when chatting with Guillermo Rauch, CEO of AI startup Vercel. He explained the role of tokens in artificial intelligence, and noted that Huang likes to say \"every company will become a token factory.\"'Everything's token'If data is the raw material of generative AI, tokens are the language. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word.An example from Nvidia: The word \"darkness\" might be tokenized into the numbers 271 for \"dark\" and 655 for \"ness.\" The opposite word, \"brightness,\" would be represented by 491 and 655. This way, the AI model can spot the same 655 number twice and understand that these words are related. Trillions of these numbers, or tokens, are used to train AI models like this, then fine-tune and run them. Instead of \"everything's computer,\" you might say that \"everything's token\" in AI.'One job and one job only'Huang, Rauch, and other technologists think modern companies will succeed by generating the most tokens. They will be AI factories churning out tokens that will be used to improve and run AI systems that help businesses make better products and services.\"I call them AI factories,\" Huang said on Tuesday at the GTC conference. \"They're AI factories because they have one job and one job only — generating these incredible tokens that we then reconstitute into music, into words, into videos, into research, into chemicals or proteins.\"He said these token-generating facilities will sometimes sit alongside companies' more traditional operations.\"Every industry, every company that has factories will have two factories in the future,\" Huang predicted. \"The factory for what they build and the factory for the mathematics, the factory for the AI.\"He cited auto manufacturing as an example, describing \"a factory for cars\" and \"a factory for AI for the cars.\"He then put some meat on those theoretical bones by announcing a partnership with General Motors in which Nvidia will help that company use AI to manufacture cars while also making GM vehicles more autonomous with AI. Does Tesla make cars or token-generating machines?Jason Liu, a machine-learning engineer and AI consultant, made a similar point with Tesla's electric vehicles and Elon Musk's goal to make them fully autonomous. When a Tesla is driven around a city, it has sensors that collect mountains of information about its surroundings. That data is collected and turned into tokens that are used to improve Tesla's AI models. That, in theory, produces better self-driving software to guide the vehicles more accurately and safely.In an AI world, most companies' roles will be to generate more data,\" Liu said.He argued that Tesla's approach of putting as many cars as possible on the road to scoop up as much data as possible has been better than Waymo's strategy, \"where engineers sat in a cave for years working on this in relative isolation, not collecting as much data, or tokens.\"Making better business decisionsLiu shared another example, this time theoretical: How can companies make better business decisions by looking back at their process and tokenizing it?\"For any major decision, there's probably six months of back and forth debate between employees on Slack chats, Zoom video meetings, board meetings, and data dashboards,\" he said.Companies can now turn all that into tokens and use that to train an AI system to make better decisions in the future or to help human executives and employees make better decisions next time.\"The job of the company and the software is to pull all that out of the humans involved and turn that into tokens for AI training,\" he added. Token factory examplesRauch says Vercel is doing this with its v0 tool, which helps developers and non-technical people build websites and applications. \"v0 takes in user requirements in English and outputs an application,\" Rauch explained. \"Those are our tokens.\"How also cited a Vercel customer called OpenEvidence, which uses AI to synthesize mountains of medical research into digestible information for busy medicine professionals. \"Their tokens are the research data that doctors need in order to make better decisions,\" Rauch said. \"It's medical intelligence tokens.\"Liu cited the example of Mercor, a startup that is hiring technical PhDs to harvest their specific knowledge and turn that into tokens that are used by AI labs to improve their models.\"The job of every company will become to produce intelligence, like a token factory,\" Rauch said. \"Companies build up institutional knowledge over time, they accrue best practices, operational principles and procedures, training manuals, brand guidelines, and even taste.

The robots were remote-controlled by a human at the event.Disney BDX Droids at Nvidia's conference on Tuesday.Emma Cosgrove/Business Insider\"This is how we're going to train robots in the future,\" Huang said, adding that two Nvidia computers were operating inside Blue.\"The BDX droids are just the beginning. We're committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, Nvidia, and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,\" Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Disney Imagineering Research & Development, said in a press release.During the keynote speech, Huang also announced an open-sourced humanoid robot foundational model, Isaac GR00T N1. A press release said Isaac GR00T N1 is \"the first of a family of fully customizable models that Nvidia will pre-train and release to worldwide robotics developers.\"Once the realm of science fiction, the hype is building around robots as AI accelerates their advancement. Nvidia is one of the leaders in the industry, which is largely powered by its AI computing chips.Huang told reporters at the GTC conference that he expects humanoids to replace factory workers in just a few years rather than decades. \"This is not a five-years-away problem,\" Huang said.Huang ended his keynote address with a nod to Disney's droid.\"Okay, Blue. Let's go home,\" Huang said. \"Good job.\"Representatives for Google did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

His confidence rests on two key reasons — though investors may need extra convincing.Kickstarting Nvidia's annual GTC conference in a San Jose arena on Tuesday — a developer bash now dubbed \"the Super Bowl of AI\" — the billionaire CEO pointed to powerful new chips and Nvidia's role in the industry's shift to inference, which is when AI performs tasks, as future demand drivers.Huang's big reveal was a new generation of Rubin chips, known as GPUs, that are expected to land next year and serve as a successor to the Blackwell and Hopper lines that have had the likes of Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg queuing up.For context, an ultra version of Rubin — set for a release in the second of 2027 — would have 14 times the performance of an ultra version of Blackwell, which is expected to be released in the second half of this year.Huang promised further advances through 2028 by teasing a line of chips named after the physicist Richard Feynman. If such trends continue, these chips are expected to blow Rubin's performance out of the water once they arrive.That's certainly one way of keeping customers with deep pockets coming back.But after Nvidia suffered a $600 billion market capitalization loss in a single day in January following panic over DeepSeek, Huang was ready to offer another reason for why demand would stay — and it was a simple one.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\"This is where almost the entire world got it wrong,\" Huang said during his GTC keynote, addressing the market's negative reactions to Nvidia after DeepSeek revealed a model that appeared to power its reasoning abilities in a phase called inference with fewer chips.\"The amount of computation we need at this point as a result agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year,\" Huang added.Huang's comment comes at a time when top AI players have increasingly shifted their focus to producing AI models that reason, such as OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1.In Huang's vision of AI's future, these models require more computing power from chips, not less.He might have to argue his case a little harder, however. Investors reacted to Huang's remarks with some concern, as Nvidia's shares dropped by over 3.4% after the keynote. A few things will have been weighing on them.For one, concerns about DeepSeek's implications for chip demand linger. Then there's the slowing growth in Nvidia's revenue: 2024's fourth-quarter revenue of $39.3 billion was up 78% from a year prior but smaller than the 262% year-on-year growth experienced in the first quarter.Huang's bet will, of course, now be put to the test. The extent of demand for Nvidia's next generation of chips and their place in a world of AI models that reason will soon be apparent.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang showed off powerful new chips to convince investors that demand will remain high.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesJensen Huang is confident that queues for Nvidia chips aren't going anywhere.The Nvidia CEO is betting on its powerful new chips and an industry shift to inference.Investors are a bit jittery, however.Jensen Huang is betting companies will continue to spend billions of dollars with Nvidia.

        "description": "If Nvidia's largest customers start to pull away next year, the stock could plunge as much as 48% in the most bearish scenario, one analyst says. Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BINvidia could hit a major growth roadblock next year, according to analyst Gil Luria.He said the chipmaker may not grow at all in 2026 if demand for GPUs wanes.In his bear case, he sees Nvidia stock dropping as much as 48% from current levels.After back-to-back years of spectacular growth, it's possible that Nvidia may not be able to grow at all in 2026, according to an analyst. Gil Luria, the head of technology research at DA Davidson has been skeptical of the stock's massive rally, and this week, he said it's possible that the chipmaker's best days could be behind it. That's because, despite the major hype for Nvidia's GPUs, there are growing risks that demand will start to level off for Nvidia's AI chips — a development that would hammer the company's stock. Luria says he has a mixed outlook on Nvidia stock overall and maintained his \"neutral\" rating and $135 price target in a recent note.But in his bear case, he sees revenue and earnings declining in 2026 as hyperscalers, which make up Nvidia's largest customers, pull back on AI spending, while Nvidia struggles to sell chips to new customers. In that scenario, the stock could plunge as low as $60 a share, Luria said, which implies a 48% decline in the stock.\"The bear case is this is peak demand. That there won't be a clean handoff from their top customers, Microsoft and Amazon, that have stabilized, to another set of customers,\" Luria said, speaking to CNBC on Monday.There are already some challenges that stand in the way of Nvidia growing its chip sales, Luria said.For one, demand for Nvidia's chips needs to hold up in China, despite the nation's slowing economy and restrictions on high tech imports from the US.Meanwhile, Nvidia's smaller customers, like CoreWeave, need to raise capital in order to support their chip purchases.Finally, the use cases of AI need to be more significant in order to justify current levels of investment in Nvidia, Luria said.\"That's too much risk to next year's estimates for us to be confident they can continue to grow at the rates analysts are expecting them to grow,\" he added.Luria's outlook comes during a big week for Nvidia, with the Jensen Huang-led firm kicking off its annual AI conference in San Jose on Tuesday. So far, the firm has given key updates on new chips in the pipeline, like its Vera Rubin chip, which has improved performance and memory compared to its older chip models.Nvidia stock, though, is still down 16% year-to-date, with shares seeing volatile moves over the last month. To Luria, it's a sign that investors are also growing skeptical of Nvidia's growth trajectory.\"So even though their products are staying ahead of the competition, it's not enough to impress investors, at least not until they can show that this translates to continued growth at these rates. Which, again, is going to be very hard to do given how fast this company has grown the last couple of years,\" Luria said.Luria's current price target, which implies 16% upside for Nvidia shares, is a compromise between his bull and bear case. While he's been a big skeptic of Nvidia's rapid growth in recent years, his bull case involves Nvidia meeting earnings expectations for next year, in which case, the stock could climb 38% higher to trade at $160 a share, he said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Brands has partnered with Nvidia to develop and scale artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for its restaurants. These technologies will be deployed at the QSR company’s KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill restaurants, the companies said in a Tuesday (March 18) press release. The partnership will help scale Yum! Brands’ existing proprietary AI-driven restaurant technology platform Byte by Yum!, according to the release. “This partnership will enable us to harness the rich consumer and operational datasets on our Byte by Yum! integrated platform to build smarter AI engines that will create easier experiences for our customers and team members,” Joe Park, chief digital and technology officer at Yum! Brands and president of Byte by Yum!, said in the release. The AI solutions will include voice-automated order-taking AI agents for drive-thru and call center operations, computer vision for optimizing drive-thru efficiency and back-of-house labor management, and AI-driven analytics and agents for assessing restaurant performance and generating personalized action plans for restaurant managers, according to the release. Yum! Brands has already piloted several AI solutions in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations and, after the success of the pilot, plans to roll out the technology to 500 Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC and Habit Burger restaurants during the second quarter, the release said. Looking ahead, the company plans to continue expanding its use of AI and integrate more advanced AI models, developing solutions that will be built with the latest Nvidia software and be proprietary to Yum!, per the release. Andrew Sun, global director of retail, CPG and QSR business development at Nvidia, said in the release that working with the Yum! Brands team and platform to integrate Nvidia AI software “breaks barriers to AI innovation in the restaurant industry — delivering real-time, context-aware intelligence, powered by a scalable inference platform.” Yum! Brands said in February that the Byte by Yum! AI-driven platform was already in use at 25,000 international locations and will be rolled out throughout its global locations. In November, the company said that it had processed over 2 million successful orders with the drive-thru voice AI system it had in place in over 300 Taco Bell stores in the U.S. and that many franchisees were eager to test this innovation at their own locations. Yum! Brands also said in November that early, limited pilots of AI-powered marketing campaigns had delivered double-digit increases in customer engagement compared to traditional digital marketing campaigns.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday (March 18) that massive computing power is needed to enable the current trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) — which is moving toward AI agents and reasoning AI models — and beyond. “AI is going through an inflection point,” Huang said in a keynote speech at GTC, Nvidia’s developer conference nicknamed “AI Woodstock” that was held in San Jose, California. This shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously,” he said. Traditional large language models use much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also immediately answer. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning within themselves before answering, which often would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still need a lot of Nvidia GPUs. The trajectory of GPU demand was in doubt in late January when startup DeepSeek disclosed that it trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 of slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for OpenAI and the like. The news wiped out Nvidia’s market value by nearly $600 billion in one day, as Wall Street sold off the stock thinking GPU demand was overblown. But Huang believes that demand will be even greater in the future because of agentic AI and reasoning. He predicted that in the future, working alongside one billion knowledge workers will be 10 billion AI agents. As proof of demand, Huang said in the peak sales year for its older Hopper GPUs, Nvidia shipped 1.3 million chips to the top four cloud computing companies (AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle). In comparison, the latest Blackwell chips already shipped 3.6 million chips in its first year. Huang also showed off a demo pitting Meta’s Llama open-source model against DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model. The user asked each model to seat family around a 7-seat table at a wedding without putting the parents of the bride and the groom next to each other, plus other constraints. Llama answered immediately and generated 439 tokens (each token is about 0.75 words). The answer was wrong. R1 got it right, but also took much longer and generated 8,559 tokens. Users pay for the number of tokens. Huang said that there are techniques to make AI processing more efficient — hence needing less computing power — but he believes that demand will stay robust in the foreseeable future. AI workload efficiency is a challenge being tackled by startups like Inception Labs. Founded by professors from Stanford, UCLA and Cornell, the startup developed a technique that does parallel processing. Instead of generating one token at a time, which takes more GPU hours, it does it in parallel, which reduces the GPU hours needed.

GM’s factories and robots will be optimized with AI using Nvidia Omniverse with Nvidia Cosmos, which are world foundation models. These will be used to create digital twins of assembly lines, enabling the virtual testing and production simulations to reduce downtime, the companies said. The two companies also plan to train robots already in use for tasks such as material handling and transport, as well as precision welding. Within GM’s vehicles, the automaker plans to use Nvidia’s Drive AGX system for advanced driver assistance and enhanced safety. GM had been using Nvidia GPUs to train its AI models, but now the partnership expands to automotive plant design and operations. Other Nvidia Collaborations Nvidia also announced a collaboration with Google and its parent, Alphabet, to speed the development of AI in robotics as well as applications in health care, manufacturing and energy. Engineers from both companies are working together to develop robots with grasping skills, reimagine drug discovery, optimize energy grids and more. Meanwhile, the chipmaker said it is working with GE HealthCare to develop autonomous X-ray technologies and ultrasound applications using Nvidia’s new Isaac for Healthcare medical device simulation platform, which includes pretrained models and physics-based simulations to help train and validate autonomous imaging systems before real-world deployment. The partnership aims to expand access to imaging technologies, currently unavailable to nearly two-thirds of the global population, by enhancing systems with robotic capabilities. Nvidia also unveiled desktop supercomputers under the Nvidia DGX brand, powered by its Grace Blackwell platform. Two models come under this brand. One is DGX Spark, which Nvidia previously unveiled as a palm-size supercomputer called Project Digits. It can deliver up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of AI compute for fine-tuning and inference. Nvidia also unveiled the DGX Station, which is a desktop supercomputer that offers data center-level performance. The chipmaker said AI developers, researchers, data scientists and students can prototype, fine-tune and inference large models on desktops either locally or in the cloud. Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo will be manufacturing the computer hardware. Nvidia is also raising the stakes in quantum computing, announcing the creation of the Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center in Boston that will integrate quantum hardware with AI supercomputers to advance quantum computing technologies. The center will start operations in 2025. The post Nvidia CEO: Why the Next Stage of AI Needs A Lot More Computing Power appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Nvidia indulged all your artificial intelligence fantasies on Tuesday at what was being called the “Super Bowl of AI.” The chip giant’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) was held at the SAP Center in San Jose on Tuesday, and it was—you guessed it—all about AI. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang made several large announcements during a two-hour keynote, with plenty of meat to keep AI-hungry consumers and businesses happy. That includes partnerships with large automakers to build autonomous vehicles and even personal AI supercomputers that sit right on your desktop. Here are some of the key announcements from Huang’s keynote: GM partnership: General Motors selects Nvidia to build out its self-driving vehicle fleet, incorporating the technology in manufacturing and enterprise centers, in addition to in-vehicle features. Nvidia Dynamo: Dynamo is, in essence, the operating system of an AI factory, which will help companies process information to streamline AI capabilities. DGX Spark and DGX Station: New desktop “personal AI supercomputers” that are powered by Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell platform. The DGX Spark was announced earlier this year under the name “Digits” and will retail for $3,000. Robotics: Huang talked at length about the coming iteration of “physical AI,” which includes robotics, and announced a joint project between DeepMind and Disney Research for a new robotics platform called “Newton.” Huang was even joined onstage by a Disney-like robot that resembled the titular character from Wall-E. Huang noted that “the time has come for robots,” as the world is experiencing a shortage of human workers. We’re “50 million short,” he said, which is what will spur the robotics revolution. With generative AI now in widespread use, and agentic AI becoming ever-more ubiquitous, it’s only a matter of time before robots and other types of “physical AI” become commonplace, too. As such, Nvidia is keen on creating the infrastructure and technology to power it all. Investors didn’t seem too enthused by the keynote, however. Prior to the keynote, shares of Nvidia Corp (Nasdaq: NVDA) were trading at around $118 per share, down roughly 1.5% during intraday trading. After it concluded around 3:15 p.m. ET, shares continued to sag. The stock was down more than 3.4% as of late-afternoon trading on Tuesday.",

        "description": "Yum! has been testing AI at some Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesTaco Bell is using AI for drive-thru orders through a partnership with Nvidia.Voice AI adoption is growing in fast food, with mixed results from McDonald's and Wendy's.Yum! Brands plans to roll out voice ordering to about 500 restaurants starting next quarter.AI is already taking orders at hundreds of Taco Bell restaurants, and there's more to come from the tech.Soon, for example, it might be able to see how many cars are waiting in the drive-thru and suggest items to shorten the wait time, Joe Park, chief digital and technology officer at Yum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, told Business Insider.Right now, \"we just know there's a car at the speaker,\" Park said. Using AI could allow the store to see that there are five cars in line, which could be useful.\"You might want to suggest selling some quicker-turnover items versus big complex things that might take longer so we can make sure our customers have great speed of service,\" Park said.Yum! Brands on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership with Nvidia, the chip firm that has cornered most of the market in AI computing.While Nvidia has become a top tech player by designing the graphics processing units that power most AI, it has also become important in building software that allows less technical companies to harness it.Nvidia and Taco Bell have already been testing voice AI for ordering at drive-thrus at some locations. The companies say they're looking at whether AI will be useful elsewhere at Yum! restaurants.Other fast-food chains have also experimented with AI, especially at their drive-thrus. McDonald's rolled out voice AI to drive-thrus at about 100 restaurants with IBM before ending the pilot last year.However, some McDonald's customers said that the AI tool got their orders wrong in videos posted on social media. The company then pulled the tech, saying that voice AI \"will be part of our restaurants' future.\"Wendy's is adding voice AI to hundreds of restaurants this year. The company says that its system's accuracy is improving, and CEO Kirk Tanner said last month that he personally tests it a few times a week.Yum! plans to roll out voice ordering to about 500 restaurants, including Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and Habit Burger and Grill, starting in the second quarter of 2025, Park said.Still, Andrew Sun, Nvidia's director of global business development for retail, said several things have to go right for AI to equal the experience of ordering from a human. The quality and speed of the AI models can make the difference between a successful and a frustrating conversation with an AI order-taker.\"We've all seen what a poor drive-thru experience could look like when it goes viral in a bad way, and we want to make sure our team members have a great experience,\" Park said.Park said Nvidia's approach of providing a speech-recognition model, a ready-made package of software and tools for specific tasks called microservices, and ongoing support should make the difference.Yet, \"you're going to have to build relationships with your customers and your team members to have trust in the system and not shut it off,\" he said.He said an off-the-shelf large language model wouldn't be good enough in a scenario where plenty of menu item names are specific to Taco Bell. For example, Park explained that the AI needs to recognize \"Limonada\" instead of \"Lemonade.\"Improving voice AI's accuracy will involve \"trial and error,\" Park continued.\"That's such a big unsaid part about AI and getting it to work,\" he added.Read the original article on Business Insider Yum! has been testing AI at some Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesTaco Bell is using AI for drive-thru orders through a partnership with Nvidia.Voice AI adoption is growing in fast food, with mixed results from McDonald's and Wendy's.Yum!

        "description": "Nvidia is No. 2 on the list of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2025. Explore the full list of companies that are reshaping industries and culture.Large language model makers continue to pour money into realizing the lofty ambitions of their systems. But one company is already reaping the rewards. Nvidia helped kick off the AI race with market-dominating graphics processing units and, according to a Q3 2024 analysis from IDC, has reached a 93% unit market share of GPUs running AI workloads worldwide. Many analysts believe it could grow further. Nvidia’s groundbreaking Blackwell processor, launched last March, is up to 2.5 times more powerful than its predecessor, the H100, and requires much less energy, says Shar Narasimhan, Nvidia’s director of product for AI and data center GPUs. The largest data center operators and AI labs, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Tesla, and xAI, are reportedly buying Blackwell GPUs by the tens of thousands. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s software and networking strive to wring the maximum speed and computing power from the chips. “We have a platform that effectively can read an AI model, understand what the model wants it to do, then go off and disseminate all of these calculations among thousands and thousands of GPUs,” Narasimhan says. “So you have all of this inner communication, then it coalesces and serves you back a single response.”While DeepSeek and Alibaba have made big strides in training cutting-edge AI on less-powerful Nvidia GPUs, Nvidia isn’t just cranking out processors. Instead, it’s actively building platforms for everything from drug discovery (Clara for Biopharma) to autonomous vehicles (Drive AGX) to video production (Holoscan) to digital twins (Omniverse). By driving AI progress in an ever-growing array of real-world scenarios and computational needs, Nvidia has positioned itself for growth.Explore the full 2025 list of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, 609 organizations that are reshaping industries and culture. We’ve selected the companies making the biggest impact across 58 categories, including advertising, applied AI, biotech, retail, sustainability, and more.",

        "description": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang rose from his first job at Denny's, where the idea for his company was born, to leading a chipmaking giant. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang is the face of the company supplying chips to many of the companies in the AI arms race.I-hwa Cheng/GettyIf you've heard about AI, you're probably familiar with Nvidia too.Booming business for the chipmaker has boosted the net worth of CEO Jensen Huang.Here's a look at the career rise of the Nvidia founder.The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.Early life, educationHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.Huang, Priem, and Malachowsky founded Nvidia in 1993.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesFounding Nvidia, leading company as CEOAt a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company.Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes.Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.Jensen Huang's familyHuang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.Nvidia plays a key role in the generative AI boom supplying highly sought-after chips used to train AI models.Patrick T. Fallon / AFPNvidia and Jensen Huang's futureHuang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The biggest tech firms will increase their combined annual spending on artificial intelligence to over $500 billion by early next decade, driven in part by a newer approach to AI from DeepSeek and OpenAI. Tech firms are expected to shift their spending from data centers and chips for AI training to inference, or the process of running AI systems after they've been trained, with inference-driven investments making up nearly half of all AI spending by 2032. The rise of DeepSeek's more efficient AI systems has prompted questions over heavy investments in developing AI, and companies like Alphabet's Google are well-positioned to pivot quickly to this new approach. Bloomberg Businessweek Technology Editor Joshua Brustein and Bloomberg News US Semiconductor & Networking Reporter Ian King report. (Source: Bloomberg)",

        "description": "With the shares down 13% in 2025, investors are looking for fresh updates from the GTC conference to help restart the rally for Nvidia. Noah Berger/Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI Investors will have their eyes on Nvidia's big GTC conference this week.The big AI event could give a badly needed boost to Nvidia stock after a 20% sell-off.Wall Street is looking for updates on the rollout of the next-gen Blackwell GPU and other endeavors. Nvidia's big artificial intelligence event this week could provide some much-needed fuel for the chipmaker's stock.The Jensen Huang-led firm kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference on Monday, its annual AI chips conference. The hotly anticipated event, which takes place in San Jose, will include a keynote speech from Huang on Tuesday, during which investors are expecting key updates on the firm's chip sales and the company's other projects.For Wall Street, the hope is that the event brings a fresh catalyst for Nvidia shares, which have been beaten down in recent months after soaring in 2024. Shares were trading around $119 on Monday, down 20% from their high of $149.42 on January 6. Louis Navellier, the chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates, told Business Insider he would be disappointed if Nvidia shares didn't jump at least 5% by the end of the week.He's expecting Nvidia to give major updates during the conference on its advancements in quantum computing, a big \"next step\" as the firm looks to speed up its AI processing.\"I expect that the Nvidia AI Developers Conference will just reaffirm NVDA's dominance on regenerative AI,\" Naveillier said to BI in an email. \"On the last day of the conference, quantum computing will be the focus and Nvidia is expected to announce business with one of the winners of its recent quantum computing development contest.\"Bank of America is also feeling positive ahead of the GTC conference. Analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia stock to $200, up from $190 a share.The bank said it expects key updates on Blackwell, as well as updates on Nvidia's robotics and quantum computing projects. Investors will be particularly focused on updates related to the outlook for GM, given the carmaker's partnership with Nvidia. Also in focus is demand for Nvidia's chips in China, competition with alternative chipmakers, and the company's expected growth for the 2026 year, analysts said.The BofA team said they reiterate their \"buy\" rating for the stock and see shares rally even as volatility related to China creates near-term headwinds. Melius Research also reiterated its \"buy\" rating ahead of the GTC conference.At the event, Nvidia is expected to show how major cloud companies and enterprise businesses are adopting its tech. The company could also potentially unveil its Blackwell Ultra, the firm said.The conference will likely bolster confidence that Nvidia can grow 10% quarter-over-quarter, Ben Reitzes, the head of technology research at Melius, said. \"Nvidia's forward PE is now 41% lower than it was on the day ChatGPT was launched on Nov. 30th, 2022. Of course, in FY25 its net income was up 788% vs. FY23 (ended 1/23) and revenues are up 384% since then too. Just doesn't feel right, does it?\" Reitzes said in a note last week, noting that Apple stock experienced a similar trajectory in 2008 before the stock rebounded.\"If Nvidia duplicates its own version of this industry stewardship, we could look back at this period of uncertainty and have a good chuckle,\" he added.Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said he is bullish on the stock heading into the GTC conference. He's expecting the company to give key updates on Blackwell, as well as Rubin, the chip following Blackwell in Nvidia's product cycle.Updates on Blackwell could be particularly impactful, Rasgon suggested, adding that he believed the chip could represent the \"biggest product cycle\" in the history of the company.Over the last 10 years, when investors bought Nvidia at similar valuation levels, gains have always been positive over the next 12-month period, he added.\"I really like it at these valuations,\" Rasgon told CNBC last week.Investors have been anxious about the strength of the AI trade in recent months since DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, appeared to create an AI model to to rival US peers despite claiming to use older and cheaper GPUs to train it. Mega-cap tech shares have also been hit the hardest by the recent bout of tariff-induced volatility that sent the S&P 500 into correction last week. Read the original article on Business Insider",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is reportedly working to make sure the chip maker has a secure foundation in case the demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) systems slows down. The AI boom has made Nvidia a multitrillion-dollar company and Huang the world’s 15th-wealthiest person, Bloomberg reported Friday (March 14). At the same time, Huang is aware that tech infrastructure companies’ products can become commodities and that there is a history of the industry experiencing booms and busts, according to the report. Nvidia is already seeing competitors try to undercut its price, customers try to build their own chips, tariffs cause complications and national security concerns threaten sales to China, the report said. In addition, the recent debut of an AI model from DeepSeek that claimed to be as powerful as its competitors while costing much less, led to concerns that the AI boom has peaked, per the report. After the debut of that model, Nvidia experienced the biggest single-day drop in market ever seen by a company: almost $600 billion. With Nvidia’s annual conference set to be held next week, it is expected that Huang will highlight the company’s wide-ranging efforts to find “the next frontier in AI,” according to the report. The company aims to build not only chips but also software that will deliver benefits in a variety of industries and encourage other companies to continue making large investments in AI, per the report. The Bloomberg report came after a Feb. 26 earnings call in which Huang said that sales of the company’s most advanced chip architecture hit a record in the fourth quarter and that these results were a harbinger of even more demand ahead because the AI era has just begun. “AI is advancing at light speed,” Huang said during the call. “We’re just at the start of the age of AI.” Huang said the world is just two years into the current wave of AI advancements, starting with generative AI, which powered consumer use of AI, and is now moving into AI agents, which will power business use of AI. Following these two trends, he sees the next stage is physical AI like robots. “AI has gone mainstream” and one day it will be embedded in all industries, Huang said.

A new generation of AI models is squeezing more power out of fewer chips. Whether they spark another DeepSeek-scale panic for Nvidia is another matter.Google led the charge this week with a collection of smaller models — Gemma 3 — that appear to pack a serious punch with a standout feat: they run smoothly with just a single Nvidia chip, known as a GPU.Unveiling the models Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted their efficiency in an X post, writing that \"you'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models.\"Cohere, a Toronto-headquartered startup led by former Googler Aidan Gomez, also released a new model on Thursday called Command A, which is described as a \"state-of-the-art\" model that runs on just two GPUs. (Business Insider, alongside other publishers, has sued Cohere over copyright infringement.)One of the key lessons DeepSeek imparted to the world when it released an AI model in January was the ability to do more with less. The Chinese startup said its R1 model was competitive with OpenAI's o1 model while claiming it needed fewer chips.The claim triggered the biggest single-day wipeout in US stock market history, in which Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in value. The market wondered if more efficient AI would reduce demand for Nvidia chips — demand that helped it achieve a record full-year revenue in 2024 of $130.5 billion.At first glance, this new wave of AI models seems to pose an even greater threat, as they claim to be state-of-the-art while only needing a handful of GPUs to run.A chart of Gemma's performance on the industry leaderboard Chatbot Arena, for instance — shared by Pichai — showed the model outperformed those from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta while being run on fewer GPUs.Gemma 3 is here!

The economic principle suggests that as technology becomes more efficient, consumption of that technology will increase — not decrease.It might help explain why Google itself has said it plans to increase its AI-related capital expenditure this year to $75 billion, which typically includes the GPUs housed in the data centers critical for AI.Google has been one of the main buyers of the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs — the Blackwell chips introduced last year — so it's plausible to expect them to be among those ready to spend on the new GPU Nvidia is expected to unveil at its GTC event next week.So far, the market does not appear to be worried by the latest chip efficiency developments — Nvidia's share price is up about 6% since Tuesday. There is a small caveat to this.While Google's new Gemma models can use a single Nvidia GPU to run on, it appears the training of the new models took place with Google's own chips, known as tensor processing units, or TPUs.Tech giants like Google have spent years working on their own silicon as a means of reducing their dependence on Nvidia, so Gemma poses a curious situation in which Google has produced a competitive AI model without using any Nvidia GPUs for training.Still, it's unlikely that a company like Google will reduce its dependence on Nvidia GPUs in a significant way anytime soon — and for a simple reason.The company's push to produce more efficient models is happening alongside its development of more powerful, large-scale Gemini AI models that aim to push the boundaries of intelligence. These models' success, for now, depends on getting access to as much compute as possible.This approach was recently validated by the release of Grok 3, the latest frontier AI model from Elon Musk's startup. Its release came with a note that said a future version of the model would be trained on a larger, 200,000 GPU cluster.The future of AI development, then, looks like one in which two different paths emerge in tandem: one in which smaller, more efficient models emerge that run on fewer GPUs, and another in which large-scale models continue to have as many GPUs thrown at them as possible.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in value over fears that more efficient AI would mean lower demand for its chips.

        "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su.I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images; BIWhen a top analyst skewered AMD's software, CEO Lisa Su called him personally to chat.AMD's AI chips have struggled to compete against Nvidia's dominance, and software is its weakness.Those who know Su told Business Insider she will never settle for second place.What should a CEO do when their company is publicly called out for an inferior product? Many would stay silent. Not AMD CEO Lisa Su.In early February, AMD released new data showing how well its AI chips performed at training large language models, using benchmarks developed by a company called SemiAnalysis. Just weeks earlier, the same group had published a searing review of AMD's tentpole graphics processing unit.The analysts wrote that while the chip looks good on paper, reaching its potential in reality was almost impossible with AMD's existing software. Chief analyst Dylan Patel and the SemiAnalysis team spent five months assessing AMD's GPU, which has struggled to gain market share and mindshare against the dominant player, Nvidia.\"We were hopeful that AMD could emerge as a strong competitor to Nvidia in training workloads, but, as of today, this is unfortunately not the case,\" SemiAnalysis published in December.The next day, Patel got a call from Su. The call was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it lasted 90.\"Feedback is a gift even when it's critical,\" Su tweeted after the call. The new performance data released in February were a punch back in a fight that's far from over.2024 was the year of Lisa Su. She was Time and Chief Executive Magazine's CEO of the year.Last year, AMD outsold Intel in its data center business, overtaking its old rival in the traditional data center world. This became the triumphant apex of Su's first decade as CEO of AMD. Revenue for the whole of 2024 was up 14% year over year — gross profits up 22% — and yet when Su reported the results in February, the stock went down.As Su achieved what many thought impossible and conquered her old foil, Intel, a new one had already presented itself in AI prognosticator Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, Su's cousin born in the same region of Taiwan as her. Shareholders wouldn't let her forget her biggest rival.Whether AMD can meet the seemingly insurmountable challenge of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share may come down to the approaches of two Taiwanese-born, US-educated, distantly-related CEOs.Su has already stated the company's goals. She's leaning into open-source software and beefing up support for large language model training and inference customers. Most importantly, she's raising the bar for AMD's software so that it can better stand up to Nvidia's — since Huang has long professed that software is Nvidia's secret sauce.\"We are still in the very early stages with AI, and we believe there's no one-size-fits-all approach to AI compute,\" an AMD spokesperson told Business Insider. AMD declined to make Su available for an interview.BI spoke with nine people for this story — five of whom have at one point had a personal relationship with Su and three of whom worked under her at AMD. They said that whether in 2007, 2017, or 2027, the stoic, thoughtful, quietly confident executive walking the brightest stages in the tech world is exactly who she seems. Though she may never conquer Nvidia, she won't rest while she's in the number two spot. Her play involves intently listening to partners as well as critics, and it's worked before.AMD CEO Lisa Su's public presentation style has changed since she took over the company in 2014.AMDLisa Su says, 'Why not?'Some early indications suggested that starting at the bottom motivated Su to get to the top.Born in Taiwan and raised in New York, Su intentionally picked the most challenging STEM field she could think of: electrical engineering. After earning her doctorate, she received multiple offers to stay in academia but decided to join Texas Instruments instead, Dimitri Antoniadis, her MIT thesis advisor, told BI. She wanted to manage people and projects, she recently told Stanford business students. After leaving TI for IBM, she was tapped to serve as a technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and CEO.Antoniadis recalled late-night phone conversations with Su when she was at these \"juncture points\" in her career. She left IBM in 2007, spent four and a half years at Freescale Semiconductor, and then came to AMD in 2012.The professor got one such call in late 2014. Su had managed AMD's various business units and operations for nearly three years — deep in the weeds of the entire company yet without the authority to set the overall direction. She called Antoniadis when she was asked to take the CEO job, which meant going after a market dominated by Intel. The original Silicon Valley icon had a market capitalization of over $150 billion and a reputation for ruthlessness. AMD's market cap was just $2 billion.\"At the time, I said, 'Lisa, are you serious? Taking on Intel?' She said, 'Why not?'\" Antoniadis told BI.Su sought multiple opinions on the big decision to head AMD. Lip-Bu Tan, a legendary semiconductor CEO turned investor who will step into the Intel CEO role on March 18, was also on the call list. Tan and Su met years earlier when she was at Freescale Semiconductor, and he was impressed from the start, he told BI.Tan was fully aware of AMD's sad state at the time. The firm had completed two rounds of layoffs since 2011 and pulled out of the processor market. The company needed focus.\"Only the gaming business was doing well. The rest were struggling,\" Tan said. Despite this, he didn't hesitate to recommend the job to Su. He had just orchestrated a revival of a similar magnitude at Cadence Design Systems and knew the opportunity such a turnaround could be.\"The market value was less than $3 billion — you can't go wrong with that. It is so undervalued,\" Tan said of AMD.Su took over AMD on October 8, 2014. A 7% staff cut proceeded, and Su set out to make long-term bets and win back customers. Tan said Su soon had top tech execs like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Dell COO Jeff Clarke trusting her, mainly due to her hands-on style. Even for routine annual business reviews, Su knows all the numbers and listens intently to concerns, sources said.\"They love her. She is very engaged — very involved,\" Tan said.Su has evolved her style over her 10 years as CEO of AMD. She's somewhat less stoic, makes jokes onstage, wears brighter colors, has more perfectly coiffed hair, and has come to appreciate Christian Louboutin heels. AMD declined to comment on these details.\"I am not surprised at all where she is right now. I truly expected it,\" Antoniadis told BI.AMD's market cap has grown to about $160 billion as of Wednesday — much higher than its $2 billion market cap when Su first started. This month, all AI stocks have taken a dive amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policy shifts.Now, Su has a new miracle to perform.Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.AMDSu v. HuangIn 2018, Su sat with a handful of Wall Street analysts in a private meeting space near the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest tech conferences of the year, bustled in the massive building's halls.Su was just over three years into her job as CEO of AMD, and the company's stock hovered above just $10 per share.The analysts in that Las Vegas conference room had a lot of advice for the then 48-year-old CEO, according to a person present, who asked not to be named since the session was private. The room was full of men eager to tell Su how to seize on her progress and take AMD to the next level. There was chatter in the nerdier accelerated computing circles that machine learning was ready to scale, and the analysts weren't sure AMD was seeing the signs.Su took it all in and politely thanked everyone. She knew accelerated computing would change the world as early as 2017, she has since said in interviews. The graphics processing unit made that possible.At the time, the entertainment industry used them for gaming and graphics rendering. While AMD has designed this kind of hardware for two decades, Nvidia's Huang beat the entire tech industry to the punch when he identified the AI opportunity for GPUs and started building software to help it spread. Since ChatGPT's birth, Nvidia and AMD have been in an epic race — only Nvidia had a massive head start.Both Huang and Su are notoriously hardworking — late nights and weekends are a given.But Huang is a showman. He dominates a stage whether it be at the front of a boardroom or a concert arena. Su is less flashy. She rarely, if ever, raises her voice, and her business strategy echoes that quiet, inexhaustible, confident consistency, sources said.\"You know she's in charge, but she's also a very quiet leader,\" said Jodi Shelton, cofounder and CEO of the Global Semiconductor Alliance. Shelton recalled an intimate dinner at Su's Texas home with just the CEO and her husband, Daniel Lin, where Su asked most of the questions.\"She doesn't need to interject when someone's speaking. She doesn't have to be the loudest person in the room,\" Shelton continued.Onstage, Su often paces, making measured announcements. At team meetings, she drills for answers about what needs to be done next and delegates tasks, personally reviewing AMD's GPU distribution on spreadsheets, the AMD employees said.In a world where CEOs like former Intel leader Pat Gelsinger have announced plans such as five nodes in four years and fell short in execution, AMD has slowly marched forward. Even Nvidia's yearly cadence of new GPU generations has hit production and installation snags. Su is wary of overpromising and underexecuting, several sources said. Execution is non-negotiable.\"That's not very easy for people to do for such a long time,\" Lamini founder Sharon Zhou, who has committed to AMD hardware over Nvidia, told BI. \"Which is why I think she presents the main threat to",

        "description": "Nvidia's 50-series refresh has been pretty conservative so far. Nvidia has launched all of the GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs that it announced at CES, at least technically—whether you're buying from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel, it's nearly impossible to find any of these new cards at their advertised prices right now. But hope springs eternal, and newly leaked specs for GeForce RTX 5060 and 5050-series cards suggest that Nvidia may be announcing these lower-end cards soon. These kinds of cards are rarely exciting, but Steam Hardware Survey data shows that these xx60 and xx50 cards are what the overwhelming majority of PC gamers are putting in their systems. The specs, posted by a reliable leaker named Kopite and reported by Tom's Hardware and others, suggest a refresh that's in line with what Nvidia has done with most of the 50-series so far. Along with a move to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, the 5060 GPUs each come with a small increase to the number of CUDA cores, a jump from GDDR6 to GDDR7, and an increase in power consumption, but no changes to the amount of memory or the width of the memory bus. The 8GB versions, in particular, will probably continue to be marketed primarily as 1080p cards.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Nvidia's trailing 12-month P/E ratio dropped on Monday to its lowest level since August 2019. Anna Kim/Getty, Tyler Le/BINvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is now lower than when ChatGPT launched in 2022.The decline comes amid a broad decline in semiconductor stocks. Nvidia shares are down 30% from their 52-week high.Melius Research remains optimistic on Nvidia ahead of its conference next week.A closely watched valuation indicator for Nvidia has fallen to levels not seen since before the launch of ChatGPT.Nvidia's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio dropped to 36.4 times on Monday, according to data from YCharts. The decline has been driven by a sharp price decline in Nvidia's stock, which finished Monday down 30% from its intraday record high reached in early January.The valuation multiple decline makes Nvidia cheaper today than it was when ChatGPT was first released on November 30, 2022. The stock is trading at its cheapest level since August 2019.Ben Reitzes, managing director at Melius Research, said the valuation dynamic for Nvidia also holds true on a forward P/E ratio, which incorporates Wall Street's year-ahead earnings estimates for the company.According to Reitzes, with a forward P/E ratio of 24 times, Nvidia stock is 41% cheaper than it was when ChatGPT launched.Melius ResearchIt's an impressive feat given that Nvidia shares have soared 583% since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the masses.In this case, the stock-price surge was backed up by profits, as Nvidia's GPU business boomed due to strong demand from AI companies. Nvidia's net income in the fiscal year 2025 soared 788% compared to the fiscal year 2023, which ended in January 2023.Reitzes believes there's a valuation disconnect and said in a note on Monday that the risks have largely priced into semiconductor stocks like Nvidia.\"We remain very optimistic,\" Reitzes said.Part of the optimism stems from Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference next week, where CEO Jensen Huang is expected to assure investors that the AI boom remains alive and well and unveil its product roadmap into 2027, according to Reitzes.Another reason Reitzes is staying bullish on Nvidia is because he's seen this valuation compression play out before in shares of a technology stalwart: Apple.\"A similar thing happened to Apple actually a long time ago, when its forward multiple went from 33 times on the day it announced the iPhone in 2008 and shrank to 15 times by the end of 2008 in the crisis,\" Reitzes said.\"As you know, the mobile trend didn't end then — and Apple now trades at 31x earnings on much larger numbers. If Nvidia duplicates its own version of this industry stewardship, we could look back at this period of uncertainty and have a good chuckle,\" he added.Melius Research rates Nvidia at \"Buy\" with a $170 price target, representing potential upside of 60% from current levels.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Bryce Adelstein Lelbach says Nvidia doesn't employ a strict hierarchy, and has a free-form culture.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesBryce Adelstein Lelbach, a principal architect at Nvidia, discussed the company's culture in a recent podcast interview.He described it as \"organized chaos\" and said it best fits self-starters with lots of initiative.Lelbach said that the kind of flexibility Nvidia's culture has afforded him is \"really valuable.\"If you're highly driven and independently motivated, you might be a culture fit for Nvidia.\"I sometimes describe it as, it's a little bit of, you know, organized chaos, which I really like,\" Nvidia's principal architect Bryce Adelstein Lelbach said in a recent podcast interview with TechBytes.Nvidia has rapidly gained a reputation as one of the companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, and positions at the company are highly coveted — both for the associated prestige and potential financial upside.Those who do make the cut should brace themselves — as Lelbach says Nvidia assigns new hires real responsibility from day one. He added that it could feel, to some, like being thrown into the deep end.\"I think that for some people it could be quite scary if, you know, you start day one at Nvidia and usually it's like, 'Okay, here's a laptop and like here's a pile of bugs that you're responsible for. Good luck,'\" Lelbach said.Still, he added, things are likely to work out well for those who are used to being self-sufficient.\"There's not necessarily like a lot of structured onboarding. It sort of depends, team by team,\" Lelbach said. \"But if you're a self-starter, if you've got a lot of initiative, it's a great environment for you.\"Lelbach says Nvidia has a relatively \"flat management structure\" — meaning that the company has fewer layers of management separating executives from employees.

He added that it could feel, to some, like being thrown into the deep end.\"I think that for some people it could be quite scary if, you know, you start day one at Nvidia and usually it's like, 'Okay, here's a laptop and like here's a pile of bugs that you're responsible for. Good luck,'\" Lelbach said.Still, he added, things are likely to work out well for those who are used to being self-sufficient.\"There's not necessarily like a lot of structured onboarding. It sort of depends, team by team,\" Lelbach said. \"But if you're a self-starter, if you've got a lot of initiative, it's a great environment for you.\"Lelbach says Nvidia has a relatively \"flat management structure\" — meaning that the company has fewer layers of management separating executives from employees. CEO Jensen Huang has previously said he manages about 50 to 60 direct reports himself.\"I really love the Nvidia culture because Nvidia does not have a lot of strict hierarchy or rules.

By providing full data control with maximum resilience in edge computing applications, the new platform gives system designers unprecedented abilities to develop high-performance computing systems for industrial applications. At the heart of the JetSys-2010 is the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX SoM with 16 GB and the NVIDIA JetPack software development kit (SDK). Developers can benefit from NVIDIA’s rich suite of AI tools and the NVIDIA JetPack SDK, which is a complete solution to accelerate end-to-end AI application development. The SDK also includes the Jetson Linux board support package (BSP), the Jetson AI Stack, and Jetson Platform Services to streamline AI application development. Holger Heidenblut, Edge AI expert at Elma Electronic, noted, “The JetSys-2010 closes a major gap in the rugged computing market by offering a highly reliable and low-maintenance AI processing platform directly at the point of use. It enables our customers to retain full, local control over AI data without the need to go to the cloud, no matter the conditions on the ground.” The JetSys-2010 stands out with its innovative passive cooling, designed for applications where environmental protection is critical, like mining, robotics, agriculture, and autonomous vehicles. It is also well suited for industrial applications at the edge, like robotics, automation and networked mobility solutions. Typical implementations include predictive maintenance, anomaly detection and automatic quality control. To comply with requirements for use in railway implementations, the JetSys-2010 is designed to meet EN50155, and is ready for use in rugged transportation applications. The JetSys-2010 ships standard with two Gigabit Ethernet ports, USB and LAN. A wide range of common interfaces are available, including RS232, RS485, CANbus and user-defined I/O. Additional interfaces include maintenance ports, like USB-Console or a DVI port and an optional extension and IO-ready GSML camera interfaces. The unit ships with either 1TB M.2 or M.2 2242 SSD storage and is powered by a railway-compliant power supply. The JetSys-2010 will be available starting in April 2025.

        "description": "Broadcom's custom AI chips appeal to cloud companies as a cheaper option for high-volume AI work. Broadcom CEO Hock E. Tan.Lucas Jackson/ReutersBroadcom's AI revenue surged 77% year-over-year, boosting its stock after a volatile 2025 so far.Broadcom's custom AI chips, designed with cloud companies, offer lower-cost options than Nvidia.Analysts predict the ASIC market will nearly double this year.No matter where Nvidia executives go, they get questions about custom AI chips. Broadcom just made sure that's not going to stop anytime soon.Broadcom released quarterly earnings Thursday to a soaring market reaction and glowing reviews — largely thanks to its AI business.Broadcom burst into the mainstream AI conversation in December when it ballooned into the $1 trillion market cap club for the first time. Like most AI stocks, Broadcom has had a volatile 2025, though the stock jumped more than 10% after hours Thursday after the company reported $4.1 billion in AI revenue in the last quarter — a 77% uptick in revenue compared to the same period last year.Broadcom, led by CEO Hock Tan, is one of the top players in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) business. These custom AI chips are generally designed in partnership with cloud companies and aren't as versatile as Nvidia's coveted chips. They're designed to perform specific, high-volume AI tasks at a much lower cost.As AI workloads grow and scale, analysts expect ASICs to be an increasingly attractive option for customers, which, even as they build their custom programs, are often still placing large orders with Nvidia.Morgan Stanley analysts have forecast that the market for ASICs will nearly double to $22 billion this year. Broadcom projected its own AI business with its three largest hyperscaler customers would bring in between $60 billion and $90 billion in the next two years.Synovus senior portfolio manager Dan Morgan wrote to investors Thursday that Broadcom is a \"compelling way to play\" in AI investment since it is \"less volatile than the merchant AGI race.\"Analysts say Broadcom's largest customers for AI chips are Google, ByteDance, and Meta. Tan said the company is engaged with an additional four, though he hesitated to call them customers on the call. He highlighted the difference between developing and testing a new chip and ordering it at scale for deployment.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had a similar warning in his remarks last week during the company's earnings call.\"Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again,\" Huang said.When asked about the competitive threat from ASICs, Huang said, \"We're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere.\"The story for custom chips isn't quite uniform. Marvell, another prominent player that makes Amazon's custom AI chips, missed expectations in its earnings report Wednesday.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "For $549 and $599, AMD comes close to knocking out Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070. AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its early-2010s nadir partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money and later with CPUs that were better than anything Intel could offer. Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are also pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies. Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesNvidia releases earnings quarterly.On calls with investors, CEO Jensen Huang answers questions about the underlying trends impacting AI.The company's latest earnings call was dominated by its next-gen Blackwell GPU and profit margins.Nvidia, the company behind the GPUs that enable AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok, releases its earnings quarterly.Typically, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress walks investors through the quarterly results.Then, co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang answers questions on the calls, offering insights into the underlying trends of artificial intelligence, data centers, and gaming.The calls usually cover topics like Nvidia's stock price moves the revenue of Nvidia's GPU chips, which are transitioning to the next-generation Blackwell architecture.Here's a breakdown of Nvidia's recent earnings.Nvidia's Q4 earnings 2025During Nvidia's Q4 earnings call, the chipmaker reported a surge in business, reporting year-over-year revenue growth of 78% at $39.33 billion for the quarter, beating estimates of $38.25 billion.While Nvidia beat analyst's revenue and profit forecasts and raised its forward-looking guidance, that wasn't enough to meet Wall Street's sky-high expectations.The potential impact of DeepSeek—a lower-cost AI model from a Chinese startup—on Nvidia's future chip demand was top of mind for investors. Nvidia said DeepSeek was driving an increase in demand for its inferencing solutions.One concern for investors was the company's profit margins, which were slightly weaker than expected due to its ramp in production of its Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia said it did not expect its profit margins to recover until the second half of the year.There are also concerns that Nvidia's growth is slowing and top cloud customers could be nearing a peak in their capital expenditures for AI chips.

Nvidia said DeepSeek was driving an increase in demand for its inferencing solutions.One concern for investors was the company's profit margins, which were slightly weaker than expected due to its ramp in production of its Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia said it did not expect its profit margins to recover until the second half of the year.There are also concerns that Nvidia's growth is slowing and top cloud customers could be nearing a peak in their capital expenditures for AI chips.

        "description": "On Monday, reports surfaced that Nvidia chips were making their way to customers in China, with the high-end tech circumventing strict US export controls. Michael M. Santiago/Getty, Tyler Le/BINvidia shares fell 8% Monday, deepening a bear market trend that's taken hold since early January.The latest tumble follows concerns over Nvidia's Q4 earnings and profit margin expectations.Reports of Nvidia's AI chips reaching China despite export controls added to investor worries on Monday.Nvidia's stock plunge deepened on Monday, with the stock down as much as 8% in the session to trade at $114.51.Shares of the artificial intelligence GPU maker officially entered a bear market last week, down more than 20% from their intra-day highs reached in early January. The losses have intensified over the past week. The stock is down 18% in seven days, dropping sharply from a February 20 closing price of $140.11. Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report last week kickstarted the latest period of weakness for the stock. While the report beat analyst estimates and included solid forward-looking guidance, it didn't meet Wall Street's most lofty expectations and raised concerns about profit margins.On Monday, investors also appeared to be worried about reports that Nvidia's overseas AI chip sales are leaking into China.The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese tech companies are getting their hands on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs despite strict US export controls.According to the report, a Blackwell server containing eight AI GPUs could fetch over $600,000 in China, while the firm's previous-generation Hopper server could sell for about $250,000 in the country.Black market traders in China are securing the chips through intermediaries in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore, the report said.Bloomberg also reported on Nvidia's overseas chip sales on Monday, noting that Singapore launched a fraud investigation into whether servers shipped from Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer to Malaysia housed Nvidia chips that are barred from entering China.As traders digest Nvidia's stock's latest drop on Monday, technical signals are flashing a warning sign.Nvidia shares fell short of an important resistance level around $130, and are now trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "\"While unwelcome, volatility is common in semi stocks and does not always presage a fundamental shift,\" Bank of America said. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BINvidia's post-earnings drop dented hopes for a fresh AI rally, but two firms could revive the trade this week. The PHLX Semiconductor Index fell 7.2% after Nvidia's results were met with tepid investor response. BofA expects earnings from Broadcom and Marvell to possibly drum up fresh excitement on Wall Street. Last week's post-earnings sell-off in Nvidia shares dashed investor hopes of a revived artificial intelligence trade, but earnings for two AI names this week could generate fresh enthusiasm. That's according to Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who highlighted Broadcom and Marvell Technologies' upcoming earnings reports as potential catalysts to watch, saying that they could \"re-energize interest\" in semiconductor names. The PHLX Semiconductor Index dropped 7.2% last week after Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings report failed to meet Wall Street's highest expectations.Shares of the AI GPU maker entered a bear market correction last week, with the stock down 22% from its record high reached in early January.But Arya says investors should get used to the volatility, as these types of declines are normal.\"While unwelcome, volatility is common in semi stocks and does not always presage a fundamental shift,\" Arya said, adding that the semiconductor index has experienced 21 different 5% or more weekly declines since 2021 even as it cumulatively increased by 71%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's return of 59%.Arya ultimately sees the latest volatility subsiding, as the fundamentals are too strong to ignore.That dynamic could be on display on Wednesday and Thursday, when Marvell Technology and Broadcom are scheduled to report quarterly results. Arya sees both companies, which are among his top five picks for 2025, beating analyst earnings estimates and raising their full-year guidance.Arya's conviction in the AI stocks stems from the sky-high capital expenditure commitments from cloud companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, most of which will be spent on AI-related hardware.Additionally, Arya said the ongoing \"battle of AI chatbots\" benefits AI hardware makers, as it drives demand for training and inference chips, and as business models develop, should soothe investor fears about the return on high AI spending. Here's what Arya had to say about Broadcom and Marvell's upcoming earnings reports.Broadcom: \"We expect management to restress the $60-$90 billion long-term SAM in custom chips and networking, with growing engagement with new partners (we think OpenAI, Apple).\"Marvell: \"Recovery in telco, enterprise, and solid demand for AI chips by customer Amazon and continued growth in AI optics could drive upside to consensus. Separately we expect MRVL to grow with Amazon even in CY26 on continued participation in custom chip program.\"Arya rates Broadcom and Marvell at \"Buy\" with respective price targets of $250 and $150.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Intel is rising on a report that two leading AI names are running manufacturing tests using Intel's chip-making technology. credit should read LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesIntel stock rose nearly 6% on Monday on a report Nvidia and Broadcom could use the firm's tech. Reuters reported that the two chip giants are running manufacturing tests at Intel's foundry.The move would be an important endorsement for the embattled hardware firm.The move: Intel rose 6% to $25.18 per share on Monday morning. The jump puts the stock on track to recoup losses after a drop of about 4.5% last week. The chart: Why: Sources told Reuters that Nvidia and Broadcom, two leading chipmakers, are running manufacturing tests with Intel. If successful, this could be the hardware company's first step to unlocking lucrative manufacturing deals with two firms at the heart of the artificial intelligence trade. Both tests utilize Intel's 18A manufacturing process, used to develop advanced AI processors and other high-grade tech. Advanced Micro Devices is also looking into Intel's 18A process for its own needs, Reuters added.What it means: Rising interest from top AI chipmakers would be a strong endorsement for Intel, and could help shore up a stock that has dropped well below last year's highs. While the stock is up about 18% year-to-date, it has fallen 43% in a year. Layoffs and buyouts have pushed investors away from the tech giant over the past year, a retreat made worse as the company fell behind on AI. Most recently, the chipmaker announced that plans for a manufacturing plant in Ohio have been delayed until 2030 — initially, it was to start operating as soon as this year.While the Nvidia and Broadcom tests are a needed vote of confidence, it's not a guaranteed win for Intel. Testing can last months and may still result in disappointing conclusions. According to Reuters, that much occurred last year, with Broadcom executives let down by a batch of tests at the Intel foundry.The latest move is also a fresh boost for the company after another bright spot in February after US Vice President JD Vance pledged to boost US chip production.
