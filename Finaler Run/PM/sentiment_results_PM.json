        "sentiment": "positive",
        "explanation": "A declared dividend provides immediate shareholder value and often acts as a short-term sentiment trigger, prompting buying pressure.

        "explanation": "Backing guidance during a conference presentation signals stability and management's confidence in the company's near-term prospects.

        "sentiment": "positive",
        "explanation": "The title \"Philip Morris is still blazing hot with analysts and quant scores despite being at an all-time high\" suggests continued positive sentiment from key market participants.

        "sentiment": "positive",
        "explanation": "Being highlighted in a \"top picks list\" from a reputable firm like Morgan Stanley acts as a positive sentiment trigger. This could drive short-term buying pressure based on the perceived endorsement, regardless of whether it's fundamentally justified, pushing the price up within the 60-minute window.

        "explanation": "The news of Coatue Management taking a new stake in Philip Morris is unlikely to have a significant immediate (60-minute) impact. While portfolio adjustments by large funds can sometimes signal confidence, this news lacks a strong, immediate catalyst to drive price action.

While this may indirectly indicate increased demand for nicotine pouches, it doesn't directly impact PM's immediate revenue or operations in the next 60 minutes.
