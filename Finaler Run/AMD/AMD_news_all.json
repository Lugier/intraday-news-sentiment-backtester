CDNA 4 is AMD’s latest compute oriented GPU architecture, and represents a modest update over CDNA 3. CDNA 4’s focus is primarily on boosting AMD’s matrix multiplication performance with lower precision data types. Those operations are important for machine learning workloads, which can often maintain acceptable accuracy with very low precision types. At the same time, CDNA 4 seeks to maintain AMD’s lead in more widely applicable vector operations.To do so, CDNA 4 largely uses the same system level architecture as CDNA 3. It’s massive chiplet setup, with parallels to AMD’s successful use of chiplets for CPU products. Accelerator Compute Dies, or XCDs, contain CDNA Compute Units and serve a role analogous to Core Complex Dies (CCDs) on AMD’s CPU products. Eight XCDs sit atop four base dies, which implement 256 MB of memory side cache. AMD’s Infinity Fabric provides coherent memory access across the system, which can span multiple chips.Compared to the CDNA 3 based MI300X, the CDNA 4 equipped MI355X slightly cuts down CU count per XCD, and disables more CUs to maintain yields. The resulting GPU is somewhat less wide, but makes up much of the gap with higher clock speeds. Compared to Nvidia’s B200, both MI355X and MI300 are larger GPUs with far more basic building blocks. Nvidia’s B200 does adopt a multi-die strategy, breaking from a long tradition of using monolithic designs. However, AMD’s chiplet setup is far more aggressive and seeks to replicate their scaling success with CPU designs with large compute GPUs.Compute Unit ChangesCDNA 3 provided a huge vector throughput advantage over Nvidia’s H100, but faced a more complicated situation with machine learning workloads. Thanks to a mature software ecosystem and a heavy focus on matrix multiplication throughput (tensor cores), Nvidia could often get close (",

        "description": "Today, AMD’s Infinity Fabric interconnect is ubiquitous across the company’s lineup. Today, AMD’s Infinity Fabric interconnect is ubiquitous across the company’s lineup. Infinity Fabric provides well-defined interfaces to a transport layer, and lets different functional blocks treat the interconnect as a black box. The system worked well enough to let AMD create integrated GPU products all the way from the Steam Deck’s tiny van Gogh APU, to giant systems packing four MI300A chips. Across all those offerings, Infinity Fabric enables coherent memory access as CPU and GPU requests converge to Coherent Slaves (CS-es), which have a probe filter and can request data from the appropriate source.AMD was also trying to build powerful iGPUs over a decade ago, but their interconnect looked very different at the time. Their Northbridge architecture owes its name to the Athlon 64 era, when AMD brought the chipset northbridge’s functionality onto the CPU die. AMD’s engineers likely didn’t envision needing to tightly integrate a GPU during Athlon 64’s development, so the interconnect was designed to tie together a few CPU cores and service memory requests with low latency. But then AMD acquired ATI, and set about trying to take advantage of their new graphics talent by building powerful iGPUs.“Trinity” is an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) from 2012. It combines two dual-threaded Piledriver CPU modules with a 6-SIMD Terascale 3 iGPU. Here I’ll be looking into AMD’s second generation iGPU interconnect with the A8-5600K, a slightly cut-down Trinity implementation with four Terascale 3 SIMDs enabled and CPU boost clocks dropped from 4.2 to 3.9 GHz. I’m testing the chip on a MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 board with 16 GB of Kingston DDR3-1866 10-10-9-26 memory.Trinity’s on-die network resembles that of AMD’s first APU, Llano, and has clear similarities to AMD’s Athlon 64 Northbridge. The Northbridge sits on a separate voltage and frequency domain, and runs at 1.8 GHz on the A8-5600K. It uses a two-level crossbar setup. CPU cores connect to a System Request Interface (SRI), which routes requests onto a set of queues. Most memory requests head to a System Request Queue (SRQ). The SRI also accepts incoming probes on a separate queue, and routes them to the CPU cores. A second level crossbar, simply called the XBAR, connects with the SRI’s various queues and routes requests to IO and memory. The XBAR can handle IO-to-IO communication too, though such traffic is rare on consumer systems.On Trinity, the XBAR’s scheduler (XCS) has 40 entries, making it slightly smaller than the 64 entry XCS on desktop and server Piledriver chips. AMD defaults to a 22+10+8 entry split between the SRI, Memory Controller (MCT),and upstream channel, though the BIOS can opt for a different XCS entry allocation. The XBAR sends memory requests to the MCT, which prioritizes requests based on type and age, and includes a strided-access prefetcher. Like Infinity Fabric’s CS, the MCT is responsible for ensuring cache coherency and can send probes back to the XBAR. The MCT also translates physical addresses to “normalized” addresses that only cover the memory space backed by DRAM.All AMD CPUs from Trinity’s era use a similar SRI+XBAR setup, but Trinity’s iGPU sets it apart from CPU-only products. The iGPU gets its own Graphics Memory Controller (GMC), which arbitrates between different request types and schedules requests to maximize DRAM bandwidth utilization. Thus the GMC performs an analogous role to the MCT on the CPU side. A “Radeon Memory Bus” connects the GMC to the DRAM controllers, bypassing the MCT. AMD documentation occasionally refers to the Radeon Memory Bus as “Garlic”, likely a holdover from internal names used during Llano’s development.A second control link hooks the GPU into the XBAR, much like any other IO device. Previously, the control link was called the “Fusion Control Link”, or “Onion”. I’ll use “Garlic” and “Onion” to refer to the two links because those names are shorter.The “Garlic” Link (Radeon Memory Bus)Trinity’s “Garlic” link lets the GPU saturate DRAM bandwidth. It bypasses the MCT and therefore bypasses the Northbridge’s cache coherency mechanisms. That’s a key design feature, because CPUs and GPUs usually don’t share data. Snooping the CPU caches for GPU memory requests would waste power and flood the interconnect with probes, most of which would miss.Bypassing the MCT also skips the Northbridge’s regular memory prioritization mechanism, so the MCT and GMC have various mechanisms to keep the CPU and GPU from starving each other of memory bandwidth. First, the MCT and GMC can limit how many outstanding requests they have on the DRAM controller queues (DCQs). Then, the DCQs can alternate between accepting requests from the MCT and GMC, or can be set to prioritize the requester with fewer outstanding requests. Trinity defaults to the former. Finally, because the CPU tends to be more latency sensitive, Trinity can prioritize MCT-side reads ahead of GMC requests. Some of this arbitration seems to happen at queues in front of the DCQ. AMD’s BIOS and Kernel Developer’s Guide (BKDG) indicates there’s a 4-bit read pointer for a sideband signal FIFO between the GMC and DCT, so the “Garlic” link may have a queue with up to 16 entries.From software testing, Trinity does a good job controlling CPU-side latency under increasing GPU bandwidth demand. Even with the GPU hitting the DRAM controllers with over 24 GB/s of reads and writes, CPU latency remains under 120 ns. Loaded latency can actually get worse under CPU-only bandwidth contention, even though Trinity’s CPU side isn’t capable of fully saturating the memory controller. When testing loaded latency, I have to reserve one thread for running the latency test, so bandwidth in the graph above tops out at just over 17 GB/s. Running bandwidth test threads across all four CPU logical threads would give ~20.1 GB/s.Mixing CPU and GPU bandwidth load shows that latency goes up when there’s more CPU-side bandwidth. Again, the GPU can pull a lot of bandwidth without impacting CPU memory latency too heavily. Likely, there’s more contention at the SRI and XBAR than at the DRAM controllers.Control Link, and Cache Coherency (Or Not)Integrated GPUs raise the prospect of doing zero-copy data sharing between the CPU and GPU, without being constrained by a PCIe bus. Data sharing is conceptually easy, but cache coherency is not, and caching is critical to avoiding DRAM performance bottlenecks. Because requests going through the “Garlic” link can’t snoop caches, “Garlic” can’t guarantee it retrieves the latest data written by the CPU cores.That’s where the “Onion” link comes in. An OpenCL programmer can tell the runtime to allocate cacheable host memory, then hand it over for the GPU to use without an explicit copy. “Onion” requests pass through the XBAR and get switched to the MCT, which can issue probes to the CPU caches. That lets the GPU access the CPU’s cacheable memory space and retrieve up-to-date data. Unfortunately, “Onion” can’t saturate DRAM bandwidth and tops out at just under 10 GB/s. Trinity’s interconnect also doesn’t come with probe filters, so probe response counts exceed 45 million per second. Curiously, probe response counts are lower than if a probe had been issued for every 64B cacheline.Northbridge performance counters count “Onion” requests as IO to memory traffic at the XBAR. “Garlic” traffic is not counted at the XBAR, and is only observed at the DRAM controllers. Curiously, the iGPU also creates IO to memory traffic when accessing a very large buffer nominally allocated out of the GPU’s memory space (no ALLOC_HOST_PTR flag), implying it’s using the “Onion” link when it runs out of memory space backed by “Garlic”. If so, iGPU memory accesses over “Onion” incur roughly 320 ns of extra latency over a regular “Garlic” access.Therefore Trinity’s iGPU takes a significant bandwidth penalty when accessing CPU-side memory, even though both memory spaces are backed by the same physical medium. AMD’s later Infinity Fabric handles this in a more seamless manner, as CS-es observe all CPU and GPU memory accesses. Infinity Fabric CS-es have a probe filter, letting them maintain coherency without creating massive probe traffic.CPU to iGPU Memory AccessTelling the GPU to access cacheable CPU memory is one way to enable zero-copy behavior. The other way is to map GPU-side memory into a CPU program’s address space. Doing so lets Trinity’s iGPU use its high bandwidth “Garlic” link, and AMD allows this using a CL_MEM_USE_PERSISTENT_MEM_AMD flag. But because the Northbridge has no clue what the GPU is doing through its “Garlic” link, it can’t guarantee cache coherency. AMD solves this by making the address space uncacheable (technically write-combining) from the CPU side, with heavy performance consequences for the CPU.Besides not being able to enjoy higher bandwidth and lower latency from cache hits, the CPU can’t combine reads from the same cacheline into a single fill request. From the Northbridge perspective, the System Request Interface sends “sized reads” to the XBAR instead of regular “cache block” commands. From Llano’s documentation, the CPU to iGPU memory request path only supports a single pending read, and that seems to apply to Trinity too.Bandwidth sinks like a stone with the CPU unable to exploit memory level parallelism. Worse, the CPU to iGPU memory path appears less optimized in latency terms. Pointer chasing latency is approximately 93.11 ns across a small 8 KB array. For comparison, requests to cacheable memory space with 2 MB pages achieve lower than 70 ns of latency with a 1 GB array. I’m not sure what page size AMD’s drivers use when mapping iGPU memory into CPU address space, but usi",

        "description": "Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. The large cloud market piqued the interest of other CPU makers including Qualcomm. Qualcomm had grown to become a formidable force in the mobile SoC market by the mid-2010s, and had several in-house CPU designs under their belt. They had good reason to be confident about their cloud server prospects. High core counts in server chips translate to low per-core power, blunting AMD and Intel’s greatest strength of high single threaded performance.From a 2017 Qualcomm presentationMeanwhile, Qualcomm’s mobile background gave them plenty of experience in low power CPU design. Their high mobile volume gave them access to Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. That could at least level the playing field against Intel’s 14nm node, if not give Qualcomm an outright advantage in power consumption and density. Qualcomm hoped to use those factors to deliver a cheaper, lower power competitor on the cloud computing scene.To break into the cloud computing segment, Qualcomm needed a CPU architecture with enough performance to meet key metrics in areas like tail-end latency. During a Hot Chips presentation, Qualcomm noted that throwing a pile of weak cores onto a chip and calling it day wouldn’t cut it. An Arm cloud CPU may not have to match Intel and AMD core for core, but they do need to hit a baseline level of performance. Qualcomm hopes to do that while maintaining their traditional power and density advantages.Core OverviewThe Falkor CPU architecture aims to meet that performance threshold with low power and silicon area requirements. Falkor is a 4-wide aarch64 core with features inherited from Qualcomm’s prior mobile cores. It runs the 64-bit Arm instruction set (aarch64, armv8) with a few features pulled in from armv8.1. 32-bit Arm support is absent, as there’s no large existing install base of Arm server applications. Falkor is Qualcomm’s 5th in-house core design, and the company’s first designed specifically for cloud computing.A Centriq 2400 series chip packs up to 48 Falkor cores on a 398mm2 die with a 120W TDP. That translates to less than 2.5W per core. Qualcomm notes that power consumption is usually well under 120W in typical all-core loads.Qualcomm slide showing Centriq server SKUsFor this article, Neggles (Andi) was given a Centriq 2452 system from the folks at Corellium at no cost in order for us to test it. So a massive shout out to both Corellium for providing the system as well as to Neggles for getting the system up and running. The Centriq 2452 system is set up with 96 GB of DDR4 running at 2666 MT/s, and identifies itself as the “Qualcomm Centriq 2400 Reference Evaluation Platform CV90-LA115-P23”.FrontendFalkor has both a L0 and L1 instruction cache like Qualcomm’s prior Krait architecture, and possibly Kryo too. The 24 KB, 3-way set associative L0 delivers instructions at lower power and with lower latency. The L0 is sized to contain the large majority of instruction fetches, while the 64 KB 8-way L1 instruction cache handles larger code footprints. Although the L0 fills a similar role to micro-op caches and loop buffers in other CPUs, it holds ISA instruction bytes just like a conventional instruction cache.Both instruction cache levels have enough bandwidth to feed Falkor’s 4-wide decoder. The two instruction cache levels are exclusive of each other, so the core effectively has 88 KB of instruction cache capacity. Qualcomm might use a victim cache setup to maintain that exclusive relationship. If so, incoming probes would have to check both the L0 and L1, and L1 accesses would incur the additional cost of a copy-back from L0 on top of a fill into L0. An inclusive setup would let the L1 act as a snoop filter for the L0 and reduces the cost of L1 accesses, but has less total caching capacity.The exclusive L0/L1 setup gives Falkor high instruction caching capacity compared to contemporary cores. Falkor wouldn't be beaten in this respect until Apple's M1 launched several years later. High instruction cache capacity makes L2 code fetch bandwidth less important. Like many 64-bit Arm cores of the time, or indeed AMD's pre-Zen cores, Falkor's instruction throughput drops sharply once code spills into L2. Still, Faklor performs better than A72 in that respect.Falkor's instruction caches are parity protected, as is common for many CPUs. Hardware resolves parity errors by invalidating corrupted lines and reloading them from L2. The instruction caches also hold branch targets alongside instruction bytes, and therefore serve as branch target buffers (BTBs). A single cache access provides both instructions and branch targets, so Falkor doesn't have to make a separate BTB access like cores with a decoupled BTB do. However, that prevents the branch predictor from following the instruction stream past a L1i miss.Taken branches incur one pipeline bubble (2 cycle latency) within L0, and up to 6 cycle latency from L1. For smaller branch footprints, Falkor do zero-bubble taken branches using a 16 entry branch target instruction cache (BTIC). Unlike a BTB, the BTIC caches instructions at the branch destination rather than the target address. It therefore bypasses cache latency, and allows zero-bubble taken branches without needing to make a L0 achieve single cycle latency.Direction prediction uses multiple history tables, each using a different history length. The branch predictor tracks which history length and corresponding table works best for a given branch. The scheme described by Qualcomm is conceptually similar to a TAGE predictor, which also uses multiple history tables and tags tables to indicate whether they’re useful for a given branch. Falkor doesn’t necessarily use a classic TAGE predictor. For example, the history lengths may not be in a geometric series. But the idea of economizing history storage by using the most appropriate history length for each branch still stands. Arm’s Cortex A72 uses a 2-level predictor, presumably with a single table and a fixed history length.In an abstract test with varying numbers of branches, each being taken or not-taken in random patterns of increasing length, Falkor does slightly better than Kryo. Falkor handles better with a lot of branches in play, though the longest repeating pattern either core can handle is similar for a small number of branches.Falkor a two-level indirect target array for indirect branches, which read a target from a register rather than specifying a jump distance. An indirect branch may go to different targets, adding another dimension of difficulty to branch prediction. Falkor’s first level indirect target array has 16 entries, while a second level has 512 entries.Having multiple targets for an indirect branch carries little penalty as long as total target count doesn’t exceed 16. That can be one branch switching between 16 targets, or eight branches alternating between two targets each.Returns are a special case of indirect branches, because they typically go back to the call site. Falkor has a 16 entry return stack like Kryo. Cortex A72 has a much larger return stack with 31 entries. A function call and return costs approximately four cycles on Falkor, Kryo, and A72, which would be an average of 2 cycles per branch-with-link instruction.Falkor’s decoders translate up to four instructions per cycle into micro-ops. Like most other CPUs, Qualcomm aims to decode most common instructions into a single micro-op. 128-bit vector math instructions appear to be a notable exception.Rename/AllocateMicro-ops from the decoders need resources allocated in the backend for bookkeeping during out-of-order execution. Falkor’s renamer can handle register renaming and resource allocation for up to for micro-ops per cycle. However, the fourth slot can only process direct branches and a few specialized cases like NOPs or recognized register zeroing cases. A conditional branch that also includes an ALU operation, like cbz/cbnz, cannot go into the fourth slot.Slide from Qualcomm’s Hot Chips presentationBesides special handling for zeroing registers by moving an immediate value of zero into it, I didn’t see other common optimizations carried out.There’s no MOV elimination, and the renamer doesn’t recognize that XOR-ing or subtracting a register from itself results in zero.Out-of-Order ExecutionFalkor doesn’t have a classic reorder buffer, or ROB. Rather, it uses a series of structures that together enable out-of-order execution while ensuring program results are consistent with in-order execution. Falkor has a 256 entry rename/completion buffer. Qualcomm further states Falkor can have 128 uncommitted instructions in flight, along with another 70+ uncommitted instructions for a total of 190 in-flight instructions. The core can retire 4 instructions per cycle.From a microbenchmarking perspective, Falkor acts like Arm’s Cortex A73. It can free resources like registers and load/store queue entries past a long latency load, with no visible limit to reordering capacity even past 256 instructions. An unresolved branch similarly blocks out-of-order resource deallocation, after which Falkor’s reordering window can be measured. At that point, I may be measuring what Qualcomm considers uncommitted instructions.Kryo and Falkor have similar reordering capacity from that uncommitted instruction perspective. But otherwise Qualcomm has re-balanced the execution engine to favor consistent performance for non-vector code. Falkor has a few more register file entries than Kryo, and more crucially, far larger memory ordering queues.Integer execution pipelines on Falkor are specialized to handle different categories of operations from each other. Three pipes have integer ALUs, and a fourth pipe is dedicated to direct branches. Indirect branches use one o",

        "description": "Focus is currently on AMD-based PCs with hardware similar to the Steam Deck. Valve is releasing version 3.7 of SteamOS to the general public, and among the routine updates and changes is a big one: This is the SteamOS release that finally adds official support for some kinds of PC hardware other than Valve's own Steam Deck. Valve mentions certain specific handhelds as having either \"official\" or \"improved support,\" including the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and the Lenovo Legion Go S. It also includes directions for configuring the original Legion Go and ROG Ally for SteamOS installation. But Valve says that only the Steam Deck and Legion Go S have fully baked SteamOS support. The release claims to run on \"other AMD powered handhelds\" more broadly, implying that most third-party handheld PCs with Ryzen Z1 or Z2-series processors ought to support at least some basic functionality. Other all-AMD desktops and laptops have a decent shot at being supported, too.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "But new RDNA 4 GPU won't be coming until later this year; RTX 5060 is out now. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 were fairly well received when they were released in March, ably competing with Nvidia's RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti for the same or a little less money. We were impressed by the cards' performance and power efficiency, even if they still have some of the same caveats as older Radeon cards (lack of DLSS upscaling and lower relative ray-tracing performance being two). Today AMD is formally expanding its family of RDNA 4 graphics cards with the Radeon RX 9060 XT, a GPU that will go up against Nvidia's RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti GPUs. These GPUs have just half the compute units of the RX 9070 XT, but at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB configurations, they ought to be decent options for 1080p or entry-level 1440p gaming PCs (with the eternal \"if you can find them\" caveat that comes with buying a GPU in 2025). AMD says the new GPUs will be available \"beginning later this year\" from the typical range of partners—AMD released renders of a reference GPU design, but sometimes these are starting points that manufacturers can take or leave, rather than products AMD intends to manufacture and sell itself.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Shares of semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) rose 6% Wednesday on news the company is issuing a $6 billion stock buyback, which represents about 3.3% of the company’s current market value, according to data from Bloomberg. The $6 billion stock buyback authorization comes in addition to a $4 billion existing buyback, for a total of $10 billion in share repurchases, CNBC reported. The news comes after AMD announced a multi-year $10 billion AI partnership with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, focused on developing advanced AI infrastructure and technology, in order to diversify the nation’s economy beyond just oil. Nvidia announced a similar, but separate, multi-year deal. “At AMD, we have a bold vision to enable the future of AI everywhere – bringing open, high-performance computing to every developer, AI start-up and enterprise around the world,” AMD’s CEO Lisa Su told Fast Company in a statement. “Our investment with HUMAIN is a significant milestone in advancing global AI infrastructure. Together, we are building a globally significant AI platform that delivers performance, openness and reach at unp recedented levels.” The announcement comes in conjunction with President Trump’s visit this week to Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of the Gulf region. “This is not just another infrastructure play – it’s an open invitation to the world’s innovators,” Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in a statement. “We are democratizing AI at the compute level, ensuring that access to advanced AI is limited only by imagination, not by infrastructure.” Analysts at Bank of America noted it marks the first time AMD is on a “similar”footing as rival Nvidia in terms of “engagement in large projects” and reiterated buy rating for both companies, as reported by Investing.com.",

        "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.That enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.The company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.Thanks to the prescience of Nvidia's leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.AMDAMD, led by CEO Lisa Su, lags behind Nvidia but remains its most serious competitor.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty ImagesAMD is Nvidia's top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center. Helmed by its formidable CEO Lisa Su, AMD launched its own GPU, called the MI300, for the data center in 2024, more than a full year after Nvidia's second generation of data center GPUs started shipping.Though experts and analysts have touted the chip's specifications and potential based on its design and architecture, the company's software is still somewhat behind that of Nvidia, making these chips somewhat harder to program and use to their full potential.Analysts predict that the company has under 15% market share. But AMD executives insist that they are committed to bringing its software up to par and that future expectations for the evolution of the accelerated computing market will benefit the company — specifically, the spread of AI into so-called edge devices like phones and laptops.Qualcomm, Broadcom, and custom chipsAlso challenging Nvidia are application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. These custom-designed chips are less versatile than GPUs, but they can be designed for specific AI computing workloads at a much lower cost, which have made them a popular option for hyperscalers.Though multipurpose chips like Nvidia's and AMD's graphics processing units are likely to maintain the largest share of the AI-chip market in the long term, custom chips are growing fast. Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.Companies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.Marvell is in part responsible for Amazon's Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google's tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.Amazon and GoogleWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.Amazon's Trainium chips and Google's TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia chips, mostly for the companies' internal AI workloads. However, the companies have shown some progress in getting customers and partners to use their chips as well. Anthropic has committed to running some workloads on Amazon's chips, and Apple has done the same with Google's.IntelIntel and its Gaudi line of AI chips has struggled to compete with Nvidia and AMD.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesOnce the great American name in chip-making, Intel has fallen far behind its competitors in the age of AI. But, the firm does have a line of AI chips called Gaudi that some reports have said can stand up to Nvidia's in some respects.Intel installed a new CEO, semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan, in the first quarter of 2025 and one of his first actions was to flatten the organization so that the AI chip operations reports directly to him.HuaweiThough Nvidia's American hopeful challengers are many, China's Huawei is perhaps the most concerning competitor of all for Nvidia and all those concerned with continued US supremacy in AI.Huang himself has called Huawei the \"single most formidable\" tech company in China. Reports that Huawei's AI chip innovation is catching up are increasing in frequency. New restrictions from the Biden and Trump administrations on shipping even lower-power GPUs to China have further incentivized the company to catch up and serve the Chinese markets for AI. Analysts say further restrictions being considered by the Trump administration are now unlikely to hamper China's AI progress.StartupsAlso challenging Nvidia are a host of startups offering new chip designs and business models to the AI computing market.These firms are starting out at a disadvantage, as they don't have the full-sized sales and distribution machines decades of chip sales in other types of tech bring. But several are holding their own by finding use cases, customers, and distribution methods that are attractive to customers based on faster processing speeds or lower cost. These new AI players include Cerebras, Etched, Groq, Positron AI, Sambanova Systems, and Tenstorrent, among others.Read the original article on Business Insider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.Nvidia's dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.Nvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space.

Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.Companies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.Marvell is in part responsible for Amazon's Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google's tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.Amazon and GoogleWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.Amazon's Trainium chips and Google's TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alterna",

        "description": "Top executives from OpenAI, Microsoft, AMD and CoreWeave urged lawmakers at a U.S. Senate hearing Thursday (May 8) to support the nation’s artificial intelligence efforts through “light-touch” regulations. “The stakes could not be higher — and Congress is right that the United States must lead the way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said before the Senate […] The post Tech Leaders Urge Congress for ‘Light-Touch’ AI Regulations appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Top executives from OpenAI, Microsoft, AMD and CoreWeave urged lawmakers at a U.S. Senate hearing Thursday (May 8) to support the nation’s artificial intelligence efforts through “light-touch” regulations. “The stakes could not be higher — and Congress is right that the United States must lead the way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in Washington, D.C. The hearing, “Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation,” revealed the companies’ common priorities to accelerate infrastructure investment; build a skilled AI workforce, including high-skilled immigration; and speed up permitting for power plants. In a largely chummy hearing — at one point a senator informally called Altman “Sam” instead of “Mr. Altman” — lawmakers asked the executives what the government can do to stay ahead in AI and keep China at bay. Altman said a “light-touch regulatory framework,” initiatives to support AI infrastructure and supply chains, the easing of the permitting process and getting more energy online are things the tech sector needs. “We’ll need your help,” Altman told Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, who made a pitch for AI data center investments in his state. Microsoft President Brad Smith said clarifying rules around data used for training would be helpful. There have been several lawsuits over copyrighted material being used for AI training without compensation to the creators. Smith gave the example of Shakespeare’s literary works. People read Shakespeare and are inspired by the Bard to create their own content. Such content should be “fair use” for AI model training. Read also: AI Regulations in States Shift to Pro-Innovation, Not Risk Mitigation China Under the Microscope Throughout the hearing, a recurring concern among senators was China gaining on the U.S. in the AI race and the implications that would have on geopolitics. Altman said the future can be “almost unimaginably bright, but only if we take concrete steps to ensure that an American-led version of AI, built on democratic values like freedom and transparency, prevails over an authoritarian one.” Lisa Su, CEO of chipmaker AMD, warned that “leadership is not guaranteed.” For example, Su said chip export controls that affect AMD and its rivals may slow AI development in adversarial nations, but people will make do with what they have and still advance in AI. The President Joe Biden administration restricted advanced chip AI exports primarily to China to slow that nation’s AI development. The President Donald Trump administration is revisiting those rules, delaying implementation, Reuters reported. Microsoft’s Smith said exports must be regulated with the right controls because if allied countries cannot get American technology, they will get it elsewhere. The “No. 1 factor” in determining which country leads in AI is “whose technology is more broadly adopted by the rest of the world,” Smith said. Su agreed. “If our international partners cannot access U.S. platforms, they will adopt alternatives that may be less advanced today but will mature over time,” she said. Michael Intrator, CEO of cloud GPU provider CoreWeave, said poorly crafted restrictions could “inadvertently bolster foreign competitors.” He called for rules that foster international cooperation rather than fragmenting the global AI market. “AI represents the next major evolution of technology with the potential to transform society,” Intrator said. “This is America’s AI moment, and a strategic opportunity America cannot afford to miss.” See also: AI Regulations: OpenAI Calls on EU to Review, Simplify AI Rules Powering the AI Economy Each executive stressed that massive computing power is the bedrock of AI progress — and the U.S. must expand its data center capacity, power grid and chip supply. “AI computation is energy-intensive,” Intrator said, citing U.S. Department of Energy forecasts that data centers could consume up to 12% of the nation’s electricity by 2028. “Every month of delay represents lost ground in a field where the pace of innovation is measured in weeks, not years.” Smith said Microsoft is investing over $80 billion this year in AI infrastructure, with more than half going to U.S. projects. “Just as you can’t have reliable electricity in your home without a powerplant, you can’t have AI without data centers and AI infrastructure,” he said. All four executives said the talent gap could become a major chokepoint for U.S. competitiveness. Altman said OpenAI’s models are already helping students and educators in states like Texas and North Carolina, with one-third of college-aged users in the U.S. relying on ChatGPT for tutoring and learning. “AI will be vitally important to ensuring that today’s students are ready for tomorrow’s jobs,” he said. Smith called for a national goal to make AI literacy accessible to all Americans, especially through partnerships with K-12 schools, community colleges and trade programs. “Perhaps the single biggest challenge for data center expansion in the United States is a national shortage of people,” Smith said. “Over the next decade, the U.S. will need to recruit and train half a million new electricians to meet the country’s growing electricity needs.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "AMD plans to capitalize on AI inference workloads moving to edge devices, CTO Mark Papermaster tells BI. Mark Papermaster is CTO of AMD.2025 ARPA-E Energy Innovation SummitAMD sees the AI inference shift as a chance to grab market share from Nvidia.AI inference will move from data centers to edge devices, like smartphones, AMD's CTO says.Mark Papermaster expects an AI 'killer app' in the next three to six years.The lion's share of artificial intelligence workloads moving from training to inference is great news for AMD, its CTO said.AI training workloads — the ones that make up the gargantuan task of building large language models, imbuing them with a familiar writing or speaking style, and knowledge — used to be most of what AI computing was used for. Inference is the computing process that happens when AI generates outputs like answering questions or creating images.It's hard to pin down exactly when the switch happened — probably some time last year. But inference is now and will likely stay the largest segment of accelerated computing going forward. Since then, AMD executives have been hyping up a window of opportunity to wrest market share from Nvidia.\"People like the work that we've done in inference,\" CEO Lisa Su said on the company's February earnings call.AI at scale is all about inference.If you ask Mark Papermaster, AMD's Chief Technology Officer, where it all goes from there, he'll tell you that as inference grows, it's headed for the edge.\"Edge devices\" are the industry term for computers that live outside the data center. Our phones and laptops all qualify, but so could smart traffic lights or sensors in factories. Papermaster's job is to make sure AMD is headed in the right direction to meet the demand for AI computing across devices as it grows.AMD has had to play catch-up in the data center since Nvidia's 10-year head start. But at the edge? The field is more open.Business Insider asked Papermaster what he thinks the future of handheld AI looks like.This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.What's the most prominent use for AI computing in edge devices like laptops and phones?The use case you're starting to see is local, immediate, low-latency content creation.Why do we use PCs? We use them to communicate, and we use them to create content. As you and I are talking — this is a Microsoft Teams event — AI is running underneath this. I could have a correction on it such that if I look side to side, you just see me centered. That's an option. I can hit automatic translation — you could be in Saudi Arabia and not speak any English, and we could have simultaneous translation once these things become truly embedded and operational, which is imminent.It's truly amazing what's coming because just locally on your PC, you'll be able to verbally describe: 'Hey, I'm building a PowerPoint. I need this. I need these features. I'm running Adobe. This is what I want.'Today, I've got to go back to the cloud. I've got to run the big, heavy compute. It's more expensive and it takes more time.That's the immediate example that's front and center, and this is why we've invested heavily in AI PCs. That's imminent from Microsoft and others in the next six months.The other application that we're already seeing is autonomous anything. It starts with cars, but it's way beyond cars. It's the autonomous factory floor.OK, say it's 2030 — how much inference is done at the edge?Over time, it'll be a majority. I can't say when the switch over is because it's driven by the applications — the development of the killer apps that can run on edge devices. We're just seeing the tip of the spear now, but I think this moves rapidly.You might consider phones as an analogy. Those phones were just a nice assist until the App Store came out and made it really easy to create a ton of applications on your phone.Now, things that used to always be done with more performant computing could be done more locally. Things that were done in the cloud could be done locally. As we start to get killer applications, we're going to start to see that shift go very rapidly. So it's in the next three to six years, no doubt.I keep running into examples that suggest the way models are getting better is to just keep piling on more inference compute.How do you know that three years from now, there's not going to be some breakthrough that makes all these devices being designed now completely out of date?Everything you're describing is to gain even more capability and accuracy. It doesn't mean that what we have is not useful. It's just going to be constantly improving, and the improvement goes into two vectors.One vector is becoming more accurate. It can do more things, and typically drives more compute. There's an equal vector that runs in parallel, saying, 'How could I be more optimized?'I call it the DeepSeek moment. It sort of shook the world. Now you have everybody — Microsoft, Meta, Google — making their models more efficient. So you have both examples where it's taking more and more compute and examples where there's innovation driving more and more efficiency. That's not going to change.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The post Chip Industry Week In Review appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. TSMC said it will produce 30% of its leading-edge chips in Arizona when all six of its fabs are operational, a total investment of $165 billion, Axios reported. In its latest SEC filing, the foundry said it continues to add capacity in Taiwan, Arizona, Japan, and Germany. The Trump administration launched a Section 232 investigation into semiconductors and related equipment to determine if tariffs or other measures are needed to protect national security. The administration also clarified late last week that, at least for now, smartphones, computers and other devices are excluded from reciprocal tariffs. The latest U.S. export license requirements now include Nvidia’s H20 products and AMD‘s MI308 products, leading both companies to issue SEC filings with Nvidia forecasting $5.5 billion in charges and AMD projecting up to $800 million in related costs. CSIS weighed in on semiconductor export restrictions’ chances of success in its recent commentary, The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China Challenge. China’s recent export restrictions on seven rare earth elements and magnets has a significant impact to national security, according to CSIS. Those elements are used in defense technologies, radar, EVs, wireless technology, and more. China currently has an effective monopoly over the supply. Latest financial updates: TSMC posted +US$25 billion in Q1 revenue, up ~35% (in USD) compared with last year. The company maintained an upbeat 2025 full-year forecast despite the trade war, and refuted rumors about a joint venture with Intel. ASML issued its Q1 earnings announcement this week, which was in line with guidance, but CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that “the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while.” Find the latest chip industry stock results here. AMD taped out its Venice processor, manufactured using TSMC’s 2nm (N2) process technology. Nvidia is designing and plans to build up to $500 billion of U.S. AI supercomputing factories over the next four years through partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor and SPIL. Deals: Cadence will acquire Arm’s Artisan foundation IP business, consisting of standard cell libraries, memory compilers, and general-purpose I/Os optimized for advanced process nodes. The deal, which brings foundation IP into Cadence’s broader IP portfolio, is expected to close in Q3 2025. Intel will sell 51% of Altera to investment firm Silver Lake in a deal that values the FPGA maker at $8.75 billion. Intel will retain the remaining 49% stake. Intel acquired Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion. Raghib Hussain, previously president of products and technologies at Marvell, will take over as Altera’s new CEO. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025. JEDEC published the latest high-bandwidth memory (HBM) standard. HBM4 increases transfer speeds up to 8 Gb/s across a 2,048-bit interface, boosting total bandwidth up to 2 TB/s. It also doubles the number of independent channels per stack to provide access flexibility. Cadence, meanwhile, announced HBM4 12.8Gbps memory IP, compatible with the new JEDEC spec, with 20% greater power efficiency per bit, 50% better area efficiency, and twice as many I/Os.

        "description": "Shares in Nvidia Corporation and other chip technology companies are down in premarket trading this morning after Nvidia confirmed that it would take a significant financial hit to cover costs associated with a newly required export license so it can ship some of its latest chips outside of the United States. Here’s what you need to know about the new requirement and its effect on tech stocks. What’s happened? Yesterday, AI chipmaking giant Nvidia revealed that it will record a $5.5 billion charge this year related to its H20 chips, sending the stock down in premarket trading this morning. Nvidia made the revelation about a week after the Trump administration added new export license requirements to the H20. Nvidia initially revealed that information in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated April 9. In that filing, Nvidia revealed that the U.S. government now requires Nvidia to obtain an export license to export its H20 chips to China and select other countries. Due to this, Nvidia expects to incur about $5.5 billion in costs related to “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” of the H20. The H20 chip is a chip Nvidia designed especially for the Chinese marketplace in order to comply with U.S. export restrictions, notes CNBC. In 2024, Nvidia made between $12 billion and $15 billion selling the H20. But now the associated $5.5 billion charge will take a significant chunk out of those revenues. The Trump administration’s new export controls are also a sign that Nvidia could face an increasingly challenging environment when exporting its chips to countries that the U.S. believes could use them in ways that could disadvantage America. In Nvidia’s 8-K filing, the company said that the new export license requirement covers “the Company’s H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof” and that the United States government “indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” But China (including Hong Kong and Macau), isn’t the only country that the new export license requirement applies to. The license is also required for other so-called “D:5 countries.” According to a March 2024 publication by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, D:5 countries comprise over two dozen nations, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iran, Libya, Nicaragua, Russia, and Venezuela. On April 14, the United States government said the license requirement would “be in effect for the indefinite future,” according to Nvidia’s filing. Chip stocks fall The expected $5.5 billion charge related to Nvidia’s H20 chips has sent the stock tumbling nearly 6% in premarket trading this morning as of the time of this writing. Nvidia shares (Nasdaq: NVDA) are currently down around $6.45 to $105.75. However, it’s not just Nvidia shares that are down. The stock prices of chipmakers often move in unison—suggesting that most investors believe that what is good or bad for one company could be good or bad for the chip industry as a whole. The new export license requirement on Nvidia is a sign to many that U.S. chipmakers may see rougher waters ahead when it comes to exporting their products across the globe. Rougher export waters could lead to higher costs, reduced profits, or both. Other chipmakers this morning are currently seeing their stock price down, too, including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): down 3% Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC): down 2.7% Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO): down 4% Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU): down 3.8% Arm Holdings plc (Nasdaq: ARM): down 4.8% QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM): down 2.2% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD): down 7% ASML warns about weaker orders However, the Nvidia news may not be the only thing dragging down these other chip companies. Currently, shares in the Dutch company ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML) are also down 4.7% in premarket trading as of the time of this writing. ASML isn’t a chip maker itself. It manufactures the critical machines that chipmakers need to produce their chips. As noted by the Wall Street Journal, ASML has now reported that orders for its machines that help make semiconductors totaled $4.45 billion in its first quarter. That was well below the $5.5 billion that analysts were expecting, suggesting a massive slowdown in once-expected production by chipmakers. ASML warned that President Trump’s policies were creating uncertainty for the semiconductor industry. Not including today’s premarket falls, companies operating in the semiconductor space have had a rough 2025 so far—not helped by Trump’s recent tariff policies and now, tightening export rules. As of market close yesterday, since the beginning of the year, NVDA shares were down 16.4%, TSM shares were down 21.4%, AVGO shares were down 22.8%, MU shares were down 15.5%, AMD shares were down 21.1%, and ARM shares were down 17.5%. Before today’s premarket drop, ASML shares were down 1.8% for the year.",

        "description": "Raytraced effects have gained increasing adoption in AAA titles, adding an extra graphics quality tier beyond traditional “ultra” settings. Raytraced effects have gained increasing adoption in AAA titles, adding an extra graphics quality tier beyond traditional “ultra” settings. AMD has continuously advanced their raytracing implementation in response. Often, this involved fitting the GPU’s general architecture to the characteristics of raytracing workloads. On RDNA 4, examples include “out-of-order” memory access and dynamic register allocation. Both are targeted at raytracing, but other applications can benefit too, though perhaps not to the same degree.RX 9070 Hellhound, with focus on the minimal LED lightingCompared to RDNA 3, RDNA 4’s RT IP 3.1 gets doubled intersection testing, oriented bounding boxes, primitive compression, and other goodies. Fixed function hardware is tightly tied to predefined data structures, and AMD has unsurprisingly updated those data structures to utilize those updated features.Doubled Intersection Engines, Wider BVHRDNA 4’s doubled intersection test throughput internally comes from putting two Intersection Engines in each Ray Accelerator. RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 Ray Accelerators presumably had a single Intersection Engine, capable of four box tests or one triangle test per cycle. RDNA 4’s two intersection engines together can do eight box tests or two triangle tests per cycle. A wider BVH is critical to utilizing that extra throughput.Raytracing uses a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) that recursively subdivides scene geometry. Each node represents a 3D box-shaped space, and links to sub-boxes. Intersection tests determine which link (child) to follow, until traversal reaches the bottom of the tree where the node contains triangle data instead of links to sub-boxes. Each traversal step therefore scopes down the intersection search to a smaller box. More intersection test throughput can speed up this traversal process.But speeding up traversal isn’t as simple as doubling up intersection test throughput. Each traversal step is a pointer chasing operation, which incurs memory latency. GPUs have high cache and DRAM latency compared to a CPU, but excel at parallel compute. RDNA 4 moves to 8-wide box nodes, up from 4-wide ones in RDNA 2 and 3. A wider box node presents more parallel work at each step. More importantly, it allows a “fatter” tree that requires fewer traversal steps to reach the bottom. Thus the 8-wide BVH shifts emphasis from latency to throughput, avoiding a key GPU weakness.Since RDNA 2, AMD has used a conservative raytracing strategy where a shader program controls the raytracing process from ray generation to result shading. During BVH traversal, a raytracing shader accesses RDNA 4’s Ray Accelerator with a new IMAGE_BVH8_INTERSECT_RAY instruction. This instruction takes a ray and a pointer to a 8-wide BVH node, and uses both Intersection Engines together. Output from both Intersection Engines head to a sorting unit, which can either sort the two 4-wide halves separately or sort across all eight results with a “wide sort” option. To speed up traversal, AMD had hardware traversal stack management in the LDS since RDNA 3. LDS stack management gets updated in RDNA 4 with a new DS_BVH_STACK_PUSH8_POP1_RTN_B32 instruction1.An 8-wide BVH isn’t the only way to use RDNA 4’s doubled intersection test throughput. RDNA 4 adds an IMAGE_BVH_DUAL_INTERSECT_RAY instruction, which takes a pair of 4-wide nodes and also uses both Intersection Engines. Like the BVH8 instruction, IMAGE_BVH_DUAL_INTERSECT_RAY produces two pairs of 4 intersection test results and can intermix the eight results with a “wide sort” option. The traversal side likewise gets a DS_BVH_STACK_PUSH8_POP2_RTN_B64 instruction. AMD doesn’t describe the “BVH4x2” traversal algorithm, but it’s not hard to imagine what is considering what the two instructions above do. A ray can intersect multiple bounding boxes, creating multiple traversal paths. BVH4x2 almost certainly takes two of those paths in parallel, with two paths popped from the LDS and tested in the Ray Accelerator with each traversal step.So far I’ve only seen AMD generate 8-wide BVH-es for RDNA 4. That includes DirectX 12’s procedural geometry example, 3DMark tests, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, GTA V Enhanced Edition, and Quake 2 RTX. BVH4x2 traversal is less efficient than using a 8-wide BVH, because it requires more memory accesses and generates more LDS traffic. Furthermore, BVH4x2 relies in having at least two valid traversal paths to fully feed the Ray Accelerator, and how often that’s true may vary wildly depending on the ray in question. I’m not sure why AMD added a way to utilize both Intersection Engines with a 4-wide BVH.Oriented Bounding BoxesBVH-es traditionally use axis aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), meaning a box’s boundaries are aligned with the 3D world’s x, y, and z axes. Axis aligned boxes simplify intersection tests. However, game geometry is often not axis aligned. In those cases, an axis aligned box may end up much larger than the geometry it’s trying to contain, creating a lot of empty space. Rays that intersect the empty space end up taking useless traversal steps into the box before further intersection tests realize the path was useless.Chains hanging from Elden Ring’s Debate Parlor ceiling (RDNA 4 on the left and RDNA 2 on the right). RDNA 4 OBBs fit geometry better than axis-aligned boxes on RDNA 2. Screenshots are from Radeon Raytracing Analyzer with matched traversal countsRDNA 4 addresses this with Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs), where the bounding box is rotated to better approximate geometry within it. Storing a 3×3 3D rotation matrix for each box would dramatically increase memory usage. RDNA 4 therefore strikes a compromise. Each box node only specifies one OBB rotation for all of its children. For further storage savings, the OBB matrix is not stored in the node at all. Instead, the node stores an OBB matrix index, which is looked up in a table of 104 predefined matrices. In code, the matrix is stored as 9 packed 6-bit indices, which refer to entries in a second level lookup table with 26 unique FP32 values3.AMD’s OBB strategy therefore takes a best-effort approach to reduce useless box intersections with minimal storage cost. It’s not trying to generate perfectly optimal bounding box rotations every time. Thanks to this strategy, 8-wide box nodes remain reasonably sized at 128 bytes, and continue to match RDNA’s cacheline length. While the lookup table specified in code doesn’t necessarily show the exact hardware implementation, a simplistic calculation indicates the lookup table would use about 800 bytes of storage. That would make it small enough to fit in a small ROM within the Ray Accelerator.In Elden Ring, Y is the up axis, not ZCompromises of course leave room for improvement. Chains hanging from the ceiling in Elden Ring’s Debate Parlor present an optimal case for RDNA 4’s OBBs, because one rotation can fit well across all of the chains on each side. The chandeliers are another story, with four support chains each have different rotations. AMD selects an OBB that matches chain rotation in the Y (up) axis, but not X/Z. As a result the OBBs for each chain leave significant empty space that could result in false intersections. It’s still better than RDNA 2’s aligned bounding boxes, but there’s clearly room for improvement as well.Using one OBB rotation across the box is likely a necessary compromise. A simple way to handle OBB intersection testing is to rotate the incoming ray so that the box and ray become axis aligned (just with a different set of axes). RDNA 4 adds a ray transform block to the Ray Accelerator. AMD doesn’t explicitly say the transform block helps with OBBs. Instead, it’s used for transitions between top and bottom level acceleration structures (TLAS/BLAS). DirectX raytracing splits the BVH into two levels because a BLAS can be reused many times with different positions and rotations. That’s convenient for handling several copies of the same object, like the same chair type placed several times around a room.…the addition of a dedicated ray transform block, and this is used to offload the transformation that occurs as you transition from the top level of the ray acceleration structure into the bottom level…AMD Radeon Press Briefing VideoA TLAS to BLAS transition would involve rotating the ray to allow axis-aligned intersection tests within the BLAS, a similar operation to rotating a ray for OBB tests. A key difference is that traversal steps involving OBBs may happen more often than TLAS to BLAS transitions. AMD’s Ray Accelerator aims to handle a box node every cycle. Transforming a ray would involve multiplying both the origin and direction vector by a 3×3 rotation matrix, which naively requires 36 FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) per transform. At 2.5 GHz that would be 5.04 ray transformation TFLOP/s across the RX 9070’s ray accelerators. Providing different ray rotations for all eight boxes in a box node would multiply that figure by eight.AMD could also implement OBB-related ray transforms within the Intersection Engines. RDNA 4 can use OBBs with RDNA 2/3 legacy 4-wide box nodes, slipping the OBB matrix ID into into previously unused padding bits near the end of the 128B structure. BVH4x2 traversal may run into two nodes that specify different OBB rotations. That would require applying two ray transformations to fully feed both Intersection Engines. Even in that case, two ray transforms are far less expensive than eight, so AMD’s compromise makes sense.Primitive Node CompressionMinimizing BVH footprint is critical. A smaller BVH reduces VRAM consumption, cuts bandwidth requirements, and makes more economical use of cache capacity. RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 took a basic step with compressed triangle pairs, where",

        "description": "Modern GPUs often make a difficult tradeoff between occupancy (active thread count) and register count available to each thread. Modern GPUs often make a difficult tradeoff between occupancy (active thread count) and register count available to each thread. Higher occupancy provides more thread level parallelism to hide latency with, just as more SMT threads help hide latency on a CPU. But while a CPU can use all of its SMT threads regardless of what code it's running, the same doesn't apply to GPUs. GPU ISAs offer a large number of very wide vector registers. Storing all registers for all thread slots would be impractical because register files must balance capacity with speed and die area usage.For example, RDNA 4's ISA lets instructions address up to 256 vector general purpose registers (VGPRs). Each register is 1024 bits wide in wave32 mode, and each RDNA 4 SIMD has 16 thread slots. The SIMD would need a 512 KB register file to hold 256 registers for all 16 threads. In practice register requirements vary across different GPU workloads. RDNA 4, like many other GPUs, uses a smaller register file and allocates depending on what threads require. Code that needs a lot of registers can do so at the cost of less thread-level parallelism, while code that uses fewer registers can run more active threads and be less sensitive to latency. RDNA 4 desktop GPUs have a 192 KB register file per SIMD, so a GPU kernel can use all thread slots (achieve maximum occupancy) if it uses 96 or fewer vector registers.A bigger register file obviously improves the occupancy and register usage tradeoff situation. RDNA increased SIMD register file capacity to 128 KB, up from 64 KB on GCN. RDNA 3 introduced a 192 KB register file configuration for high end GPUs, where die area is likely less of a concern. But that strategy isn’t efficient for raytracing.AMD notes that ray traversal and hit/miss handling have different VGPR requirements. AMD uses an inline raytracing model where all raytracing stages run within the same thread. A raytracing shader’s VGPR allocation has to be set to the maximum that any stage requires, because a thread’s register allocation remains static throughout its lifetime. Even if code that needs a lot of registers only accounts for a small part of execution time, that high VGPR allocation will limit active thread count for the duration of the workload. Raytracing is particularly latency sensitive, and AMD would like to run as many threads (rays) in parallel as possible to help absorb latency.Dynamic Register AllocationTherefore RDNA 4 introduces a new dynamic VGPR allocation mode. In this mode, a thread starts with a minimum VGPR allocation and changes it throughout it’s lifetime. Rather than specify how many VGPRs a shader will use, the driver tells GPU to launch it in dynamic VGPR mode. A chip-wide SQ_DYN_VGPR register directly sets active thread count per SIMD, or occupancy, rather than having that inferred from shader VGPR usage. SQ_DYN_VGPR also controls other dynamic VGPR mode parameters, like VGPR allocation block size and deadlock avoidance mode.As defined in Linux kernel code. I couldn’t find references/usages in either Linux or LLVM, so I’m guessing what each field doesEach enabled thread slot gets a single reserved VGPR block, and a newly launched thread starts with just that VGPR block active. When the thread needs more registers, it requests a new VGPR count using a s_alloc_vgpr instruction. s_alloc_vgpr attempts to allocate more registers if called with a value higher than the current allocation, or frees registers if called with a lower value. Changing VGPR allocation affects the upper end of the usable VGPR range, just like with non-dynamic VGPR allocation. Hardware hands out VGPRs in blocks of 16 or 32, depending on how the driver sets up SQ_DYN_VGPR. A thread can allocate up to eight blocks, so the driver must select the larger block size and give up some allocation granularity if a thread needs to use more than 128 VGPRs.Allocation requests don’t always succeed. s_alloc_vgpr sets the Scalar Condition Code (SCC) to indicate success, or clears it on failure. SCC is analogous to a flag register on CPUs, and is used for branching and add-with-carry. Shader code has to check SCC to determine if an allocation request succeeded. If an allocation request fails, a shader could in theory try to find other useful work to do while periodically retrying the allocation. But doing so would be quite complex, so in practice a shader will busy-wait until allocation succeeds.Example of dynamic register allocation used in the DirectX procedural geometry exampleTherefore dynamic VGPR mode turns the occupancy question on its head. A SIMD can have as many active threads as the driver feels like, regardless of register allocation. But theoretical occupancy doesn’t tell the whole story. Threads can still get blocked waiting on VGPR allocation. A SIMD could have all thread slots filled, but some of those threads could be busy-waiting on VGPR allocation rather than making useful progress.Deadlock AvoidanceBusy-waiting can become more than a performance inconvenience. Dynamic VGPR allocation can lead to deadlock. AMD knows this, and describes how that can happen in RDNA 4’s ISA manual.I think a deadlock case can be more general than what AMD describes. If every thread in a SIMD needs to allocate more registers, but hardware doesn’t have enough free registers to satisfy any request, every thread will get stuck forever. That’s a deadlock, even if there are technically registers available.AMD mitigates some deadlock scenarios with a deadlock avoidance mode. The ISA manual is light on details, only saying it reserves just enough VGPRs for one thread to reach maximum VGPR allocation at all times. Each thread can allocate up to eight VGPR blocks, and one block comes reserved with the thread slot, so deadlock avoidance mode would reserve 7 VGPR blocks. I believe deadlock avoidance mode works by only allowing one thread to allocate registers from the reserved pool at a time. In short:Base case: No reserved registers allocated. Any request can proceedFrom (1), any combination of allocation requests from all threads will allow at least one thread (say thread A) to succeedFrom (2), no other thread can allocate from the reserved pool, allowing thread A to increase its register allocation to the maximum should it need to.Eventually A will leave its high register usage code section, or terminate completely, and thus free up registers for other threads to do the same.Needless to say, that situation isn’t great for performance because it can serialize useful work across threads. But getting to the finish line slowly is better than not getting there at all.Deadlock avoidance mode isn’t foolproof. If the programmer manages to meet three conditions:Two threads need to allocate registersThe high register usage sections of both threads depend on each other, for example in a producer consumer modelNo other thread can give up their registers until the two threads above make progressThen they can run into a deadlock even with deadlock avoidance mode enabled. Programmers should probably avoid cross-thread dependencies in dynamic VGPR mode, unless they’re confident threads only wait on each other in low VGPR usage sections.Dynamic VGPR Mode LimitationsAs with many new features, dynamic VGPR mode isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s narrowly targeted to start, and can only be used with wave32 compute shaders. Graphics shaders like pixel and vertex shaders can only use the regular non-dynamic launch mode. The same goes for wave64 shaders of any type.A workgroup of threads launched in dynamic VGPR mode will “take over” the equivalent of a GPU core. That would be a Workgroup Processor (WGP) in WGP mode, or a Compute Unit (CU) in CU mode. Thus dynamic and non-dynamic threads can’t coexist on the same GPU core.Registers used to specify various compute program launch parametersDynamic VGPR mode may be less efficient at using register file capacity. Each enabled thread slot gets a reserved VGPR block, regardless of whether a thread is actually running in that slot. A workload that doesn’t have enough parallelism to fill all enabled thread slots would waste those reserved registers. Deadlock avoidance mode would set aside more registers that could have been easily allocated in non-dynamic mode. Drivers can reduce reserved register count by disabling deadlock avoidance mode or reducing thread slot count. Both of those options come with obvious downsides. In wave32 mode, non-dynamic register mode can allocate up to 256 registers in 24 entry blocksa on current RDNA 4 GPUs. That offers finer granularity than the 32 entry blocks needed to give a thread 256 registers in dynamic VGPR mode.Nvidia’s Dynamic Register AllocationAMD isn’t the only GPU maker that lets a thread adjust register allocation mid-execution. Nvidia introduced a setmaxnreg PTX instruction in Hopper, and that’s carried forward to Blackwell consumer GPUs. setmaxnreg superficially acts like AMD’s s_alloc_vgpr, letting the calling thread request a different register allocation. However Nvidia’s dynamic register allocation works very differently from AMD’s, and is probably better called register reassignment. Nvidia for their part never gave this mechanism a name.Nvidia doesn’t use a separate launch mode. Kernels always launch the regular way, with a specified register allocation that also determines how many threads they can run concurrently. For example a compute shader that uses 96 registers on Blackwell will only be able to run 5 concurrent threads in each SM sub-partition. After threads launch, they can call setmaxnreg to shift registers between threads in the same workgroup. Unlike s_alloc_vgpr, setmaxnreg‘s register pool is whatever the workgroup started out with. If every thread calls setmaxnreg and requested register count across",

        "description": "Examining RDNA 4's out-of-order memory accesses in detail, and investigating with testing AMD's RDNA 4 brings a variety of memory subsystem enhancements. Among those, one slide stood out because it dealt with out-of-order memory accesses. According to the slide, RDNA 4 allows requests from different shaders to be satisfied out-of-order, and adds new out-of-order queues for memory requests.Cross-Wave Out-of-Order Memory AccessesAMD apparently had a false dependency case in the memory subsystem prior to RDNA 4. One wave could wait for a memory loads made by another wave. A \"wavefront\", \"wave\", or \"warp\" on a GPU is the rough equivalent of a CPU thread. It has its own register state, and can run out of sync with other waves. Each wave's instructions are independent from those in other waves with very few exceptions (like atomic operations).In RDNA 3, there was a strict ordering on the return of data, such that effectively a request that was made later in time was not permitted to pass a request made earlier in time, even if the data for it was ready much sooner.Navi 4 Architecture Deep Dive, Andrew Pomianowski, CVP, Silicon Design Engineering (AMD)A fundamental tenet of multithreaded programming is that you get no ordering guarantees between threads unless you make it happen via locks or other mechanisms. That's what makes multithreaded performance scaling work. AMD's slide took me by surprise because there's no reason memory reads should be an exception. I re-watched the video several times and stared at the slide for a while to see if that's really what they meant. They clearly meant it, but I still didn't believe my eyes and ears. So I took time to craft a test for it.Testing ItAMD's slide describes a scenario where one wave's cache misses prevent another wave from quickly consuming data from cache hits. Causing cache misses is easy. I can pointer chase through a large array with a random pattern (\"wave Y\"). Similarly, I can keep accesses within a small memory footprint to get cache hits (\"wave X\"). But doing both at the same time is problematic. Wave Y may evict data used by wave X, causing cache misses on wave X.Focusing on this scenario, and trying to create a Wave X and Wave Y that might hold each other upInstead of going for cache hits and misses, I tested by seeing whether waiting on memory accesses in one wave would falsely wait in on memory accesses made by another. My \"wave Y\" is basically a memory latency test, and makes a fixed number of accesses. Each access depends on the previous one's result, and I have the wave pointer chase through a 1 GB array to ensure cache misses. My \"wave X\" makes four independent memory accesses per loop iteration. It then consumes the load data, which means waiting for data to arrive from memory.Once wave Y completes all of its accesses, it sets a flag in local memory. Wave X makes as many memory accesses as it can until it sees the flag set, after which it writes out its “score” and terminates. I run both waves in the same workgroup to ensure they share a WGP, and therefore share as much of the memory subsystem as possible. Keeping both waves in the same workgroup also lets me place the “finished” flag in local memory. Wave X has to check that flag every iteration, and it’s best to have flag checks not go through the same caches that wave Y is busy contaminating.If each wave X access gets delayed by a wave Y one, I should see approximately the same number of accesses from both. Instead on RDNA 3, I see wave X make more accesses than wave Y by exactly the loop unroll factor on wave X. AMD's compiler statically schedules instructions and sends out all four accesses before waiting on data. It then waits on load completion with s_waitcnt vmcnt(...) instructions.Annotated RDNA 3 assembly generated by AMD's compiler for wave X. Note that unrolling the loop to use four memory accesses per iteration lets the compiler issue those four accesses before waiting on themAccesses tracked by vmcnt always return in-order, letting the compiler wait on specific accesses by waiting until vmcnt decrements to a certain value or lower. In wave Y, I make all accesses dependent so the compiler only waits for vmcnt to reach 0.Annotated RDNA 3 assembly for wave y, for completenessOn RDNA 3, s_waitcnt vmcnt(...) seems to wait for requests to complete not only from its wave, but from other waves too. That explains why wave X makes exactly four accesses for each access that wave Y makes. If I unroll the loop more, letting the compiler schedule more independent accesses before waiting, the ratio goes up to match the unroll factor.On RDNA 4, the two waves don’t care what the other is doing. That’s the way it should be. RDNA 4 also displays more run-to-run variation, which is also expected because cache behavior is highly unpredictable in this test. I’m surprised by the results, but it’s convincing evidence that AMD indeed had false cross-wave memory delays on RDNA 3 and older GPU architectures. I also tested on Renoir’s Vega iGPU, and saw the same behavior as RDNA 3.At a simplistic level, you can imagine that requests from the shaders go into a queue to be serviced, and many of those requests can be in flightNavi 4 Architecture Deep Dive, Andrew Pomianowski, CVP, Silicon Design Engineering (AMD)AMD's presentation hints that RDNA 3 and older GPUs had multiple waves sharing a memory access queue. As mentioned above, AMD GPUs since GCN handle memory dependencies with hardware counters that software waits on. By keeping vmcnt returns in-order, the compiler can wait on the specific load that produces data needed by the next instruction, without also waiting on every other load the wave has pending. RDNA 3 and prior AMD GPUs possibly had a shared memory access queue, with each entry tagged with its wave's ID. As each memory access leaves the queue in-order, hardware decrements the counter for its wave.Perhaps RDNA 4 divides the shared queue into per-thread queues. That would align with the point on AMD's slide saying RDNA 4 introduces \"additional out-of-order queues\" for memory requests. Or perhaps RDNA 4 retains a shared queue, but can drain entries out-of-order. That would require tracking extra info, like whether a memory access is the oldest one for its wave.Does it Happen to Others?Sharing a memory access queue and returning data in-order seems like a natural hardware simplification. That raises the question of whether GPU architectures from Intel and Nvidia had similar limitations.Intel's Xe-LPG does not have false cross-wave memory dependencies. Running the same test on Meteor Lake's iGPU shows variation depending on where the two waves end up. If wave X and wave Y run on XVEs with shared instruction control logic, wave X's performance is lower than in other cases. Regardless, it's clear Xe-LPG doesn't force a wave to wait on another's accesses. Intel's subsequent Battlemage (Xe2) architecture shows similar behavior, and the same applies to Intel's Gen 9 (Skylake) graphics from a while ago.I also checked generated assembly to ensure Intel's compiler wasn't unrolling the loop further.Generated assembly on Meteor Lake's iGPU for Wave X. UGM = untyped global memory, SLM = shared local memory. The rest is trivial, just remember that Intel GPUs have registers that are full of registers...never mindNvidia's Pascal has varying behavior depending on where waves are located within a SM. Each Pascal SM has four partitions, which are arranged in pairs that share a texture unit and a 24 KB texture cache. Waves are assigned to partitions within a pair first. It's as if the partitions are numbered [0,1]-> tex, [2,3]-> tex. Waves in the same sub-partition pair have the false dependency issue. Evidently they share some general load/store logic besides the texture unit, because I don't touch textures in this test.If a wave is not offset from another one by a multiple of four or multiple of 4 plus one, it doesn't have the false dependency problem. Turing, as tested on the GTX 1660 Ti, doesn't have a problem either.Better Nonblocking LoadsBesides removing false cross-wave delays, AMD also improved memory request handling within a wave. Much like in-order CPU cores, like Arm's Cortex A510, GPUs can execute independent instructions while waiting on memory access. A thread only stalls when it tries to use the memory access's result. GPUs have done this for decades, though the implementation details differ. Intel and Nvidia's GPUs use a software managed scoreboard. AMD used pending request counters from GCN onward.RDNA 4 uses the same scheme but splits out the vmcnt category into several counters. A thread can interleave global memory, texture sampling, and raytracing intersection test requests, and wait on them separately. That gives the compiler more flexibility to move work ahead of a wait for memory access completion. Another interpretation of AMD's slide is that the each counter corresponds to a separate queue, each of which has out-of-order behavior across waves (but may have in-order behavior within a wave).Example of RDNA 4 assembly from 3DMark's raytracing feature test, showing a basic block separately waiting on global memory loads and texture sampling requests issued by other basic blocksSimilarly, lgkmcnt gets separated into kmcnt for scalar memory loads and dscnt for LDS accesses. Scalar memory loads are out-of-order, which means the compiler must wait for all scalar memory loads to complete (kmcnt=0 or lgmkcnt=0) before using results from any pending scalar memory load. On RDNA 4, the compiler can interleave scalar memory and LDS accesses without having to wait for lgkmcnt=0.Intel and Nvidia's GPUs use software managed scoreboards. A scoreboard entry can be set or and waited on by any instruction, regardless of memory access type. Therefore RDNA 4's optimization isn't applicable to those other GPU architectures. A cost to Intel/Nvidia's approach is that utilizing a big memory request qu",

        "description": "Drivers and kernel-level software can't be translated automatically by Windows. Using a Windows PC with an Arm-based Snapdragon processor in it feels a lot like using a regular-old Intel or AMD PC these days, thanks to the work developers have put in to get their apps running natively on Arm chips and the work Microsoft has done on Windows' Prism technology for translating x86 apps to run on Arm processors. But some of the old compatibility gaps still remain. For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running. Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company announced that it's bringing its Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for Fortnite. Both are coming to Arm PCs \"later this year.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su.I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images; BIWhen a top analyst skewered AMD's software, CEO Lisa Su called him personally to chat.AMD's AI chips have struggled to compete against Nvidia's dominance, and software is its weakness.Those who know Su told Business Insider she will never settle for second place.What should a CEO do when their company is publicly called out for an inferior product? Many would stay silent. Not AMD CEO Lisa Su.In early February, AMD released new data showing how well its AI chips performed at training large language models, using benchmarks developed by a company called SemiAnalysis. Just weeks earlier, the same group had published a searing review of AMD's tentpole graphics processing unit.The analysts wrote that while the chip looks good on paper, reaching its potential in reality was almost impossible with AMD's existing software. Chief analyst Dylan Patel and the SemiAnalysis team spent five months assessing AMD's GPU, which has struggled to gain market share and mindshare against the dominant player, Nvidia.\"We were hopeful that AMD could emerge as a strong competitor to Nvidia in training workloads, but, as of today, this is unfortunately not the case,\" SemiAnalysis published in December.The next day, Patel got a call from Su. The call was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it lasted 90.\"Feedback is a gift even when it's critical,\" Su tweeted after the call. The new performance data released in February were a punch back in a fight that's far from over.2024 was the year of Lisa Su. She was Time and Chief Executive Magazine's CEO of the year.Last year, AMD outsold Intel in its data center business, overtaking its old rival in the traditional data center world. This became the triumphant apex of Su's first decade as CEO of AMD. Revenue for the whole of 2024 was up 14% year over year — gross profits up 22% — and yet when Su reported the results in February, the stock went down.As Su achieved what many thought impossible and conquered her old foil, Intel, a new one had already presented itself in AI prognosticator Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, Su's cousin born in the same region of Taiwan as her. Shareholders wouldn't let her forget her biggest rival.Whether AMD can meet the seemingly insurmountable challenge of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share may come down to the approaches of two Taiwanese-born, US-educated, distantly-related CEOs.Su has already stated the company's goals. She's leaning into open-source software and beefing up support for large language model training and inference customers. Most importantly, she's raising the bar for AMD's software so that it can better stand up to Nvidia's — since Huang has long professed that software is Nvidia's secret sauce.\"We are still in the very early stages with AI, and we believe there's no one-size-fits-all approach to AI compute,\" an AMD spokesperson told Business Insider. AMD declined to make Su available for an interview.BI spoke with nine people for this story — five of whom have at one point had a personal relationship with Su and three of whom worked under her at AMD. They said that whether in 2007, 2017, or 2027, the stoic, thoughtful, quietly confident executive walking the brightest stages in the tech world is exactly who she seems. Though she may never conquer Nvidia, she won't rest while she's in the number two spot. Her play involves intently listening to partners as well as critics, and it's worked before.AMD CEO Lisa Su's public presentation style has changed since she took over the company in 2014.AMDLisa Su says, 'Why not?'Some early indications suggested that starting at the bottom motivated Su to get to the top.Born in Taiwan and raised in New York, Su intentionally picked the most challenging STEM field she could think of: electrical engineering. After earning her doctorate, she received multiple offers to stay in academia but decided to join Texas Instruments instead, Dimitri Antoniadis, her MIT thesis advisor, told BI. She wanted to manage people and projects, she recently told Stanford business students. After leaving TI for IBM, she was tapped to serve as a technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and CEO.Antoniadis recalled late-night phone conversations with Su when she was at these \"juncture points\" in her career. She left IBM in 2007, spent four and a half years at Freescale Semiconductor, and then came to AMD in 2012.The professor got one such call in late 2014. Su had managed AMD's various business units and operations for nearly three years — deep in the weeds of the entire company yet without the authority to set the overall direction. She called Antoniadis when she was asked to take the CEO job, which meant going after a market dominated by Intel. The original Silicon Valley icon had a market capitalization of over $150 billion and a reputation for ruthlessness. AMD's market cap was just $2 billion.\"At the time, I said, 'Lisa, are you serious? Taking on Intel?' She said, 'Why not?'\" Antoniadis told BI.Su sought multiple opinions on the big decision to head AMD. Lip-Bu Tan, a legendary semiconductor CEO turned investor who will step into the Intel CEO role on March 18, was also on the call list. Tan and Su met years earlier when she was at Freescale Semiconductor, and he was impressed from the start, he told BI.Tan was fully aware of AMD's sad state at the time. The firm had completed two rounds of layoffs since 2011 and pulled out of the processor market. The company needed focus.\"Only the gaming business was doing well. The rest were struggling,\" Tan said. Despite this, he didn't hesitate to recommend the job to Su. He had just orchestrated a revival of a similar magnitude at Cadence Design Systems and knew the opportunity such a turnaround could be.\"The market value was less than $3 billion — you can't go wrong with that. It is so undervalued,\" Tan said of AMD.Su took over AMD on October 8, 2014. A 7% staff cut proceeded, and Su set out to make long-term bets and win back customers. Tan said Su soon had top tech execs like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Dell COO Jeff Clarke trusting her, mainly due to her hands-on style. Even for routine annual business reviews, Su knows all the numbers and listens intently to concerns, sources said.\"They love her. She is very engaged — very involved,\" Tan said.Su has evolved her style over her 10 years as CEO of AMD. She's somewhat less stoic, makes jokes onstage, wears brighter colors, has more perfectly coiffed hair, and has come to appreciate Christian Louboutin heels. AMD declined to comment on these details.\"I am not surprised at all where she is right now. I truly expected it,\" Antoniadis told BI.AMD's market cap has grown to about $160 billion as of Wednesday — much higher than its $2 billion market cap when Su first started. This month, all AI stocks have taken a dive amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policy shifts.Now, Su has a new miracle to perform.Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.AMDSu v. HuangIn 2018, Su sat with a handful of Wall Street analysts in a private meeting space near the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest tech conferences of the year, bustled in the massive building's halls.Su was just over three years into her job as CEO of AMD, and the company's stock hovered above just $10 per share.The analysts in that Las Vegas conference room had a lot of advice for the then 48-year-old CEO, according to a person present, who asked not to be named since the session was private. The room was full of men eager to tell Su how to seize on her progress and take AMD to the next level. There was chatter in the nerdier accelerated computing circles that machine learning was ready to scale, and the analysts weren't sure AMD was seeing the signs.Su took it all in and politely thanked everyone. She knew accelerated computing would change the world as early as 2017, she has since said in interviews. The graphics processing unit made that possible.At the time, the entertainment industry used them for gaming and graphics rendering. While AMD has designed this kind of hardware for two decades, Nvidia's Huang beat the entire tech industry to the punch when he identified the AI opportunity for GPUs and started building software to help it spread. Since ChatGPT's birth, Nvidia and AMD have been in an epic race — only Nvidia had a massive head start.Both Huang and Su are notoriously hardworking — late nights and weekends are a given.But Huang is a showman. He dominates a stage whether it be at the front of a boardroom or a concert arena. Su is less flashy. She rarely, if ever, raises her voice, and her business strategy echoes that quiet, inexhaustible, confident consistency, sources said.\"You know she's in charge, but she's also a very quiet leader,\" said Jodi Shelton, cofounder and CEO of the Global Semiconductor Alliance. Shelton recalled an intimate dinner at Su's Texas home with just the CEO and her husband, Daniel Lin, where Su asked most of the questions.\"She doesn't need to interject when someone's speaking. She doesn't have to be the loudest person in the room,\" Shelton continued.Onstage, Su often paces, making measured announcements. At team meetings, she drills for answers about what needs to be done next and delegates tasks, personally reviewing AMD's GPU distribution on spreadsheets, the AMD employees said.In a world where CEOs like former Intel leader Pat Gelsinger have announced plans such as five nodes in four years and fell short in execution, AMD has slowly marched forward. Even Nvidia's yearly cadence of new GPU generations has hit production and installation snags. Su is wary of overpromising and underexecuting, several sources said. Execution is non-negotiable.\"That's not very easy for people to do for such a long time,\" Lamini founder Sharon Zhou, who has committed to AMD hardware over Nvidia, told BI. \"Which is why I think she presents the main threat to",

        "description": "Nvidia's 50-series refresh has been pretty conservative so far. Nvidia has launched all of the GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs that it announced at CES, at least technically—whether you're buying from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel, it's nearly impossible to find any of these new cards at their advertised prices right now. But hope springs eternal, and newly leaked specs for GeForce RTX 5060 and 5050-series cards suggest that Nvidia may be announcing these lower-end cards soon. These kinds of cards are rarely exciting, but Steam Hardware Survey data shows that these xx60 and xx50 cards are what the overwhelming majority of PC gamers are putting in their systems. The specs, posted by a reliable leaker named Kopite and reported by Tom's Hardware and others, suggest a refresh that's in line with what Nvidia has done with most of the 50-series so far. Along with a move to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, the 5060 GPUs each come with a small increase to the number of CUDA cores, a jump from GDDR6 to GDDR7, and an increase in power consumption, but no changes to the amount of memory or the width of the memory bus. The 8GB versions, in particular, will probably continue to be marketed primarily as 1080p cards.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Not a lot of people actually need this thing, but if you do, it's very good. Even three years later, AMD's high-end X3D-series processors still aren't a thing that most people need to spend extra money on—under all but a handful of circumstances, your GPU will be the limiting factor when you're running games, and few non-game apps benefit from the extra 64MB chunk of L3 cache that is the processors' calling card. They've been a reasonably popular way for people with old AM4 motherboards to extend the life of their gaming PCs, but for AM5 builds, a regular Zen 4 or Zen 5 CPU will not bottleneck modern graphics cards most of the time. But high-end PC building isn't always about what's rational, and people spending $2,000 or more to stick a GeForce RTX 5090 into their systems probably won't worry that much about spending a couple hundred extra dollars to get the fastest CPU they can get. That's the audience for the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D, a 16-core, Zen 5-based, $699 monster of a processor that AMD begins selling tomorrow. If you're only worried about game performance (and if you can find one), the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the superior choice, for reasons that will become apparent once we start looking at charts. But if you want fast game performance and you need as many CPU cores as you can get for other streaming or video production or rendering work, the 9950X3D is there for you. (It's a little funny to me that this a chip made almost precisely for the workload of the PC building tech YouTubers who will be reviewing it.) It's also a processor that Intel doesn't have any kind of answer to.Read full article Comments",

AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is probably the best CPU you can buy if you're trying to put together a fast gaming PC, thanks to its eight Zen 5 CPU cores and extra helping of 3D V-Cache. You don't really need more CPU cores than this to play games, and most games benefit from the extra cache more than they do from a bit of extra clock speed. AMD announced today that it's following up the 9800X3D with two higher-end X3D processors next week. The 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D are both launching on March 12 for $599 and $699, respectively, the same as the launch pricing for the last-generation 7900X3D and 7950X3D but a couple hundred dollars more expensive than the current street pricing for the Ryzen 9900X and 9950X. AMD recommends the 9900X3D and 9950X3D to people whose gaming PCs also do other heavy-duty non-gaming work or for streamers whose gaming PCs are simultaneously running other apps. But they might also appeal to people who would normally just buy a 9800X3D because that processor has been difficult to find at its $479 MSRP since launching last fall. If a 9800X3D already costs nearly $600, why not spring for a faster chip if you can get one?Read full article Comments",

        "description": "For $549 and $599, AMD comes close to knocking out Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070. AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its early-2010s nadir partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money and later with CPUs that were better than anything Intel could offer. Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are also pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies. Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Hello you fine Internet folks, Hello you fine Internet folks,Today AMD has released their new RDNA4 architecture found in the RX 9000 series, with the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT GPUs launching first. These are cards targeting the high mid-range of the GPU market but not going after the highest end of the market like they did with RDNA2 and RDNA3.RDNA4 is the fourth iteration of the RDNA architecture from AMD and it has some very interesting changes and additions compared to prior RDNA architectures.AcknowledgmentsAMD sent over a Powercolor Hellhound RX 9070 and a Powercolor Hellhound RX 9070 XT for review and analysis. Architectural ImprovementsLet’s start with the high-level die diagram changes first.The die found in the RX 9070 series is fabricated on TSMC’s N4P node and has 53.9 billion transistors on a 356.5mm² die which give a density of roughly 151.2 million transistor per mm².The majority of the differences between the RX 9070 and the RX 9070 XT are 8 fewer Compute Units, approximately 450MHz boost clock, and an 84-watt power limit reduction.Cache Bandwidth and Hierarchy Changes AMD has doubled the number of banks for the L2 cache which has also doubled the amount of L2 per Shader Engine. In prior RDNA architectures there was 1MB of L2 cache per Shader Engine, so the RX 6900 XT had 4MB of L2 cache due to having 4 Shader Engines and the RX 7900 XTX had 6MB of L2 cache due to having 6 Shader Engines. With RDNA4 AMD has doubled the number of banks per L2 slice which has doubled the bandwidth of each L2 slice as well as doubled the amount of L2 cache per Shader Engine which means with the 4 Shader Engines that the RX 9070 XT has 8MB of L2 cache. It also appears as if AMD also increased the bandwidth of the Infinity Cache (MALL) as well.What is interesting is that the L1 cache no longer exists on RDNA4. It appears as if the L1 is now a read/write-coalescing buffer and no longer a dedicated cache level. This is a major change in the RDNA cache hierarchy, the L1 was added to RDNA1 in order to reduce the number of requests to the L2 as well as reduce the number of clients to the L2.Compute Unit and Matrix Unit UpdatesThere is an error in this slide; Named Barriers are not a part of RDNA4AMD added FP operations to the Scalar Unit in RDNA3.5 and they have kept those additions to the Scalar Unit with RDNA4. AMD has also improved the scheduler with Split Barriers which allows instructions to be issued in between completion of consuming or producing one block of work and waiting for other waves to complete their work.AMD has also added improvements to the register spill and fill behavior in the form of Register Block Spill/Fill operations which operates on up to 32 registers. A major reason for adding this capability was reducing unnecessary spill memory traffic for cases such as separately compiled functions by allowing code that knows which registers contain live state to pass that information to code that may need to save/restore registers to make use of them. RDNA4 has also significantly beefied-up the matrix units compared to RDNA3. The FP16/BF16 throughput has been doubled along with a quadrupling of the INT8 and INT4 throughput. RDNA4 has also added FP8 (E4M3) along with BF8 (E5M2) at the same throughput as INT8. RDNA4 has also added 4:2 sparsity to its matrix units. However, one part of the Compute Unit that hasn’t seen improvement is the dual-issuing capability.Ray AcceleratorMoving to the changes to AMD’s Ray Accelerator (RA) which has been a significant focus for AMD with RDNA4.AMD has added a second intersection engine which has doubled the number of ray-box and ray-triangle intersections up from 4 and 1 to 8 and 2 respectively. AMD has also moved from a BVH4 to a BVH8 structure.AMD has also added the ability for the ray accelerator to store results out of order, “Pack and Sort”. Packing allows the RA to skip ahead and process faster rays that don’t need to access memory or a higher latency cache level. Sorting allows the RA to preserve the correct ordering so that it appears to the program as if the instructions were executed in-order.Out of Order Memory AccessOne of the most exciting things that RDNA4 has added was out of order memory access. This is not like Nvidia’s Shader Execution Reordering, what SER allows for is reordering threads that hit or miss, as well as threads that go to the same cache or memory level, to be bundled in the same wave.This out of order memory access seems to be very similar to the capabilities that Cortex-A510 has. While the Cortex-A510 is an in-order core for Integer and Floating-Point operations, for memory operations A510 can absorb up to 2 cache misses without stalling the rest of the pipeline. The number of misses that a RDNA4 Compute Unit can handle is unknown but the fact that it can deal with memory accesses out of order is a new feature for a GPU to have.Dynamic RegistersAnd last but not least, AMD has added dynamic allocation of RDNA4’s registers.This allows shaders to request more registers than they usually can get. This provides the GPU with more opportunity for having more waves in flight at any given time. Dynamic register allocation along with the out of order memory access gives RDNA4 many tricks to hide the latency that some workloads, in particular ray tracing, have.Performance of RDNA4 at Different WattagesI’ll leave the majority of the benchmarking to the rest of the tech media; however, I do want to look at RDNA4’s behavior at various wattages.The RX 9070 does quite well at 154 watts, despite at being 44% the power compared to the RX 9070 XT at 348W, the RX 9070 at 154 watts get on average 70% the performance of the RX 9070 XT at 348 watts which is a 59% performance per watt advantage for the RX 9070 at 154 watts.ConclusionAMD’s brand new RDNA4 architecture has made many improvements to the core of the RDNA compute unit with much improved machine learning and ray tracing accelerators along with major improvements to the handling of latency sensitive workloads.However, RDNA4’s Compute Unit is not just the only improvements that AMD has made to RDNA4. AMD has also improved the cache bandwidth at the L2 and MALL levels along with making the L1 no longer a cache level but a read/write-coalescing buffer.However, with the launch of the RX 9070 series, I do wonder what a 500-600mm² RDNA4 die with a 384/512 bit memory bus would have performed like. I wonder if it could have competed with the 4090, or maybe even the 5090.If you like the content then consider heading over to the Patreon or PayPal if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.
