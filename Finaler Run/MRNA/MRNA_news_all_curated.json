        "description": "Moderna CEO and cofounder Stéphane Bancel probably never imagined he’d look back on March 2023 as the good old days. Then, he merely had to go before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and take a spitty dressing-down from Senator Bernie Sanders over the price of Moderna’s COVID vaccine. The company was held up as a poster child for “corporate greed.” For a U.S. pharma executive, though, that was more or less business as usual. Today, the situation is anything but. With the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaxxer, to be the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services this February, once-fringe medical theories have been escalated to the level of policy, throwing established scientific and regulatory norms into doubt. Among drugmakers, perhaps none is worse situated to absorb the D.C. vibe shift than Moderna, which is now being targeted not for its pricing but for its one and only product: mRNA-based vaccines. Kennedy has shown a particular distaste for mRNA vaccines, such as those that were rapidly developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech in response to the global outbreak of COVID-19. During the height of the pandemic, Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke authorization for COVID-19 vaccines and not approve any future ones, saying that the risks of adverse reactions and death weren’t adequately studied. These vaccines—which have been safely administered to billions of people around the world and in 2021 alone saved at least an estimated 14.4 million lives worldwide—have been the subject of conspiracy theories and misinformation since they were first authorized for emergency use in late 2020. Among the debunked claims of critics: the vaccines can alter a person’s genome; they contain microchips or tracking devices; They cause something dubbed turbo cancer. Several states, including Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina, Idaho, and Texas are considering laws that would severely limit or ban the use of mRNA vaccines. Louisiana and Texas have already ended mass vaccinations and any promotion of the vaccines. Now, Kennedy’s HHS is taking action against Moderna’s signature product. In the past month alone, the CDC has revised its public health recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA altered its vaccine approval process, and the government canceled a $766 million contract with Moderna to develop new vaccines against pandemic threats including H5N1 avian influenza. Taken together, these moves have effectively knee-capped Moderna’s business. They’ve also jeopardized public health, and spread uncertainty across the burgeoning landscape of next-generation RNA-based therapeutics. Moderna can ill afford an unfavorable regulatory environment, much less an administration seemingly bent on its destruction. The company, which declined to make executives available for this story, took in $3.2 billion last year—less than half of the year prior—at a net loss of $3.6 billion. For the first quarter this year, it brought in $100 million at a $1 billion loss. Although Moderna launched an RSV vaccine last year and is developing a personalized cancer immunotherapy, almost all of its money still comes from sales of COVID-19 shots, which are steadily declining. And with its entire technology under attack, Moderna’s future looks anything but certain. Going all in on mRNA While most pharma companies have grown by establishing franchises in particular diseases, Moderna has always been all-in on Bancel’s conception of a biotech “platform” company. The entire premise is right there in its ticker symbol: mRNA. The promise of the technology is appealing. Older vaccines typically consist of weakened or killed viruses, or parts of viruses, to mimic an infection and elicit an immune response. These vaccines are grown in eggs or cell cultures, purified, and mixed with adjuvants that help them work in the body. Historically, developing vaccines in this way has taken anywhere from 5 to 10 years. But mRNA vaccines don’t require any viruses, or eggs. Instead, they work by delivering into the body genetic “instructions,” in the form of mRNA molecules, that cells use to manufacture a protein called an antigen, which induces an immune response. The original COVID vaccine contained mRNA instructions to produce a signature “spike” protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. Because mRNA is “digital”—like DNA, it encodes a series of nucleotide letters (A, U, G, C)—creating new mRNA vaccines is a relatively simple matter of rearranging these letters to create a different antigen. mRNA is made in an egg- and cell-free manufacturing process, and once the sequence for a vaccine has been selected, it can be manufactured in as little as a few weeks. This speed and flexibility are what enabled the development of a working vaccine for COVID within a year of its discovery. And it is why many experts in infectious disease believe mRNA vaccines are an essential tool in responding to future pandemic threats. Bancel has been banking on mRNA not only as a vaccine platform but also as a breakthrough way of treating cancer and other diseases. Until last year, though, Moderna had brought just one product to the market: the Spikevax vaccine for COVID-19. In 2021, the company sold 807 million doses, pocketing $17.7 billion. The company’s stock soared—in 2021, Moderna’s market cap hovered around $200 billion, surpassing legacy drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen, and Merck. But demand for the vaccines has abated quickly. In 2022, Moderna had $18.4 billion in vaccine sales. In 2023, the year the public health emergency was declared over and the federal government phased out paying for the vaccine doses, Moderna’s sales were less than $7 billion. Last year, they more than halved yet again. Moderna’s second commercial product, an mRNA vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was approved by the FDA in May 2024, for people 60 years and older. Marketed as mRESVIA, it had total 2024 sales of $25 million. At the start of this year, Moderna’s stock was down about 90% from its pandemic peak. Moderna’s cash reserve, meanwhile, has dwindled from $18.2 billion at the end of 2022 to $8.4 billion today. Last fall, Bancel announced a plan to cut R&D spending by $1.1 billion by 2027 and to shelve five early-stage programs. This January, he said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference that the company would cut $1 billion in spending this year alone, and find another $500 million in cuts next year. As Moderna, which was founded in 2010, grew from 800 employees pre-pandemic to 5,600 full-time global employees at the end of 2023, it gained a reputation as a tough workplace that burned through talent. Even so, its recent departures have signaled a company in turmoil. Since late 2023, when chief commercial officer Arpa Garay left the company less than two years after joining from Merck, his former duties have been split between Bancel, covering sales and marketing, and Moderna’s president Stephen Hoge responsible for commercial pipeline strategy and medical affairs. In November 2024, Hoge took charge of sales, as well. “Stephen and Stephane will go down with the ship,” says a former employee speaking on background. “They’re a $10 billion company now—how does that save them? They’re in a really bad position.” Others are jumping. This February, CIO Brad Miller—who’d been driving the company’s “tech-driven insights” for just over two years—“retired” at age 52, as Moderna downsized its digital departments by about 50 employees, or 10%. Pharma folks took notice in March, when Kate Cronin, who’d led marketing since 2021, left the company and a month later joined Medtronic Diabetes. “When Kate Cronin left, I thought, that’s the rat leaving the sinking ship,” says another industry insider. Multiple employees in communications roles have also recently left the company. Keeping up with the FDA and CDC Moderna’s pipeline includes vaccines for everything from shingles to HIV, as well as therapeutics for cancer and rare diseases. But near-term, its hopes had been riding on a new, improved COVID vaccine, along with a first-of-its-a-kind combination COVID-flu vaccine. In the last couple of weeks, though, those hopes have been tempered, if not crushed, by changes at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which taken together could dramatically limit who will get access to such vaccines moving forward—and determine whether companies like Moderna will continue to make them at all. On May 31, Moderna had a partial win when the FDA approved its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, called mNEXSPIKE. But unlike its predecessor, which is licensed for use for all individuals 12 years of age and older, regardless of health-risk status—it was authorized for use only for people aged 65 and older, or aged 12 to 64 with a qualifying medical condition. (The FDA’s delayed approval in May of a non-mRNA COVID vaccine made by Novavax had the same restrictions.) People aged 65 and older account for the majority of COVID vaccines, and benefit the most from their protection. In previous years, as long as updated COVID shots showed evidence that they generated a comparable immune response to the previous year’s version, the FDA approved them for use for most people. Now, to get approval for anyone under 65 and without an underlying medical condition, vaccine makers will have to show additional safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials. (The FDA and its advisers had previously considered it unfeasible to run such trials quickly enough.) Calling for “robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,” the new requirements were put forth without the usual input from independent outside advisers. Between 100 million to 200 million Americans (of a total population of 347 million)",

        "description": "HHS said it pulled funding for testing because the shots are \"under-tested.\" The Department of Health and Human Services—under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—has canceled millions of dollars in federal funding awarded to Moderna to produce an mRNA vaccine against influenza viruses with pandemic potential, including the H5N1 bird flu currently sweeping US poultry and dairy cows. Last July, the Biden administration's HHS awarded Moderna $176 million to \"accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines.\" In the administration's final days in January, HHS awarded the vaccine maker an additional $590 million to support \"late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccines.\" The funding would also go to the development of five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza. On Wednesday, as news broke that the Trump administration was reneging on the contract, Moderna reported positive results from an early trial of a vaccine targeting H5 influenza viruses. In a preliminary trial of 300 healthy adults, the vaccine candidate appeared safe and boosted antibody levels against the virus by 44.5-fold.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "In this GEN webinar, scientists from Moderna and seqWell will present several applications of a fully scalable, one-step NGS library preparation workflow that span antibody development and biomanufacturing. The post NGS Workflows for Expedited Development & Manufacturing of Therapeutic Antibodies appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. REGISTER NOWBroadcast Date: Wednesday, April 2, 2025Time: 8:00 am PT, 11:00 am ET, 17:00 CESTThe impacts of next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be seen throughout multiple phases of therapeutic antibody development, from discovery and engineering to manufacturing. Sequencing is a critical tool in the identification of high-affinity, highly specific candidates, optimizing expression systems, and performing quality control to ensure the genetic integrity, consistency, and safety of the therapeutic. While each phase of the development pipeline has different NGS needs—particularly sample input type, sample number, and turnaround time—the ability to use a single, streamlined workflow with the flexibility to address multiple NGS applications throughout antibody development can greatly accelerate therapeutic timelines.In this GEN webinar, scientists from Moderna and seqWell will present several applications of a fully scalable, streamlined NGS library preparation workflow that span antibody development and biomanufacturing. In the first presentation, Nasthas Lacerda Almeida, a research associate, from Next Generation Analytics (NGA) at Moderna, will present an optimized clonal antibody sequencing approach, optimized for speed and scalability, using an automated, highly multiplexed library preparation method. In the second presentation, Joe Mellor, PhD, co-founder & CSO, seqWell, will show data highlighting how this same streamlined library prep workflow can be harnessed for early-stage synthetic construct screening as well as an application used to address clonality concerns due to bacteria co-transformation.During the webinar, you’ll learn: How Moderna performs high-throughput, accurate clonal antibody sequencing using de novo assembly of NGS short readsHow to use NGS to identify impurities caused by plasmid co-transformation in biologics discovery pipelinesHow rapid, massively multiplexed NGS library prep can eliminate bottlenecks in ultra-high-throughput synthetic construct screeningHow a single, automated, one-step library preparation workflow supports early- and late-stage NGS needs resulting in cost and labor savings, increases throughput and workflow speed, and enhances the overall quality of resultsA live Q&A session will follow the presentation, offering you a chance to pose questions to our expert panelists.Nasthas Lacerda Almeida Research AssociateModernaJoe Mellor, PhD Co-founder & CSO seqWellWebinar produced with support from: The post NGS Workflows for Expedited Development & Manufacturing of Therapeutic Antibodies appeared first on GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News.",
