        "description": "WSJ report says OpenAI mulling federal complaint as Microsoft stalls restructuring plan. OpenAI executives have discussed filing an antitrust complaint with US regulators against Microsoft, the company's largest investor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two long-term AI partners. OpenAI, which develops ChatGPT, has reportedly considered seeking a federal regulatory review of the terms of its contract with Microsoft for potential antitrust law violations, according to people familiar with the matter. The potential antitrust complaint would likely argue that Microsoft is using its dominant position in cloud services and contractual leverage to suppress competition, according to insiders who described it as a \"nuclear option,\" the WSJ reports. The move could unravel one of the most important business partnerships in the AI industry—a relationship that started with a $1 billion investment by Microsoft in 2019 and has grown to include billions more in funding, along with Microsoft's exclusive rights to host OpenAI models on its Azure cloud platform.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Microsoft and OpenAI are engaged in tense negotiations that could unravel one of the most important alliances in AI and fundamentally reorder the industry.Why it matters: Microsoft has injected billions of dollars in OpenAI and made it a cornerstone of its AI strategy, but the companies have also remained rivals that, in many cases, offer competing AI services.State of play: The two companies have been in talks for months to amend their partnership, with OpenAI needing approval from Microsoft to move forward with the corporate restructuring it has promised recent investors it would make.Driving the news: The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that tensions have escalated between the two companies, with OpenAI considering a \"nuclear option\" of accusing Microsoft of violating antitrust laws.That's a risky gambit that could backfire as tighter government oversight could ultimately fall on OpenAI itself.Zoom in: The latest sticking point is over whether Microsoft would have access to the intellectual property behind Windsurf, the coding startup OpenAI reportedly acquired last month.Under their most recent agreement, signed in 2023, Microsoft has access to all of OpenAI's technology, including any it gets via acquisition. An exception could be made, but would have to be negotiated.OpenAI, meanwhile, has been floating the notion that both companies might save themselves some regulatory headaches if Microsoft doesn't have access to Windsurf, given it already owns GitHub, which makes a competing product. It's the latest in a series of issues that have cropped up between the companies, who find themselves in the position of being both partners and competitors.Zoom out: Ultimately, there are far larger issues at play than whether Microsoft has access to Windsurf's technology. OpenAI needs Microsoft's go-ahead for a restructuring that OpenAI wants to achieve soon in order to meet commitments it made to recent investors. That means translating Microsoft's current share of OpenAI profits, up to a certain point, into a specific stake in the company.Another big sticking point relates to a trigger in their existing deal that calls for Microsoft's access to be significantly curtailed once OpenAI has reached the threshold of artificial general intelligence. Right now Microsoft has extremely broad rights until AGI is reached and limited access beyond that point.And of course, there are lots of dollars on the table, from what stake Microsoft gets in OpenAI's operation, to how much server business OpenAI sends Microsoft's way to how much the two companies collaborate or compete for consumer and corporate subscriptions.Late Monday The Information reported that OpenAI wants Microsoft to forego its rights to future profits in exchange for a roughly 33% stake in the restructured company, according to a person who had spoken to OpenAI executives. Between the lines: There's a lot at play here and plenty of potential sticking points.Sources close to both companies indicate considerable hope that there is a deal that can make sense.Yes, but: Both companies are also eager to show each other — and the world — that they have alternative plans and are ready to play rough if need be.Microsoft has been expanding its own bench of AI talent, from its deal to bring in Mustafa Suleyman to the more recent move tapping Jay Parikh as head of a Core AI unit.It has also been expanding its offering of non-OpenAI models via Azure, most recently adding xAI's Grok to the mix.OpenAI, which once got all its compute capacity from Microsoft, has moved to diversify, first with its Stargate project with Oracle and SoftBank and more recently in a deal with Google to use its cloud as well.What they're saying: \"We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone,\" the companies said in a joint statement. \"Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come.\" Microsoft and OpenAI are engaged in tense negotiations that could unravel one of the most important alliances in AI and fundamentally reorder the industry.Why it matters: Microsoft has injected billions of dollars in OpenAI and made it a cornerstone of its AI strategy, but the companies have also remained rivals that, in many cases, offer competing AI services.State of play: The two companies have been in talks for months to amend their partnership, with OpenAI needing approval from Microsoft to move forward with the corporate restructuring it has promised recent investors it would make.Driving the news: The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that tensions have escalated between the two companies, with OpenAI considering a \"nuclear option\" of accusing Microsoft of violating antitrust laws.That's a risky gambit that could backfire as tighter government oversight could ultimately fall on OpenAI itself.Zoom in: The latest sticking point is over whether Microsoft would have access to the intellectual property behind Windsurf, the coding startup OpenAI reportedly acquired last month.Under their most recent agreement, signed in 2023, Microsoft has access to all of OpenAI's technology, including any it gets via acquisition.

Tensions between longtime partners OpenAI and Microsoft have reportedly reached a point where OpenAI executives have discussed accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior and seeking a federal regulatory review of the terms of their contract. [contact-form-7] The tensions center in part on whether Microsoft would have access to the intellectual property of Windsurf, if OpenAI acquires that coding startup, and how big Microsoft’s share of OpenAI would be if OpenAI converts into a public-benefit corporation, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (June 16), citing unnamed sources. Asked about the report by the WSJ, the companies told the publication in a joint statement: “We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone. Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come.” The reported dispute over the intellectual property of Windsurf came about because the agreement between the two companies provides Microsoft with access to all of OpenAI’s intellectual property (IP), but because they have competing products for coding, OpenAI does not want Microsoft to have access to the IP of Windsurf, which OpenAI is acquiring for $3 billion, according to the report. In the case of OpenAI’s planned conversion into a public-benefit corporation, Microsoft is reportedly asking for a larger stake in the new company that would result from that move than OpenAI is willing to give, the report said. The companies have reportedly also disagreed about whether OpenAI can partner with other cloud providers and whether Microsoft would still have access to OpenAI’s technology after OpenAI says its models have achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI), per the report. It was reported in May that Microsoft and OpenAI were renegotiating their partnership deal to one in which the software giant would protect its equity stake while ensuring access to future technologies, and OpenAI gets more flexibility, with a possible initial public offering in its future. During that same month, it was reported that one of the key issues in these discussions was how much equity in a restructured OpenAI Microsoft would get in exchange for the $13 billion-plus it has invested in the startup.

So what's the approach that software engineers should be taking to get the most use out of them?GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke explained what he believes is the \"key for winning\" in this arena during an episode of \"The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck\" released Thursday.\"I think the key for winning is to have a continuum where you can have an agent write code for you and submit a pull request, but then if you as a developer see that code and you want to make three quick changes, you've got to be able to take that onto a local machine and just make those changes,\" Dohmke said.The worst alternative, he said, is where a developer would be \"trying to figure out how do I provide now feedback or prompt to describe in natural language where I already know how to do it in programming language.\"Such a situation would be \"basically replacing something that I can do in 3 seconds with something that might potentially take 3 minutes or even longer and that's obviously not more productivity, that's less productivity,\" Dohmke said.In other words, software developers should be able to augment code generated by AI tools on the fly instead of wasting valuable time directing the AI to make such a change.\"Enabling developers to move between those categories and being able to pick the agent that provides the best ROI or do it themselves, I think that's the key for winning in the next few years,\" he concluded.During a recent Q&A session at startup campus Station F at VivaTech in Paris, Dohmke also talked about the buzzy \"vibe coding\" phenomenon.OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy coined the term earlier this year to describe heavily leaning on AI tools to write code for you, allowing you to \"fully give in to the vibes\" and \"forget the code even exists,\" in his words.Dohmke said in the Q&A that he doesn't think startups can run on vibe coding alone.A \"non-technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers,\" he said, noting they \"can't build a complex system to justify the next round.\"\"The value of your startup isn't defined by what you can develop using cheap measures,\" Dohmke said.Read the original article on Business Insider GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke talked about the future of AI coding agents on a recent podcast.GitHubThe CEO of GitHub described the \"key for winning\" when it comes to AI coding tools for software engineers.Thomas Dohmke said it's key for an AI agent to write code that the developer can quickly change using their own skills.\"Being able to pick the agent that provides the best ROI or do it themselves\" is vital, he added.AI coding tools are everywhere.

        "description": "I’ve been feeling grossly inadequate, career-wise. Some of this has been driven by my perception that the economy is failing and I’m going down with it, and my addiction to reading industry trends on LinkedIn.Don’t get me wrong, I love LinkedIn. The anticipation of logging on and, fingers crossed, earning my long-awaited prize of a new client, job invite or contract is what drives me. But lately, I’ve been opening up to anxiety-inducing posts like, “Last night, an AI destroyed my career opportunities, but now I have a million-dollar business,” or “My startup sold for $20 million, and I’m an investor now,” and “I built an app that was so dumb, and then a community of millions downloaded it; here’s how I did it!” or “I just earned a massive sponsorship and partnership with [name your favorite celebrity],” and I just lost it. The upside of envy It seems like everyone but me is thriving in their new super-fab job, reaping the benefits of AI, or sharing highly informed commentary on a topic I know nothing about; then I see 15,000 engaging comments on their posts! Some people take selfies, use skin filters, and celeb-obsess on Instagram. But for me, I’m all about LinkedIn and it’s been killing my creator spirit. But the real truth is very painful and inconvenient: I am coldly and blisteringly envious. Warren Buffet quipped: “As an investor, you get something out of all the deadly sins—except for envy. Being envious of someone else is pretty stupid. Wishing them badly, or wishing you did as well as they did—all it does is ruin your day. Doesn’t hurt them at all, and there’s zero upside to it.”But what if you could prevent this awful feeling, and turn it into a business opportunity? Even when you aren’t religious, this quote from the bible makes sense: “For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice,” James 3:16. Right now, jealousy seems to be at an all-time high in the United States. Some people are having such extreme career and financial success these days. If you are like me, you scratch your head daily and ask yourself, “How they are doing this amid layoffs and a souring political and economic environment?” And then, “What am I doing wrong that I can’t succeed too? Don’t I deserve success? I work so hard.” I imagine that many of you who are reading this are, like me, not feeling successful or satisfied. I know this to be true because after I read yet another “I’m winning” post, I go right to the comments. I’m not seeing the glass half full when comments I read are lined with the bitterness of regret and the sour taste of envy. You know those posts, the ones where the first comment makes a resentful or snarky complaint about the privileged, the well-connected, or the trust fund baby, or how they slept their way to the top. The morally upright you tries to dismiss such comments, but the envy in us feels some satisfaction knowing that we are not alone. Feeling envious or jealous is no way to work or grow a brand or a business. At some point, it will consume your entrepreneurial spirit, your happiness, and your time, just like it did mine. But I decided to repackage how to approach my feelings of envy, and it placed me on a path of professional and creative recovery. Give these five ideas a try to see if they help you like they are helping me. 1. Define success Have we forgotten how to do this since we are so focused on other people? Do you define success as financial stability and comfort, or do you define it as having optimal health? Maybe you define success as finding hope, happiness, and abundance even in moments of despair? What does the outcome look like and what does it feel like for you? Defining your own version of success can arm you against self-pity, anger, and most certainly envy. Your version of success will be unique to you. After you define what success is for you, put the vision of success at the beginning of a journey map or flowchart and backtrack to get to where you are now. I find that seeing success first can prevent stagnation. As you build toward your vision of success, know that you will find “envy potholes” filled with people who appear to have already reached the goals you’ve been trying to reach for yourself. You may feel that the grass is greener on the other side, and that might be true. But this part of the story is about you finding a place in your own heart first—where you can see your own success on paper and begin to act. 2. Embrace social comparison Social media, with repeated use and exposure, makes us feel that we know successful people like they are friends, and that they see us. Social media is not real, and the people we see on it are not our friends. This actually reminds me of the woman on the plane who screamed “That MF is not real!” Remember her crash out the next time you see a person social posting their perfection. But scrolling with the intention to conduct research can help you learn, copy, admire, then repackage what you’ve learned to align with your own brand. Study competitive products, watch how your perceived competitor creates content, read their posts, add them to a social media monitoring platform and run analytics. Study, study, and study more. Become a student of your jealousy. Identifying insights instead of flaws is empowering—not spiritually depleting and extractive. Copy what you are jealous of and apply your own creativity to it. Replacing your competitiveness with curiosity will be a mental and career game changer. Of course, you could put blinders on and never consume anyone else’s success content to keep your sanity. But if you are in business and are an entrepreneur like me, you’ll need to use all your social media tools for business outreach and to broadcast what problems you’re solving for others. 3. Express gratitude Speaking your gratitude out loud instantly changes your energy. Have you noticed that when you doomscroll you forget where you are and your surroundings go dark? I combat this when I do my morning runs. The first 10 minutes I express thanks for my health, my children, whatever is left over in my bank account, my current clients, current contracts—no matter how small, the sun, moon, air, trees, and light. I also use a mantra. One of my mantras is I will bring health and wealth to Birk Creative this quarter.Gratitude and mantras pull me from barbed wire thoughts and back to the present moment, which is always the best place to be. Force yourself to speak positivity into existence. What also works for me is to put away my screens, take a deep breath, relax my shoulders, roll my neck, and stretch. This helps me to remember I am a human and connected to the earth. 4. Beat the algorithm Nope. There’s no way to beat the algorithm, but you can try to trick it. Force yourself to not look at, linger on, or tap at content that triggers your envy. Find and like content that is the opposite of what you typically consume. Click “like” on things that bring you joy, a smile, or a laugh. Just make sure something about it brings you to a place of learning that lines up with your vision of success. Focus on your body’s response to this feeling. Does your body relax or tense up? Do you keep scrolling or do you hang on and rewatch? Rewatching content to understand it is better for this exercise than empty scrolling to the next post. There’s no way to stop unwanted content on social media channels from showing up, but you can program new content. Delete an app and don’t visit it for a few days, maybe a week, and then reinstall it. Visit the profile of a person you are jealous of—make a screen shot and repost something of theirs you like or recreate it to add your own spin. Experiment with this strategy every day for at least a week. As another idea, look for business inspiration quotes and like them or repost them. Prompt an LLM to give you five quotes on positivity, then plug them into Canva to make your own positivity quotes. Write an essay based on the quotes; relate it to your experience and share it. What’s your favorite color? Prompt and create a beautiful image online that includes your favorite color and use that image to accompany the post. Here’s a prompt: A [fill in your color] flower floats above the ocean, under a [fill in your favorite color] sky with white fluffy clouds [water color painting style]. Use this image to accompany your essay; post it to your favorite social media channel. Stumbling across someone else’s path of success can distract you with jealousy. Instead, try to find just one thing to authentically celebrate about the person or product you are jealous of. You know the saying: If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all. Make a habit of finding something nice to say to combat your envy. 5. Create or refine your own brand If there was ever a time to get to know AI it would be right now. Even if you are tired of hearing about professional branding, creating your own is the one thing that will keep you from looking outward and being jealous and force you to look within and reinvent yourself. A professional and personal brand also helps to keep focused on creating your own platform for business growth and personal development. For those with a reservoir of content, go back to your saved articles, essays, YouTube videos, and social media posts, and repurpose them all using an AI tool like Whisper, Opus if it’s video, or Perplexity. Copy the words or YouTube link, paste it in the AI tool, and prompt it to create fresh buckets of bite-sized content that you can share. Or feed it to the AI and ask it to analyze your content and write your new professional brand statement. (To accompany this article, I created a playlist on YouTube called Songs to Help You Not Be Jealous.) Use these tools to help you hone in on what you are good at by reviewing your co",

You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive,\" Hoffman said in a video he published on his YouTube channel on Thursday.Hoffman was addressing questions sent in by college students on how they should best navigate the job hunt. Several students had asked Hoffman about AI's impact on their employment prospects.Hoffman said in his video that AI's impact on jobs is a \"legitimate worry,\" but he added that students could try to use it to their advantage.\"Look, on this side, it's transforming the workspace, entry-level work, employers' confusion.

Last month, the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei, said in an interview with Axios that AI may wipe out half of all entry-level office jobs.In the interview, Amodei said he expects unemployment to rise by 10% to 20% over the next one to five years.\"Most of them are unaware that this is about to happen,\" he said. \"It sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.\"But not all business leaders agree with Amodei's dire prediction.Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip giant Nvidia, told reporters on the sidelines of VivaTech 2025 in Paris this week that Amodei was wrong.\"I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says,\" Huang said of Amodei. \"He thinks AI is so scary, but only they should do it.\"Huang said that while some jobs would disappear, AI could also create new job opportunities.\"Do I think AI will change jobs? It will change everyone's — it's changed mine,\" Huang said.Mark Cuban had a similar response to Amodei's comments as Huang. The \"Shark Tank\" star wrote in a BlueSky post last month that AI will create, and not destroy, jobs.\"Someone needs to remind the CEO that at one point there were more than 2m secretaries. There were also separate employees to do in office dictation.

        "description": "Microsoft has added a new way to cut and clean up videos in Clipchamp, its online editing tool. The latest feature lets users remove parts of a video by deleting lines from an automatically AI generated transcript, making the process simpler for content with a lot of speech. Instead of scrubbing through a timeline, editors can now work directly with text. Once a transcript is created, users can highlight sections of dialogue they don’t want, such as off-topic discussion or long pauses, and remove them in one step. The video then updates to reflect those cuts. The new method is aimed at people who often edit recordings of meetings, webinars, podcasts, and other spoken content. It’s designed to save time and make editing more accessible, especially when working with longer clips. Also read: Want to Edit Videos Like A Pro? Use these Best Free and Paid Video Editing Tools in 2025To use it, editors open a video in Clipchamp and go to the new “Transcript” tab. From there, they generate a transcript, then delete lines of text they wish to cut. The tool handles the rest in the background. The Transcript tab has now taken the place of the old Captions tab, although options for editing and downloading captions remain available through the menu. This update is being rolled out first to users with work accounts. Microsoft says access for personal users will follow soon. Earlier this year, the company announced several improvements for Clipchamp, including new editing modes, better grouping tools, and a clearer layout. Some of those have already reached users, as Clipchamp continues to evolve into a more capable platform for everyday video editing.Read next:• These Are the Best AI Video Generators for Creating Stunning Content in Minutes• Invisible Emissions From Digital Mics Could Let Strangers Hear You Through Concrete",

        "description": "When I first encountered AI, it wasn’t anything like the sophisticated tools we have today. In the 1990s, my introduction came in the form of a helpful, but mostly frustrating, digital paperclip. Clippy, Microsoft’s infamous assistant, was designed to help, but it often got in the way, popping up at the worst moments with advice no one asked for. AI has evolved since then. Major companies like Apple are investing billions, and tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E have reshaped how we interact with technology. Yet, one challenge from Clippy’s era lingers—understanding and adapting to user intent. The original promise of AI was to create experiences that felt seamless, intuitive, and personal. AI was supposed to anticipate our needs and provide support that felt natural. So, why do so many systems today still feel mechanical and rigid—more Clippy than collaborator? When AI assistance is a burden When first introduced, Clippy was a bold attempt at computer-guided assistance. Its purpose was groundbreaking at the time, but it quickly became known more for interruptions than useful assistance. You’d pause when typing, and Clippy would leap into action with a pop-up: “It looks like you’re writing a letter!” Its biggest flaw wasn’t just being annoying: It lacked contextual awareness. Unlike modern AI tools, Clippy’s interactions were static and deterministic, triggered by fixed inputs. There was no learning from previous interactions and no understanding of the user’s preferences or current tasks. Whether you were drafting a report or working on a spreadsheet, Clippy offered the same generic advice—ignoring the evolving context and failing to provide truly helpful, personalized assistance. Is AI destined to be like Clippy? Even with today’s advancements, many AI assistants still feel underwhelming. Siri is a prime example. Though capable of setting reminders or answering questions, it often requires users to speak in very specific ways. Deviate from the expected phrasing, and it defaults to, “I didn’t understand that.” This is more than a UX flaw—it reveals a deeper issue. Too many AI systems still operate under a one-size-fits-all mentality, failing to accommodate the needs of individual users. With Siri, for instance, you’re often required to speak in a specific, rigid format for it to process your request effectively. This creates an experience that feels less like assistance and more like a chore. Building a smarter assistant isn’t just about better models. It’s about retaining context, respecting privacy, and delivering personalized, meaningful experiences. That’s not just technically difficult—it’s essential. Helpful AI requires personalization Personalization is what will finally break us out of the Clippy cycle. When AI tools remember your preferences, learn from your behavior, and adapt accordingly, they shift from being tools to trusted partners. The key to this will be communication. Most AI today speaks in a one-dimensional tone, no matter who you are or what your emotional state is. The next leap in AI won’t just be about intelligence, it’ll be about emotional intelligence. But intelligence isn’t only about remembering facts. It’s also about how an assistant communicates. For AI to truly feel useful, it needs more than functionality. It needs personality. That doesn’t mean we need overly chatty bots. It means assistants that adjust tone, remember personal context, and build continuity. That’s what earns trust and keeps users engaged. While not every user may want an assistant with a personality or emotions, everyone can benefit from systems that adapt to our unique needs. The outdated one-size-fits-all approach is still common in many AI tools today and risks alienating users, much like Clippy’s impersonal method back in the early days. For AI to thrive in the long term it must be designed with real humans in mind. Building Clippy 2.0 Now imagine a “Clippy 2.0”—an assistant that doesn’t interrupt but understands when to offer help. One that remembers your work habits, predicts what you need, and responds in a way that feels natural and tailored to you. It could help you schedule meetings, provide intelligent suggestions, and adapt its tone to fit the moment. Whether it has a personality or not, what matters is that it adapts to—and respects the uniqueness of every user. It might even respond with different tones or emotions depending on your reactions, creating an immersive experience. This kind of intelligent assistant would blend seamlessly into your routine, saving you time and reducing friction. Clippy may have been a trailblazer, but it lacked the technological foundation to live up to its potential. With the advances we’ve made today, we now have the tools to build a “Clippy 2.0”—an AI assistant capable of transforming the way we interact with technology. Although maybe this time, it doesn’t need to come in the form of a paperclip with a goofy smile. Oleksandr Kosovan is the CEO and founder of MacPaw.",

These people asked not to be identified discussion private matters.It's unclear how far along the discussions are, or whether the deal will change or pan out. The details of how this customer will be charged may also be in flux. Microsoft typically sells per-seat software licenses that cost a certain amount each month, however, the company could include consumption-based pricing this time, which is a new trend in AI. One way of estimating the potential size of such as deal would be looking at the current sticker price for Copilot, which is $30 per user per month. Adding 1 million licenses for the tool would be worth about $360 million a year for Microsoft. It's unlikely that such a customer would pay the official sticker price, given the volume of licenses, even if Microsoft charges that way.Still, adding such a large number of new Copilot users in one go would be a big win for Microsoft as it tries to increase adoption of its AI tools. Microsoft has made massive investments in developing these new offerings, but is still trying to figure out the best way to make money from them. Some customers, competitors, and company insiders have been skeptical of Copilot's capabilities and the evolving business model. Microsoft declined to comment.Recently, the company developed a new plan to simplify its many AI offerings by streamlining how the products are pitched to customers, according to internal slides from a recent presentation.It's unclear which customer is adding the licenses, but there aren't many companies with workforces that size.Amazon has more than a million employees. However, an Amazon employee told BI that it's unlikely Amazon will use Copilot because it has warned staff in the past about using external AI tools. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.In late 2023, Amazon agreed to spend more than $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365 services, BI reported previously. That deal included about 550,000 seats of Microsoft's M365 E5 product for corporate workers and 1 million seats of M365 F5 for frontline staff such as fulfillment center employees, a person familiar with the matter told BI at the time.Amazon employees will migrate to Microsoft's cloud applications on a \"rolling basis,\" according to a recent internal memo previously reported by BI, and includes services such as Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

It's unlikely that such a customer would pay the official sticker price, given the volume of licenses, even if Microsoft charges that way.Still, adding such a large number of new Copilot users in one go would be a big win for Microsoft as it tries to increase adoption of its AI tools. Microsoft has made massive investments in developing these new offerings, but is still trying to figure out the best way to make money from them. Some customers, competitors, and company insiders have been skeptical of Copilot's capabilities and the evolving business model. Microsoft declined to comment.Recently, the company developed a new plan to simplify its many AI offerings by streamlining how the products are pitched to customers, according to internal slides from a recent presentation.It's unclear which customer is adding the licenses, but there aren't many companies with workforces that size.Amazon has more than a million employees. However, an Amazon employee told BI that it's unlikely Amazon will use Copilot because it has warned staff in the past about using external AI tools. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.In late 2023, Amazon agreed to spend more than $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365 services, BI reported previously. That deal included about 550,000 seats of Microsoft's M365 E5 product for corporate workers and 1 million seats of M365 F5 for frontline staff such as fulfillment center employees, a person familiar with the matter told BI at the time.Amazon employees will migrate to Microsoft's cloud applications on a \"rolling basis,\" according to a recent internal memo previously reported by BI, and includes services such as Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The memo did not mention Copilot.Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

        "description": "The publicly available exploits provide a near-universal way to bypass key protections. Researchers have unearthed two publicly available exploits that completely evade protections offered by Secure Boot, the industry-wide mechanism for ensuring devices load only secure operating system images during the boot-up process. Microsoft is taking action to block one exploit and allowing the other one to remain a viable threat. As part of Tuesday's monthly security update routine, Microsoft patched CVE-2025-3052, a Secure Boot bypass vulnerability affecting more than 50 device makers. More than a dozen modules that allow devices from these manufacturers to run on Linux allow an attacker with physical access to turn off Secure Boot and, from there, go on to install malware that runs before the operating system loads. Such “evil maid” attacks are precisely the threat Secure Boot is designed to prevent. The vulnerability can also be exploited remotely to make infections stealthier and more powerful if an attacker has already gained administrative control of a machine. A single point of failure The underlying cause of the vulnerability is a critical vulnerability in a tool used to flash firmware images on the motherboards of devices sold by DT Research, a manufacturer of rugged mobile devices. It has been available on VirusTotal since last year and was digitally signed in 2022, an indication it has been available through other channels since at least that earlier date.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Report: Deal marks shift from exclusive Microsoft partnership as AI compute needs soar. OpenAI has struck a deal to use Google's cloud computing infrastructure for AI despite the two companies' fierce competition in the space, reports Reuters. The agreement, finalized in May after months of negotiations, marks a shift in OpenAI's strategy to diversify its computing resources beyond Microsoft Azure, which had been its exclusive cloud provider until January. Microsoft's long-standing partnership with OpenAI dates back to 2019, with significant expansions of investment from the computer giant in 2021 and 2023. In October, The Information reported that the ChatGPT maker had begun to seek data center deals elsewhere, citing the need for more AI data center servers faster than Microsoft could supply them. Under the new deal, Google Cloud will provide additional computing capacity to help OpenAI train and run its AI models. For OpenAI, the partnership addresses growing demands for computing power as the company's annual revenue reached $10 billion as of June, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters.Read full article Comments",

It's one of the hardest proving grounds,\" Wayve CEO Alex Kendall told Business Insider during a test drive ahead of the launch.The news comes after the UK government announced it would fast-track approval for pilots of self-driving taxis from 2027 to spring 2026.Wayve and Uber declined to say when the initial deployment will begin, or which global carmaker would provide the vehicles for the robotaxi service.After largely abandoning plans to build its own self-driving cars, Uber has shifted strategy and struck a spree of deals to add robotaxis operated by self-driving companies to its app.The company has a partnership with Google-backed Waymo to operate its autonomous taxis on the Uber platform in Austin and Phoenix, and has signed similar deals with Chinese robotaxi startups WeRide and Pony.AI.Uber inked its deal with Wayve last year, agreeing to deploy self-driving vehicles powered by the British startup's technology on its platform in multiple markets around the world.Uber also invested in Wayve through an extension of the company's Series C fundraising round, which raised $1.05 billion from investors including Softbank, Nvidia, and Microsoft.The London-based startup, which has been testing its fleet of autonomous Ford Mach-Es with a safety driver in London for several years, has quickly become one of the buzziest names in the robotaxi industry.Wayve says its \"AI driver\" runs on an end-to-end AI model — an approach also adopted by Tesla — allowing it to react to the physical world in the same way a human would and drive anywhere, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps to operate their robotaxis.Speaking to Business Insider from the back of a Wayve self-driving car in central London, Wayve CEO Kendall said the company had tested its autonomous vehicles in 90 cities over the past 90 days.\"It's a real demonstration of how well this technology generalizes. The diversity we saw on these roads is immense, from winding roads in the Swiss Alps and dirt tracks in Italy to diverse cities like Vancouver and Tokyo,\" said Kendall.He said the vehicles in the robotaxi service in London will initially use a mixed suite of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar (laser-based sensors), adding that the chaotic nature of London's roads made it the perfect place to trial Wayve's technology without a safety driver. During BI's test ride, Wayve's AI driver navigated a number of obstacles, such as roadworks in London's busy Kings Cross district.\"The ambition is to be driving in every city Uber operates in with our robotaxis.

        "description": "One in 18 LinkedIn users in Switzerland lists “CEO” as their title. In Switzerland, 5.48% of all LinkedIn users list “CEO” in their profile, the highest share recorded in the entire analysis.One in every 23 LinkedIn users holds the CEO title in Sweden, a rate that places it well ahead of countries like Italy and France.Germany has the highest total number of CEOs on LinkedIn.A recent data review has revealed surprising concentrations of self-declared CEOs across LinkedIn, especially in smaller European economies. The findings follow a platform-related incident where a user momentarily assumed the identity of LinkedIn’s chief without authentication, sparking questions around professional identity standards.The study, curated by Heepsy, focused solely on countries with over a million LinkedIn users. The aim was to draw meaningful comparisons by tracking the share of members who label themselves as chief executive officers.Topping the chart, Switzerland displayed the densest clustering. Roughly one out of every 18 profiles there carries the CEO tag. This equates to 74,000 individuals among its 1.35 million user base. The high frequency may signal a strong startup culture or liberal title usage in business circles.Just behind, Sweden registered similar behavior, with about 71,000 professionals—roughly one in every 23—tagged under the executive tier. Spain stood next in line, where more than 150,000 users listed themselves as company heads, comprising just over 4% of its total LinkedIn crowd.Germany, despite topping the chart in volume, held the fourth spot by percentage. Out of 4.42 million LinkedIn profiles there, 185,000 identify as company leaders. That makes the ratio slightly less intense than in neighboring countries.Denmark, with its comparatively modest LinkedIn population, saw around 43,000 listings for chief executive roles, earning it a spot in the top five. The frequency—just under 4%—reflects a high saturation of leadership identifiers.Poland followed with a 3% share, translating to over 50,000 users labeling themselves as CEOs. While the total isn’t among the highest, the relative density suggests an active trend of status signaling or title normalization among digital professionals.Further down the list, Belgium saw under 3% of its members opting for the CEO descriptor. Though the proportion is smaller, it still outranks several larger nations. Italy, despite having four million users, showed a lower percentage—less than 3% of its profiles declared a chief executive role.The Netherlands, often noted for egalitarian corporate norms, posted a comparatively reserved rate. Roughly 2.26% of profiles used the CEO tag, pointing to a culture less inclined to formal executive labels.France, despite leading the group in total LinkedIn users, trailed at the bottom. Only 1.76% of French professionals claimed the CEO title—roughly one in 57—marking it the most conservative among the ten nations surveyed.\"LinkedIn has evolved from just a job board to a key platform for showing off our professional identities. The way we present ourselves, particularly through our job titles, reflects interesting cultural views on leadership and success. The title of CEO now focuses more on how we wish to be seen by others rather than just our role in a company. These cultural variations in personal branding are very important as companies work globally and base hiring choices on online impressions.\", Tabi Vicuña, Founder of Heepsy, commented on the study.Also read: Study Warns of Surge in Security Breaches Linked to Social Media ImpostorsOutside Europe, the trend continues with wide disparities. The United States, home to the world’s largest LinkedIn population at 236 million, recorded just over 2.4 million self-labeled CEOs—around 1.03%. Canada followed a similar pattern, with 180,000 out of 26 million users claiming the executive tag, marking a modest 0.69% share. In contrast, South Korea posted a higher percentage at 1.66%, translating to 72,000 CEO profiles from a pool of 4.3 million. Nigeria stood out among African nations, with 146,000 CEO claims across 10.3 million accounts—about 1.42%—surpassing even Japan’s 1.24% figure.Elsewhere, emerging economies displayed varying levels of title adoption. Ghana logged a 1.13% CEO density, while Kenya (0.61%), South Africa (0.55%), and Egypt (0.32%) showed more tempered behavior. Southeast Asia reflected cautious usage overall. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia all reported CEO listings below 0.4%, despite collectively hosting tens of millions of users. India, despite being the second-largest LinkedIn market with over 135 million members, registered only 415,000 CEO-tagged profiles—amounting to 0.31%.Latin America showed similar restraint. Brazil, with 71 million users, saw just 283,000 CEO entries, or 0.40%. Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina each fell below the 0.4% mark as well. European outliers like the United Kingdom (0.65%), the Netherlands (2.26%), and Italy (2.68%) offer contrast to places such as Qatar (0.34%), Jordan (0.31%), and Turkey (0.29%), where the label remains less saturated.Taken together, the figures reflect more than just professional labels—they expose how digital economies shape perception, branding, and hierarchy. In regions with a growing startup presence or weaker gatekeeping of executive roles, the CEO title may serve more as a positioning tactic than a reflection of organizational structure. As professional networks expand their global reach, such variations raise questions about the consistency and meaning of executive identity in the online space.

Only countries with at least one million LinkedIn users were included, filtering for platforms with sufficient traction to offer meaningful data. For each country, researchers examined three primary inputs, that is, the total number of LinkedIn users, the count of those who list “CEO” within their job titles, and the percentage this group represents out of the total user base.This percentage, not the absolute count, determined the rankings. By focusing on proportional representation, the study aimed to uncover not just where executives are found in volume, but where the title appears most densely. The intent was to capture regions where leadership is most prominently self-declared, suggesting localized trends in entrepreneurial culture, title inflation, or digital brand positioning.All figures were drawn from publicly available 2024 LinkedIn data and reviewed to ensure consistency across markets. The final dataset includes only those nations with verified, complete information—ensuring that the leaderboard reflects not popularity alone, but patterns of perceived authority within the global professional space.Read next: Apple Study Questions AI Reasoning Models in Stark New Report",

OpenAI reportedly reached $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up 82% from $5.5 billion in 2024. [contact-form-7] The $10 billion encompasses the artificial intelligence company’s consumer products and business products but excludes its licensing revenue from Microsoft and large on-time deals, CNBC reported Monday (June 9), citing an OpenAI spokesperson. While OpenAI sales are growing, so are its costs. The company lost about $5 billion in 2024, according to the report. It was reported Wednesday (June 4) that OpenAI said it added 1 million paying business subscribers since February, lifting the total number of such subscribers from 2 million in February to 3 million today. OpenAI rolled out the first of its business products in August 2023 and gained its first 1 million paying business subscribers over the next year, by September 2024. The adoption of OpenAI’s products has grown among other sorts of users as well. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in April that the company reached about 800 million people and that its user base had doubled in a matter of weeks. The company continued its push to deepen enterprise adoption of its business tools last week with its unveiling of two new business features for ChatGPT. One new feature, Connectors, lets ChatGPT connect to different apps used by office workers so it can access proprietary information in the user’s own computers and craft responses accordingly. The other, Record Mode, records and transcribes meeting conversations, generates structured summaries and recalls notes from past meetings. Chief financial officers of U.S. companies with more than $1 billion in revenue are adopting generative AI to improve efficiency, decision making and operations, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “The CAIO Report.” The report found that the share of these CFOs who reported a “very positive” return on investment from the technology leaped from 26% in March 2024 to nearly 90% in December. Tuesday’s CNBC report said the latest ARR figure explains the valuation OpenAI gained in a $40 billion funding round in March. The company is now valued at about 30 times its revenue, signaling its investors’ “hyper-growth expectations,” the report said. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Dutch and Iranian security researchers have created an automated genAI tool that can scan huge open source repositories and patch vulnerable code that could compromise applications. Tested by scanning GitHub for a particular path traversal vulnerability in Node.js projects that’s been around since 2010, the tool identified 1,756 vulnerable projects, some described as “very influential,” and led to 63 projects being patched so far. The tool opens the possibility for genAI platforms like ChatGPT to automatically create and distribute patches in code repositories, dramatically increasing the security of open source applications. But the research, described in a recently published paper, also points to a serious limitation in the use of AI that will need to be fixed for this solution to be effective. While automated patching by a large language model (LLM) dramatically improves scalability, the patch also might introduce other bugs.",

        "description": "The letter is modeled after the NIH director's controversial \"Great Barrington Declaration.\" Over 300 researchers from the National Institutes of Health have published a letter rebuking its director and the Trump administration for deep, politically motivated cuts to research funding, as well as disrupting global collaboration, undermining scientific review processes, and laying off critical NIH staff. \"We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\" the letter states, linking to independent news reports on the harms of NIH trials being halted and that the administration's cuts to the agency have cost, rather than saved, taxpayer money. Since January, the Trump administration has terminated 2,100 NIH research grants totaling around $9.5 billion and $2.6 billion in contracts, the letter notes. The researchers also accuse the administration of creating \"a culture of fear and suppression\" among federal researchers. The letter describes the researchers' action as \"dissent\" from the administration's policies, quoting NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya in his congressional confirmation hearing as saying, \"Dissent is the very essence of science.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Courtesy of Lyft, Ava Horton/BIDavid Risher, the CEO of Lyft, started his career at Microsoft and helped Jeff Bezos expand Amazon.Since starting as CEO of Lyft in 2023, he has biked to work in the office four days a week.His daily routine includes lots of meetings, an afternoon matcha break, and the occasional Lyft drive.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Risher, the 59-year-old CEO of Lyft based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.After I joined the board of Lyft four years ago, I was asked to apply to be CEO. At first, I said no, but the more I thought about it, the more excited I got.I wanted to bring the competitive spirit I learned at Microsoft, where I'd started my career and the customer obsession I'd learned from working with Jeff Bezos at Amazon, where I was a VP of product development. I also wanted to bring in the leading with purpose I enjoy at World Reader, a nonprofit I started that gets kids reading worldwide.Now, 36 years after starting my career, I'm the CEO of Lyft. Here's a typical day in my life.I wake up at 7 a.m. every morningI'm a morning person, but not too early. After I brush my teeth and wash my face, I check my Oura ring to get a report on how well I slept. I aim for seven hours of sleep each night.I exercise for about fifteen minutes at home every morning, typically stretching.I'm addicted to coffee, so I always have a cup in the morning. I'm on team Nespresso and am always looking for my perfect capsule.I then sit down with my phone but don't check my email first. I read The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post daily.Sometimes, I'll play a word game, such as Spelling Bee, to wake up. I then get to email and Slack and make sure nothing has happened overnight that I have to get to right away.I'm a gut health guy, so I eat yogurt and granola for breakfast. I don't want to brag, but I make my own granola.Usually, I'm out the door by 8:30. BI's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday.

I ride a Lyft bike to the office every day; it takes 21 minutes from my homeDavid Risher.Courtesy of LyftAs I bike to work, I count the number of times I see a Waymo or a Zoox in San Francisco to see how they're growing. On my way to the office, I pick up a second coffee.I go into the office four days a week. Three days in the office is the official policy, but I like going to work and bumping into people.The first meeting of my day is a stand-up meeting, which typically lasts about half an hour, with my chief of staff and my administrative assistant. We map out the day and plan ahead.I then meet with all of my direct reports for about three hours to discuss any issues facing the company or opportunities.Some days are more operational, and there are some days when most meetings are product review meetings, where we're discussing the next version of things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, or the driver earnings guarantee.My happy place is at the whiteboard with a team trying to figure out cool new innovations or customer-obsessed ideas. A lot of my job is getting people to say yes to things that might be slightly bolder than they're thinking.I typically have lunch in the officeI take a 20-minute lunch. Half the time, I eat alone and work on something, and the other half, I work or meet with staff and other employees. I think it may be terrifying when I sit down at the table and say to our team as the CEO, \"Can I join you?\"Every day, I go for a half-hour walk and get an iced matcha. Sometimes, I'll do a one-on-one with a team member as we walk because getting out of the office makes for a different conversation.Risher getting his afternoon matcha.Courtesy of LyftPart two of our stand-up meeting is held with my chief of staff around 5:30 p.m. I leave the office around 6:30 p.m. and walk. I'll take a call or listen to a podcast and bike home the rest of the way.I have a goal of living to 100, so I walk, bike, get good sleep, have good relationships, and do daily activities. I go to the gym or a dojo twice a week in the evenings and bicycle on the weekends to keep my body active.About every six weeks, I drive for LyftRisher driving for Lyft.Courtesy of LyftI drive to learn about what our riders are going through when they get in the car and why our customers choose us over the other guys. I always love it when they say, \"You guys are better; you have a better level of service.\" That's what we aim for, so that's amazing.I don't tell the rider who I am until the end. There was a time I picked up a Lyft employee on her way to work, and she recognized me, but most riders don't know until I tell them, and they'll go bananas.I have two daughters, but they're both older, and they live in ManhattanMy wife, Jennifer, and I live on the West Coast. Jennifer is an author and a speaker. She travels often, but we have dinner together when we're both home.She almost always cooks; I like cooking, but she's much better than I am. My job is to clean up the kitchen and leave it spotless.After dinner, we both get on email for another 45 minutes. I try not to send too many emails after hours, but sometimes my ideas excite me.We like to watch streaming series. We're finishing up season two of the Diplomat.We're also big readers. As my wind-down routine, I read for at least half an hour before going to bed. I just read \"Character Limit,\" a book about Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, and I'm in the middle of \"The Anxious Generation.\"After reading, I try to turn off the lights by about 11 p.m. I'm successful unless my wife and I go out or do something special.Read the original article on Business Insider Courtesy of Lyft, Ava Horton/BIDavid Risher, the CEO of Lyft, started his career at Microsoft and helped Jeff Bezos expand Amazon.Since starting as CEO of Lyft in 2023, he has biked to work in the office four days a week.His daily routine includes lots of meetings, an afternoon matcha break, and the occasional Lyft drive.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Risher, the 59-year-old CEO of Lyft based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.After I joined the board of Lyft four years ago, I was asked to apply to be CEO. At first, I said no, but the more I thought about it, the more excited I got.I wanted to bring the competitive spirit I learned at Microsoft, where I'd started my career and the customer obsession I'd learned from working with Jeff Bezos at Amazon, where I was a VP of product development. I also wanted to bring in the leading with purpose I enjoy at World Reader, a nonprofit I started that gets kids reading worldwide.Now, 36 years after starting my career, I'm the CEO of Lyft. Here's a typical day in my life.I wake up at 7 a.m. every morningI'm a morning person, but not too early. After I brush my teeth and wash my face, I check my Oura ring to get a report on how well I slept. I aim for seven hours of sleep each night.I exercise for about fifteen minutes at home every morning, typically stretching.I'm addicted to coffee, so I always have a cup in the morning. I'm on team Nespresso and am always looking for my perfect capsule.I then sit down with my phone but don't check my email first. I read The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post daily.Sometimes, I'll play a word game, such as Spelling Bee, to wake up. I then get to email and Slack and make sure nothing has happened overnight that I have to get to right away.I'm a gut health guy, so I eat yogurt and granola for breakfast. I don't want to brag, but I make my own granola.Usually, I'm out the door by 8:30. BI's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday.

Microsoft is planning to rank artificial intelligence (AI) models based on safety. [contact-form-7] This effort is part of the tech giant’s effort to foster trust among its cloud customers as it sells them AI products from companies like OpenAI and xAI, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (June 8). Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s head of Responsible AI, told the FT the company would soon add a “safety” category to its “model leaderboard,” a feature it created recently for developers to rank iterations from providers including China’s DeepSeek and France’s Mistral. The leaderboard, which is accessible to clients using the Azure Foundry developer platform, is expected to influence which AI models and applications are purchased via Microsoft. Microsoft ranks three metrics: quality, cost and throughput, which is how fast a model can generate an output. Bird said the new safety ranking would make sure “people can just directly shop and understand” AI models’ capabilities as they determine which to purchase. The decision to offer safety benchmarks comes as Microsoft’s customers wrestle with the potential risks posed by new AI models to data and privacy protections, especially when deployed as autonomous “agents” that can function with no human supervision. Rankings let users access objective metrics when choosing from a catalogue of more than 1,900 AI models, allowing them to make an informed choice of which to use. “Safety leader boards can help businesses cut through the noise and narrow down options,” Cassie Kozyrkov, a consultant and former chief decision scientist at Google, told the FT. “The real challenge is understanding the trade-offs: higher performance at what cost? Lower cost at what risk?” In other AI news, PYMNTS recently examined the use of AI agents in banking compliance in an interview with Greenlite AI CEO Will Lawrence. He told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster that while the 2000s were defined by rule-based systems and the 2010s ushered in machine learning, the 2020s are “the agentic era of compliance.” The shift, that report said, has a range of implications. Trust is key for regulated financial institutions. Mistakes lead to declined transactions and also risk regulatory exposure. “Right now, banks are getting more risk signals than they can investigate,” Lawrence said. “Digital accounts are growing. Backlogs are growing. Detection isn’t the problem anymore — it’s what to do next.” “AI is only scary until you understand how it works,” Lawrence added. “Then it’s just a tool — like a calculator. We’re helping banks understand how to use it safely.” The post Microsoft Plans to Rank AI Models by Safety appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Bespoke handheld interface hides the desktop while offering access to \"all Windows games.\" Back in March, we outlined six features we wanted to see on what was then just a rumored Xbox-branded, Windows-powered handheld gaming device. Today, Microsoft's announcement of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally hardware line looks like it fulfills almost all of our wishes for Microsoft's biggest foray into portable gaming yet. The Windows-11 powered Xbox Ally devices promise access to \"all of the games available on Windows,\" including \"games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net, and other leading PC storefronts [read: Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, etc].\" But instead of having to install and boot up those games through the stock Windows interface, as you often do on handhelds like the original ROG Ally line, all these games will be available through what Microsoft is calling an \"aggregated gaming library.\" Microsoft promises an \"integrated library\" can be used to access Windows games across a variety of launchers. Credit: Microsoft A tap of the Xbox button brings up the Game Bar for quick access to many functions and settings. Credit: Microsoft Asus and Microsoft are stressing how that integrated experience can be used with games across multiple different Windows-based launchers, promising \"access to games to can't get elsewhere.\" That could be seen as a subtle dig at SteamOS-powered devices like the Steam Deck which can have significant trouble with certain titles that don't play well with Steam and/or Linux for one reason or another. Microsoft also highlights how support apps like Discord, Twitch, and downloadable game mods will also be directly available via the Xbox Ally's Windows backbone.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "A LinkedIn executive (not pictured) shared how young people can boost their career prospects in a tough job market.Jacques Julien/Getty ImagesSome recent college graduates are struggling to find work as businesses scale back hiring.Writing a \"story of self\" that helps define your unique skills can help, a LinkedIn executive said.Becoming \"AI literate\" is a must for young people navigating the changing economy, he said.LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer is familiar with the challenges facing job seekers, from slower hiring to AI, but he also sees opportunity.Aneesh Raman told Business Insider that he believes job seekers can build meaningful careers by identifying their strengths, continuing to learn, and creating what he calls a \"story of self.\"This is especially important for young people. In the New York Fed's analysis of 35 years of jobs data, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 hasn't exceeded the broader US jobless rate by as much as it did in March, the most recent month available: 5.8% of recent graduates were unemployed, compared with 4% of workforce ages 16 to 65.However, recent grads aren't the only ones struggling to find work. Excluding a brief pandemic-related dip, US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2013, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but for many who need a job, the market is considerably tougher than it was a few years ago.I asked Raman about these challenges and what job seekers can do to stand out. Below are edited excerpts from our conversation.What advice would you give to young people who are struggling to find work and want to set themselves up for future career success?I think the most important, difficult, and exciting task that entry-level workers should start with is to define their story of self. What are the skills that you uniquely have and that you've built across lived and learned experience?The second step is to learn something every day. That starts with AI. What are the tools? How do you use them? How are you using them in service of the skills that you've got, in service of the expertise you want to build? But over time, that learning is going to be around these core curiosities that are going to drive what you do in your job. And so starting to make all of that part of your daily habit of how you're going to build your career, it's going to pay off big time.I've lived this story. My career makes absolutely no sense by job title, and that was a hard thing at times, where I had this really interesting but squiggly-line career that made it really hard for people to know what I could come into that organization and do better than anyone else. But when I looked at it as a skillset across all my jobs, from war reporter to Obama speech writer to working at Facebook, to here, explanatory storytelling has been core from the start.Now I have a job that is uniquely the sort of role for me to play at LinkedIn at this time. And I think that's what folks should start thinking about. How do you build a career that is building toward a job that you can do better than anyone else, based on these core things you're learning that are unique to your skills and expertise?Aneesh Raman says entry-level workers can benefit from defining their \"story of self\" and continuing to learn.Aneesh RamanCan you share more about what it means to define your \"story of self\"?It actually starts with having a good pitch for yourself, not for an employer: having a story of self that you are excited about, that is based on skills that you might not even recognize are these great superpowers you have, and that you should really be building your career around. Storytelling for me was not a skillset that I self-identified with until very recently, and now it's core to how I understand my ability to do something that the world values and needs.So you have to come to a story of self that you're excited about, and if you're excited about it, that excitement is going to come across in every interview you do. And it's going to make you more desirable as an applicant because you're going to bring this sort of energy and conviction about what you want to do in that role with those skills and that expertise, including a desire to learn and a desire to grow that is going to just make you stand out. Have you landed a new job in the last few years and are open to sharing your story? Please fill out this quick Google Form.Struggling to find work? Please fill out this Google Form. Do you think the adoption of AI is making it harder for young people to find jobs?I think right now, in many ways, it is the best of times and the worst of times to be entering the workforce. There is a great deal of uncertainty across companies about how to adopt AI, and a growing focus on the tasks of entry-level work as one place where AI is able to help deliver more and more quickly. We know that job seekers are hearing less than they want from recruiters.But what I want entry-level workers to know is that there are also all these signs that it is the best of times to be early in your career. I think you're going to have more and more people moving jobs within companies where they're getting greater ability to learn and grow and do more interesting work more quickly than the old world of work would've allowed.We're also going to see career planning change. There will be a lot more agency for individuals to build their careers in their twenties around the skills and behaviors they want to hone.And that means as you get further in your career in your forties, you're going to have much more ability to define for yourself what impact you want to have with the job, where you want to work, and that's something that's new. The ability to really build a career on your terms is new, and it's just starting.I think the future of work is going to be one where no one beats you at being you, and that's exciting. It's also new, and so everyone's going to have to figure out their way to define what it is about them that no one can beat them at, that they can build a career around.How much of young people's job search struggles can be explained by economic conditions that might improve?I think work is going to change for everyone, no matter what the quarterly or annual atmospherics are around the economy. We're entering a new economy. The knowledge economy that we've lived in for about half a century is on the way out. The new \"it\" skills, the new hard skills, are the non-technical skills — the unique capabilities we have as humans. We know that people skills are becoming more and more core to how people are getting hired and promoted, including software engineers. It's going to affect every sector at work.How can employers and educational institutions better collaborate to prepare young workers for roles that AI can't easily replace?I think the most important thing for anyone who can affect the systems that surround work is to be pro-human. And it's important for me to start there because nothing about the story of work has really been a story of humans at work. It's always been a story of technology at work. And so all the systems that surround work, from education to employment to entrepreneurship, have been built around a diminished role of humans at work and increasing productivity and efficiency.I think being pro-human means redesigning these systems with two goals in mind. The first is to help every worker become AI literate. Everyone at every stage of their career should be asking their company and their employers to help them get more familiar with AI tools and become better at using them. So that's one area of focus that I think employers and educators should be urgently focused on.The second one is helping everyone become an entrepreneur. And that doesn't mean you have to go launch a business: It just means we all have to become more entrepreneurial as humans at work. And so that is a mix of the curiosity, creativity, and compassion that go into coming up with new ideas and working with others to refine them. It includes behaviors like resilience, adaptability, and developing conviction that you see a lot of entrepreneurs have to hold true to.I think the most important thing for any young worker is to both acknowledge the difficulty of this moment, but to push past the fear and really start to figure out how you want to build this career that earlier generations of workers could never have imagined. Being able to just build the career they want, AI's ability to help you learn and grow, and AI's ability to help you build and scale products and businesses. This is a different moment than any other generation has had going into work. So make sure you're seeing that as much as you're managing the day-to-day difficulty of the job market right now.Read the original article on Business Insider A LinkedIn executive (not pictured) shared how young people can boost their career prospects in a tough job market.Jacques Julien/Getty ImagesSome recent college graduates are struggling to find work as businesses scale back hiring.Writing a \"story of self\" that helps define your unique skills can help, a LinkedIn executive said.Becoming \"AI literate\" is a must for young people navigating the changing economy, he said.LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer is familiar with the challenges facing job seekers, from slower hiring to AI, but he also sees opportunity.Aneesh Raman told Business Insider that he believes job seekers can build meaningful careers by identifying their strengths, continuing to learn, and creating what he calls a \"story of self.\"This is especially important for young people.

[…] The post OpenAI Gives ChatGPT More Business Features appeared first on PYMNTS.com. OpenAI has unveiled two new business features for ChatGPT in its latest push to deepen enterprise adoption and challenge Microsoft and Google’s office productivity products. [contact-form-7] The first is called “Connectors,” and it lets ChatGPT connect to different apps used by office workers, including Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, Teams, Dropbox, GitHub, HubSpot, SharePoint and more. That means ChatGPT can now access proprietary information in the user’s own computers and craft responses accordingly. This integration can transform the way users search, plan and collaborate in real time. An example from OpenAI in a product demo was this prompt: “Get me up to speed on our Q2 marketing and product strategy. What features drove the most revenue in Q2?” To use Connectors, users must manually connect ChatGPT to the apps. To do so, go to your profile on ChatGPT. Click on settings and then Connectors. Connect to the applications available. (Some apps may need your administrator’s approval.) Connectors is rolling out this week for Plus, Pro, Teams, Enterprise and Education subscribers. The second feature is “Record Mode.” It records and transcribes meeting conversations. It also automatically generates structured summaries that include action items and time-stamped citations. ChatGPT can also recall notes from past meetings. This turns ChatGPT into what OpenAI called a “second memory,” capable of recalling discussions, surfacing decisions and even drafting follow-up documents based on spoken content. ChatGPT can turn summaries or transcripts into emails, project plans or even code. The feature can be accessed through a circle next to the microphone icon. This feature is now live for Teams subscribers, with access for enterprise and education subscribers coming soon. These features signal OpenAI’s intent to expand ChatGPT into a comprehensive enterprise productivity suite — directly competing with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. “ChatGPT doesn’t want to be a tool you switch to, but a surface you operate from,” said Saanya Ojha, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, in a LinkedIn post. “Although Microsoft is a key OpenAI partner, Copilot and ChatGPT are starting to collide. Features like transcription, research, and action items overlap with Copilot for Microsoft 365.” Unlike those offerings, which are tightly integrated into their respective ecosystems, OpenAI’s approach emphasizes interoperability across platforms and data sources. OpenAI emphasized that all connectors and data queries respect existing user permissions.

        "description": "Large language models have become eerily good at sounding human. That’s not new. But there’s a deeper issue gaining attention i.e. when these models explain their answers, can we actually trust what they say? Researchers at Microsoft and MIT's CSAIL think we need better tools for answering that question. They’ve come up with a new way to test whether AI explanations really reflect the decision-making that led to a given output—or if the model is just giving a polished, plausible-sounding excuse. This matters. A lot. If an AI makes decisions based on biased or irrelevant factors, but then justifies itself with something reasonable, people may believe it's being fair or accurate. And they may not think to question it—especially in places like hiring, medicine, or legal work, where stakes are high. One troubling case: a well-known model ranked female nursing candidates higher than male ones, even when the only change was the gender listed. Yet when asked to explain, it pointed to skills and experience, not gender. That’s a textbook case of an “unfaithful” explanation—the logic doesn’t match the answer. To make this easier to catch, the team developed what they call causal concept faithfulness. It’s a mouthful, but the idea is simple: check if the concepts the AI says influenced its answer are the ones that actually mattered. How do you test that? First, you need to know what concepts are in the question. For that, the researchers used a second AI model—basically a helper—to pull out the key ideas. Then, they changed those ideas one by one and fed the altered questions back to the original model. If the answer changes, you’ve got evidence that the concept was causally important. If the model didn’t mention that concept in its explanation? It’s hiding something. This kind of testing doesn’t come cheap. You need lots of examples and lots of back-and-forth testing with the models, which racks up computing time. To make it manageable, the team used a statistical shortcut—a Bayesian hierarchical model—to estimate multiple effects at once rather than testing each in isolation. In practice, the method uncovered some uncomfortable patterns. On a dataset designed to test for social bias, language models sometimes made decisions that clearly leaned on race, gender, or income—but then claimed otherwise, pointing to other attributes like personality or behavior. In another dataset based on patient care, explanations left out crucial medical details that had clearly influenced the outcome. It’s not a perfect system. The helper model that identifies and edits concepts can slip up, and it’s still hard to untangle concepts that appear together often. The researchers say future versions might experiment with adjusting multiple inputs at once. But even with those limits, the method gives developers and users a powerful tool: the ability to see when AI is presenting a clean narrative that doesn’t line up with what’s actually under the hood. That opens the door to targeted fixes. If you know a model is quietly favoring one gender, you can stop using it for comparisons—or go in and fix the bias directly. In the long run, tools like this may be critical for building AI systems that people can actually trust—not because they sound smart, but because their reasoning holds up when tested.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Study Warns of Surge in Security Breaches Linked to Social Media Impostors",

Amazon said Wednesday (June 4) that its latest artificial intelligence (AI) projects are related to robots, last-mile delivery and supply chain optimization. [contact-form-7] The company highlighted these efforts in a Wednesday post on LinkedIn. In the case of robots, Amazon said its agentic AI team is developing an AI foundation model framework that will allow robots like the company’s Proteus to “understand natural language commands, reason about them, and act autonomously.” For last-mile delivery, Amazon announced an initiative called Wellspring that aims to “dramatically improve precision of deliveries and the driver experience through the use of generative AI.” The company also unveiled the latest AI foundation model powering its Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT), according to the post. “This model processes over 400 million items across 270 different time spans, fundamentally changing how the company forecasts and positions inventory in ways that benefit price, selection and convenience for customers,” the post said. CNBC reported Wednesday that the agentic AI team working on the AI foundation model framework for robots is a new group within Amazon’s Lab126 hardware research-and-development unit, which created the Kindle, Echo and other devices. Reuters reported Wednesday that Amazon is using generative AI to create more advanced maps that help its drivers make deliveries in challenging locations like large office complexes, apartment complexes and housing developments. The firm also plans to use AI to predict customer demand for products based on price, convenience, weather and sales, thereby helping Amazon more efficiently cater to its customers, according to the Reuters report. These reports follow some other recent announcements of AI-powered solutions from Amazon. On March 31, the company launched an AI agent that can use a web browser to do things like shop for products and services on behalf of users. Call Nova Act, the AI agent can navigate, interact with and act on web content without constant human oversight. In November, Amazon Web Services announced the Generative AI Partner Alliance, which is designed to give customers access to a network of systems experts and consulting firms to help them deploy generative AI solutions. Amazon Ads debuted two AI tools in October, saying they are designed to help advertisers expand their reach by creating “engaging content across media types.” The post Amazon Aims to Use AI to Help Robots Understand Natural Language Commands appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, said he expects the role of middle managers to change significantly in the years to come.Aneesh RamanCompanies are cutting middle managers in pursuit of efficiency.Those who remain will see an evolution in the role in the coming years, a LinkedIn executive said.He said these changes could provide career opportunities for Gen Zers and millennials.Some companies are cutting middle management positions, and the roles that remain could change significantly in the years ahead.Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, believes AI adoption — and the broader economic transformation he expects it to drive — will fundamentally change what it means to be a middle manager over the next decade.In addition, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans this year to collectively lay off thousands of workers, many of them managers. These cuts to midlevel roles are part of a trend some have dubbed the \"Great Flattening,\" and reflect a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. At the same time, companies are grappling with the rise of AI tools and how they might reshape their operations and workforces.I asked Raman which management skills he thinks will be most critical going forward — and how millennials, many of whom are now in management roles, might navigate their next career challenge: adapting to the evolving role of middle managers. Below are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. How has this 'great flattening' trend affected middle managers?We're entering a new world of work. Every job is going to look different in five to 10 years.It's not going to play out in the same way everywhere on the same timeline, but I think every company is trying to figure out how to build organizations that are able to adapt more than we have before — organizations that are less hierarchical and built more around projects.One of the biggest things that's going to look and feel different in five to 10 years is what it means to be a middle manager in the knowledge economy. The job of the manager was to manage the tasks of the people they managed. The role of the manager in this new economy is to be a coach.Managers are going to have to think about managing people — not the tasks of people, but the energy of people. How to make sure you've got teams that have psychological safety to test, and try, and fail in the service of building new things. How you're being mindful of where people's skillset and energy are best used in the course of a project as it gets built. It's a whole different way to manage than the old way.You said you think every job will be different in a decade. What forces do you think will drive this change?Over the past few years, we've seen change come in waves: remote work, shifting generational values, and rising worker expectations. But AI is different. It's a force, alongside breakthroughs in robotics and quantum computing, that's reshaping every job, in every sector, all at once.Over the next decade, AI will be the single biggest driver of work transformation and one of the most profound shifts the labor market has ever seen. We have a window right now to shape that shift — to make work more human, not less — but only if we act with urgency and intention.What about the changing economy do you think will make managing people, rather than just tasks, particularly important?The reason I think the role of manager is going to change is the same reason I think we're entering a new economy, which is that the role of humans at work is going to be more about coming up with new ideas, coming up with new inventions, coming up with new ways of work as an employee or new businesses as an entrepreneur. That's going to be what will make work linger for humans.In that world, if you're a manager at a company, you're trying to create the best environment for people to imagine and invent, and that's a different set of tasks than in the previous economy of just tracking people's tasks and making sure those tasks were moving forward.The Great Recession and the pandemic both disrupted the careers of millennials, many of whom have transitioned into management roles in recent years. Is the \"great flattening\" one more setback for the millennial career path?I think every single person is having their career clock reset right now. Everyone's job is changing on them, even if they aren't changing jobs, and everyone's career trajectory is changing on them, even if they have no plans to change their career trajectory.That is something that people can approach with anxiety and fear, because we're biologically wired to be anxious and fearful of change, or it can be something that people see opportunity in so that they can start driving their career and their job in ways that give them more agency and more unique contribution than ever before.If I look at millennials and Gen Z, they have the \"it\" credential right now. They have resilience that is undoubtedly part of how those generations have approached work. They have an adaptability that they've had no choice but to learn, given all the atmospherics that they've had to contend with. Those are really important behaviors that everyone is going to want in their organization.If you can start by thinking about \"What are my strengths?' And then, \"How do I want to apply those strengths to the job I want to create, the career I want to build?\" There's a great deal of opportunity for people to figure out how they want to lean into that change.I try to remind people: Remember the early nineties, when no one was quite sure what was coming with the internet and the knowledge economy? Well, imagine if you could go back then and you knew everything that was going to come. What would you do? There are a bunch of opportunities to completely change the trajectory of your career.I encourage people to think about understanding their strengths, including strengths like resilience and adaptability, and then figuring out how they want to maximize the opportunity that's coming as everything gets remade.Do you have a story to share? Reach out to this reporter at jzinkula@businessinsider.com.Read the original article on Business Insider Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, said he expects the role of middle managers to change significantly in the years to come.Aneesh RamanCompanies are cutting middle managers in pursuit of efficiency.Those who remain will see an evolution in the role in the coming years, a LinkedIn executive said.He said these changes could provide career opportunities for Gen Zers and millennials.Some companies are cutting middle management positions, and the roles that remain could change significantly in the years ahead.Aneesh Raman, LinkedIn's chief economic opportunity officer, believes AI adoption — and the broader economic transformation he expects it to drive — will fundamentally change what it means to be a middle manager over the next decade.In addition, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans this year to collectively lay off thousands of workers, many of them managers. These cuts to midlevel roles are part of a trend some have dubbed the \"Great Flattening,\" and reflect a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. At the same time, companies are grappling with the rise of AI tools and how they might reshape their operations and workforces.I asked Raman which management skills he thinks will be most critical going forward — and how millennials, many of whom are now in management roles, might navigate their next career challenge: adapting to the evolving role of middle managers. Below are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. How has this 'great flattening' trend affected middle managers?We're entering a new world of work. Every job is going to look different in five to 10 years.It's not going to play out in the same way everywhere on the same timeline, but I think every company is trying to figure out how to build organizations that are able to adapt more than we have before — organizations that are less hierarchical and built more around projects.One of the biggest things that's going to look and feel different in five to 10 years is what it means to be a middle manager in the knowledge economy. The job of the manager was to manage the tasks of the people they managed. The role of the manager in this new economy is to be a coach.Managers are going to have to think about managing people — not the tasks of people, but the energy of people. How to make sure you've got teams that have psychological safety to test, and try, and fail in the service of building new things. How you're being mindful of where people's skillset and energy are best used in the course of a project as it gets built.

Nvidia now boasts a market cap of $3.444 trillion, edging out Microsoft's $3.441 trillion based on data from Nasdaq.The last time Nvidia held the top spot was on January 24. Since last June, it has been competing with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the top market cap company.The rise in Nvidia's value came a week after the company reported Q1 revenues that beat Wall Street expectations at $44.06 billion, which makes for a 69% year-over-year increase.Confidence in Nvidia remains high despite the company expecting to lose $8 billion in revenue over the next quarter due to the Trump administration's new chip export control policies, which prevented it from selling its H20 chips developed specifically for China's market.Huang has expressed dissatisfaction over chip controls during the earnings call and in media appearances that followed.\"On export control, China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success.

        "description": "OpenAI’s video generation tool, Sora, is now available for free to anyone using the Bing mobile app, following a quiet but significant rollout by Microsoft. The feature, called Bing Video Creator, lets users type in a prompt and receive a short AI-generated video in return — without needing a paid subscription.Sora first drew attention in late 2024 for its ability to create surprisingly realistic and dynamic video clips from just text, but since then, other companies have launched their own tools, some offering longer clips or faster results. Despite this, Sora’s arrival on Bing opens the door for many more people to try the technology without paying for OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus or Pro plans.Using the tool is simple. After downloading the Bing app on iOS or Android, users can either tap “Video Creator” in the menu or just type a phrase like “create a video of…” into the search bar. Within seconds, the app generates a five-second vertical video clip based on the description. Videos can be shared, downloaded, or saved for later, and each user gets ten fast generations for free. After that, slower processing remains available at no cost, or users can use Microsoft Rewards points to unlock more fast ones.At the moment, videos are limited to five seconds and do not include sound. Horizontal video support is expected soon, but for now the clips are designed to suit platforms like TikTok or YouTube Shorts. The app doesn’t yet support full-length or stitched-together video sequences.Microsoft says the tool was built with safety in mind. Prompts that could result in harmful content are blocked automatically, and every video comes with built-in metadata that labels it as AI-generated.Although aimed at casual users, the release also reflects the growing interest in generative video across industries. Short clips created from text may soon find uses beyond entertainment, such as in education, marketing, or training materials.For now, the rollout is global, except in China and Russia. Desktop access and integration with Microsoft’s Copilot are also expected soon. For many users, this will be their first real hands-on experience with AI video — and with no cost to start, it marks a notable step in making the technology widely accessible.Read next: Executive Coaching Builds Confidence in Data-First Cultures",

        "description": "USB-C ports have always supported different capabilities on different systems. We've been covering the small, reversible USB Type-C connector since the days when it was just a USB Implementers Forum tech demo, and in the decade-plus since then, the port has gradually taken over the world. It gradually migrated from laptops to game consoles, to PC accessories, to Android phones, to e-readers, and to iPhones. Despite some hiccups and shortcomings, we're considerably closer to a single connector that does everything than we were a decade ago. But some of that confusion persists. A weakness built into the USB-C from the very beginning was that the specification for the physical connector was always separate from the specifications for the USB protocol itself (that is, the data transfer speed a given port is capable of), the USB Power Delivery specification for charging, and the USB-C Alt Mode specification for carrying non-USB signals like DisplayPort or HDMI. All of these specifications were frequently grouped together so that individual USB-C ports could handle charging, display output, and data transfers (or some combination of all three at once), but they weren't required to go together, so occasionally users will still run into physical USB-C ports that fall short of the port's do-everything promise.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "For many, the most challenging part of job hunting in 2025 isn’t the competition; it’s the silence. People are applying to more jobs than ever but hearing back less. When a response doesn’t come, it’s easy to feel defeated. You may even begin to suspect that the job was never real in the first place—and in some cases that’s true. In new LinkedIn research, nearly half of job seekers said that not hearing back when they apply to a job is a top pain point in their search, and most said the application process feels unclear. More than half of applicants reported hearing back from less than 5% of jobs they applied to, and 69% said the process lacks transparency. It’s not surprising, then, that the majority of job seekers are feeling stuck. When responses are rare, candidates increasingly question whether the jobs they’re applying to are even real. That’s where the term ghost jobs comes in. This expression has been growing in prominence in recent years, and we are seeing an increase in mentions of “ghosting” across LinkedIn as well. Ghost jobs are job listings that some companies post with no intention of hiring. More than a third of job seekers say ghost jobs are a major pain point. While ghost jobs are essentially fake job listings, we’ve seen job seekers assume the number of ghost jobs is growing because they’re not hearing back from the companies they are applying to. In reality, it’s not that straightforward, and part of what’s driving this perception is silence. When job seekers apply and never hear back, it’s easy to assume they’ve submitted to a ghost job. In today’s competitive market, it’s harder than ever for job seekers to tell what’s real, what’s active, and where time is best spent. But there are ways to decipher whether a job is real and improve your chances of landing the right role. Apply with more confidence First, make sure you’re doing your due diligence when it comes to vetting a job listing. Beware of any job posting that appears too good to be true, text messages offering job interviews, or listings that require payment up front. These are clues that the job may not be what it seems. At LinkedIn, we’ve recently added new hiring insights offering new details on job listings, such as a company’s typical response time and whether a job post is verified, so you can apply knowing information about the company or job poster has been confirmed. Build a trusted network One effective way to avoid silence in the job search is by leveraging referrals and recommendations from your network. When someone in your network refers you for a position, it can elevate your application. In a LinkedIn consumer survey from March, 93% of hiring managers said referrals are important because they come with a trusted recommendation. If you have a first- or second-degree connection at a company you’re interested in, don’t be afraid to reach out and ask if they can refer you for an open position. Share what you’re looking for You can also try posting proactively about what sort of opportunities you’re open to. Close to a third of professionals shared that posting to their network about what they’re looking for in a new role was helpful in making new connections or receiving introductions. Ghost jobs make the process harder, but there are ways to protect your time and focus on what’s real. Keep going. The right role is out there. And we are rooting for you.",

This week in artificial intelligence, newsmakers include Google, Claude, Microsoft, Nvidia and Saudi Arabia. Brands Must Lean Into AI Chatbots as Google Search Changes AI chatbots are transforming how search works, making traditional SEO tactics less effective. “It is fundamentally changing the search engine optimization (SEO) universe,” Local Falcon CEO David Hunter told PYMNTS in an interview. “It’s not just a little algorithm update… The concept of being visible in a search engine is changing dramatically.” In the past, businesses relied on keyword-rich pages and inbound links to rank. Now, Google’s large language models deliver results based on conversational context and user intent. Local Falcon’s research highlighted a change in how Google decides which businesses appear — and in what order — in search results. Anthropic’s Claude Gets Conversational Voice Anthropic’s Claude now lets users converse through voice, not just text, following in the footsteps of ChatGPT and Gemini. But unlike ChatGPT, Claude’s voice integrates with Google Workspace to access Calendar, Gmail and Docs. This lets Claude audibly tell users about upcoming meetings, emails and relevant news. The Workspace integration is for paid subscribers, with Docs accessibility for Enterprise plan users only. Gemini’s voice also offers integration with Workspace. Voice mode is available in English on Claude mobile apps. For free users, Claude has a daily limit of 20 to 30 voice messages. Paid plans have higher limits depending on the type of plan. Microsoft Offers AI Agent Marketplace for Business Microsoft launched the Agent Store, a marketplace where users can shop for AI agents tailored to specific tasks. “The Agent Store is your one-stop shop for the next generation of AI assistants,” wrote Principal Product Manager Siffat Hingorani and Senior Product Manager Olive Hu in a blog post. Integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, the store lets users “browse, install and try agents” from Microsoft, partners and customers. Unlike OpenAI’s GPT marketplace, Microsoft’s agents are embedded within the user’s work environment, with the user’s data as context. The store opened with over 70 agents, and developers can build and publish using Copilot Studio and the 365 Agents Toolkit. Nvidia Takes $4.5 Billion Charge for Chinese Chips Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an earnings call with analysts that the company took a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to excess inventory of the H20 chip that was specifically designed for China. However, a new rule required a license before the chip could be sold in the Chinese market. “We cannot further reduce the chip’s performance to stay within the regulations, so it is inventory we cannot sell or repurpose,” Huang said. Despite the China setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. It also beat Wall Street’s expectations for first-quarter earnings and revenue. Saudi Arabia Vies to Be Middle East’s AI Center Saudi Arabia’s new AI company, Humain, plans to launch a $10 billion venture fund targeting startups across the United States, Europe and Asia. It also seeks investments from top U.S. tech companies. CEO Tareq Amin told the Financial Times: “We are in discussions with all of them,” referring to talks with OpenAI, xAI and Andreessen Horowitz. “Some of them, which you will hear about very soon, are massive names in the data center segment.” Humain aims to build 1.9 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2030 and expand to 6.6 gigawatts by 2034. Amin said this would require a $77 billion investment. “The world is hungry for capacity,” Amin said. “There are two paths you could take. You take it slow, and we are definitely not taking it slow, or you go fast. Whoever reaches the end line first, I think, is going to secure a good chunk of the market share.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Inside the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence, one of Silicon Valley’s most influential voices is pushing back against a rising trend: machines marketed as emotional companions.Reid Hoffman, who helped launch LinkedIn and has since become a leading investor in AI startups, voiced serious concern this week over tech’s growing attempt to position chatbots as human-like friends. His warning came during a conversation on the Possible podcast, where he challenged both the concept and the consequences of calling AI systems “friends.”While several companies have begun embedding emotionally responsive bots into popular platforms, Hoffman argued that labeling them as friends distorts what friendship actually means — and chips away at how people understand real relationships.The timing of his remarks coincides with a broader push by Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, to integrate conversational AI into products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and even wearable devices like Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg recently framed AI companions as part of a solution to rising social isolation in the U.S., pointing to data showing that many Americans report having very few close friendships.Still, Hoffman pushed back, saying the language surrounding these tools matters more than companies are willing to admit. For him, the issue isn't whether a chatbot can be emotionally engaging — it's whether pretending it's a peer misleads people about what connection truly involves.In his view, a real friendship carries mutual responsibility and depth. A chatbot, no matter how advanced, lacks the ability to offer support in both directions. Hoffman emphasized that when one side in a relationship cannot grow, reflect, or hold the other accountable, calling it “friendship” undermines the human experience.Rather than eliminating the use of AI in personal spaces, Hoffman favors clear communication and design boundaries. He pointed to more cautious implementations, like Inflection AI’s Pi assistant, which identifies itself as a “companion,” not a friend, and actively encourages users to build stronger ties with people in their lives.As AI firms race to build tools that feel emotionally intelligent, Hoffman called for industry-wide norms and increased transparency around how these technologies are described and deployed. He urged companies, markets, and governments to step in before social definitions become permanently blurred.The stakes, in his view, go beyond marketing language. He believes that by confusing synthetic interactions with real relationships, society risks weakening the emotional fabric that supports personal growth and connection.Hoffman is not alone in voicing that concern. Earlier this month, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman addressed a similar issue during Senate testimony. Asked whether he’d be comfortable with his own child forming a deep attachment to an AI chatbot, Altman said no — arguing that while adults may seek comfort from machines, children need clearer boundaries and stronger safeguards.As AI tools become more lifelike and persistent, industry leaders are facing new pressure to draw ethical lines. For Hoffman, drawing that line at friendship is essential — not just for clarity, but for protecting what it means to live among and rely on real people.Read next: Apple’s App Store Tripled Revenue Since 2019, Now at $406B in U.S.",

Amazon’s devices unit is reportedly building a new team that is focused on inventing “breakthrough” consumer products and creating “entirely new product categories.” The ZeroOne team is led by Microsoft veteran J Allard, who helped create that company’s Xbox; has members in Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California; and includes staffers who were previously with Amazon’s business units that developed Alexa voice assistant, Luna cloud gaming service and Halo sleep tracker, CNBC reported Thursday (May 29). In job postings, Amazon has said that the team’s projects include a new smart home product, according to the report. “You’ll be part of a team that embraces design thinking, rapid experimentation, and building to learn,” one job posting said, per the report. “If you’re excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk with you.” An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Allard is overseeing ZeroOne, but did not provide details on the group’s work, according to the report. This report came about two weeks after Amazon cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. That unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Zoox robotaxi and Alexa. An Amazon spokesperson told Reuters at the time: “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” In February, Panos Panay, head of Amazon’s devices and services division, told CNN that the company is preparing to release a “constellation” of devices powered by artificial intelligence. “You can imagine … a constellation of devices that has to come together to make it a better experience,” Panay said. CNN reported that Panay didn’t say what devices might be included in that group. It added that Amazon has started to add AI to some of its devices, including Ring security cameras, Eero Wi-Fi routers and Echo smart speakers. The company also offers smart glasses, smart rings and fitness trackers. The post Amazon Building Team Focused on Creating ‘Entirely New Product Categories’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Microsoft has unveiled the Agent Store, a centralized marketplace where users can “shop” for AI agents tailored for specific tasks. Integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, the Agent Store serves both developers and non-technical users who want to use artificial intelligence (AI) agents to streamline workflows, automate tasks and enhance productivity across the workplace. “The Agent Store is your one-stop shop for the next generation of AI assistants,” Principal Product Manager Siffat Hingorani and Senior Product Manager Olive Hu wrote in a blog post. Through the marketplace, users can browse, install and try agents from Microsoft and its partners and customers. OpenAI has also introduced a similar marketplace for GPTs that offer bots designed to perform specific tasks. Users can pick from a selection of GPTs or make their own. What’s different between the two is that Microsoft’s agents are embedded within the user’s work environment, with the user’s data as context. OpenAI’s GPT marketplace offers more general tasks to the public. Microsoft’s Agent Store launched with more than 70 agents, which it said would grow over time. Developers can build their own agents and publish to the store using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit.

But unlike ChatGPT, Claude voice integrates with Google Workspace to access Calendar, Gmail and Docs so it can do such things as audibly tell users about upcoming meetings, important emails and relevant news. The Workspace integration is for paid subscribers, with Docs accessibility for Enterprise plan users only. Gemini voice also offers integration with Workspace. Voice mode is currently available in English on Claude mobile apps. For free users, Claude has a daily limit of 20 to 30 voice messages. Paid plans have much higher limits depending on the type of plan. Users can choose among five voices. Voice mode is different from dictation in that Claude can talk back and converse with users. Last week, Anthropic released its most advanced models yet: Claude Open 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. These models can reason and also use tools like doing web searches. The startup also released four new capabilities for the Anthropic API to build AI agents: code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour.

That's where automation is great, because I actually want to spend more time in the creative part of it — designing, ultimately, what I'm shipping to my customers.\"Concerns over AI's potential to replace or impact coding jobs abound, with a recent report by VC firm SignalFire suggesting it's already contributing to the shrinking of entry-level tech opportunities for new grads. However, Dohmke said AI doesn't represent that big a departure from the existing coding process. Ultimately, he believes it's just another tool.\"Today, most engineers actually already start on code written by others,\" he said. \"They use open-source libraries, they use open-source operating systems, they have an editor that they're not building themselves, and a debugger, and a compiler.\"Even with the help of an AI assistant, engineers still need to understand the fundamental processes behind their work, Dohmke said — AI simply changes the way they go about completing it.\"We're already composing different pieces into software, and we're moving up the abstraction,\" he said. \"AI will help us to achieve that, and then we will review the work of the AI to make sure it's secure, and compliant, and runs efficiently.\"Dohmke did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.At its core, Dohmke doesn't believe that what it means to be a software engineer will really change.\"I think you know the developer will do mostly what engineers actually do, and how they define themselves, which is they're solving problems,\" he said. \"They're implementing ideas.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, says AI will automate the \"production\" side of software engineering.Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty ImagesGitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says AI will automate the \"production\" side of software engineering.That'll allow engineers to focus more on the creative parts of the process, he said in a podcast interview.Assistance from AI agents, he added, will allow engineers to reach the \"flow state\" with more ease.AI won't fundamentally change what it means to be a software engineer, said GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke — it'll just allow them to be more creative.\"My creativity during the coding process is limited by the time that I have available and the energy that I have — the amount of distraction I get,\" he said in a YouTube interview with newsletter author Azeem Azhar. \"Oftentimes, developers describe that as the magical flow state.

        "description": "Creators and advertisers are encouraged by new LinkedIn metrics that make it easier to measure clicks and conversions. LinkedIn has introduced a range of creator metrics aimed at giving brands and marketers deeper insights into the platform’s influence and ROI. As of Wednesday (May 28), LinkedIn creators can now track how many profile views and followers they gain from each post, as well as how many times each post generates a click on creators’ “custom buttons” — which direct followers to creators’ online stores, newsletters or other web pages of their choice. The “followers gained from this post” metric can, for instance, help creators understand how their posts are driving growth, which they can leverage when working with brands, according to LinkedIn vp of product management Gyanda Sachdeva. “‘Premium custom button interactions’ (like clicks to a website or newsletter for Premium members), on the other hand, gives them a way to show how their content drives action, which can be valuable in securing partnerships,” Sachdeva added.

        "description": "Ready or not, the quantum revolution is nearly here. Executives from IBM, Microsoft, IonQ and D-Wave told BI how corporate leaders should prepare. Quantum computing will change the tech landscape as much as artificial intelligence has. Execs from IBM, Microsoft, IonQ, PsiQuantum, and D-Wave told BI that corporate leaders should be preparing now.D-WaveReady or not, the quantum computing revolution is nearly here.Companies that don't evolve with the changing tech landscape risk falling behind their competitors.Execs from IBM, Microsoft, IonQ, PsiQuantum, and D-Wave say corporate leaders should prepare now.You'd be hard pressed to find a company out there that's not using some form of AI at this point. In just a few years, tech leaders say the same will be true of quantum computing. \"It's equivalent to the exact thing that you're seeing with classical computing and AI, but it's going to happen at a much larger scale,\" Jay Gambetta, the vice president in charge of IBM's quantum initiative, told Business Insider.Researchers are optimistic about coming breakthroughs in quantum computing, a field that leverages quantum physics and mechanics to solve complex problems faster than is possible using classical computers.When the final engineering problems are solved and the technology scales up, quantum tech promises to revolutionize medicine, data privacy, and more.Industry insiders say it's just a matter of time before quantum computing changes the tech landscape as much as artificial intelligence has, so corporate leaders had better start getting ready.\"If you're not paying attention and you're not dedicating people to quantum computing, I think it's probably already too late,\" Gambetta said.'Future-proof' computing is hybridAI and quantum computing are not interchangeable tools — each has its own very different strengths. Artificial intelligence is especially good at searching through existing data to make predictions about future outcomes, and is helpful in areas like image recognition, e-commerce recommendation engines, and fraud detection.A utility-scale quantum computer doesn't predict using data from the past, Stratton Sclavos, PsiQuantum's Chief Business Officer, told Business Insider. Instead, it calculates the exact answer from first principles, from scratch, \"to solve problems that no conventional computer or AI will ever be able to solve.\"\"If you're currently using or ramping up your use of AI, keep going,\" Sclavos said. But, he said, corporate leaders should be \"preparing now for how quantum computing will transform how your business operates.\"Aseem Datar, Microsoft's vice president of product innovation, strategic missions, and technologies, told Business Insider that, given the rapid pace of innovation, \"it's critical that organizations start exploring, identifying, and building an application road map that sets them up for success in a quantum future.\"For instance, Microsoft recently released Discovery, an agentic AI platform for scientific research and development built on top of its Azure cloud computing program. Datar said the technology was designed to be as \"future-proof\" as possible so that when quantum technology advances, it will be readily incorporated into the existing technology, and users \"will get the benefits of quantum underneath the platform.\"While Microsoft Discovery is geared toward the scientific community, Datar said future-looking tech solutions across industries will share similar characteristics. Hybrid computing integration, which combines the strengths of classical computing power with those of quantum systems, is particularly important, he said, so corporate leaders don't have to rip and replace their systems once quantum technology reaches its potential.Murray Thom, D-Wave's vice president of quantum technology evangelism, agreed, telling Business Insider: \"Hybrid quantum-classical solutions are what's going to give them the resiliency that they're looking for in their businesses.\"Thom added that organizations need to be aware of and ready for the speed of change that the tech landscape will undergo as quantum technology scales up, \"so that they can take advantage of the technology and not be at a competitive disadvantage if they miss what the newest capabilities are.\"\"When you're evaluating a new technology, you have to keep in mind that there's the information you have about what's possible today, and then there's what I call a cone of uncertainty that projects into the future,\" Thom said. \"You're looking to gain information that allows you to narrow that cone of uncertainty so that you can make better business decisions about what to do today to take advantage of that in the future — and particularly in a way that gives you robustness to those future outcomes.\"'The toothpaste is not going back in the tube.'It's not just private industry that's getting ready for the quantum revolution. Tim Kelly, the mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee, told Business Insider he's investing heavily in his city's ability to lean into a quantum future, with hopes it can become a hot spot for development of the technology.\"We intend to try to make the most of it from an economic development perspective,\" Kelly said. \"I think we're right at the leading edge of this, and the toothpaste is not going back in the tube, and so even though it's very early innings yet, this will change the world in a very fundamental way.\"Other cities, including Chicago, Boston, and Boulder, Colorado, are also investing in quantum research and industrial hubs to ensure they can capitalize on the economic growth the burgeoning industry is expected to usher in.As the quantum snowball keeps rolling downhill for both the public and private sectors, Niccolo de Masi, CEO of IonQ, told Business Insider that early adopters will gain a massive advantage if they start now to identify the best use cases for their industries, developing and optimizing hybrid algorithms ahead of time so they're ready when the first utility-scale quantum computers turn on.Those that don't start now, he said, risk becoming obsolete.\"This might sound extreme, but as the joke always goes, CEOs have made plenty of decisions over the past 10,000 years that they've gotten fired for — for making the wrong decision,\" de Masi said. \"I think CEOs are going to get fired if they're not up on the quantum revolution in a lot of industries, because they're just going to be so far behind.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

I don't mean missing a particular feature that's been removed from modern versions or a specific productivity setting that's no longer supported. I mean a sense of longing for the vibes of the computer interface you grew up with, an ache for the aesthetics of user interfaces past. I would have thought I was immune to this particular brand of nostalgia. Then I happened upon Desktop Survivors 98, a new Vampire Survivors-style \"bullet heaven\" autoshooter that leans hard into the aesthetics of the late '90s Windows machines I grew up with. And while that low-res, 256-color presentation is what drew me in, it was the intriguing mouse-controlled gameplay underneath that has kept me coming back for more retro-styled action all week. Start me up When it comes to capturing the feel of the '90s computer environment, Desktop Survivors 98 gets everything just right. This is in large part due to rampant theft of familiar old-school icons; items like My Computer, Calculator, Minesweeper, Search, and more look like they were taken directly from a classic Microsoft tile set. The game's low-res desktop backgrounds and Windows also look like they came out of a years-old Microsoft style book.Read full article Comments",

This week marked three major developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Microsoft is making Windows agentic, while OpenAI is developing AI-native devices with former Apple designer Jony Ive. Meanwhile, Google is embedding agentic checkout in Search. Here’s this week’s AI roundup. Agentic Transformation of Windows Microsoft is re-architecting Windows as an agentic AI platform, ushering in one of the most significant overhauls in the operating system’s history. This move is a key part of the company’s strategy to build the technical foundation for an open, agent-driven web. Speaking at Microsoft Build 2025, CEO Satya Nadella said he believes generative AI has now reached the stage where AI agents will proliferate. “In 2025, we’re building out this open agentic web at scale,” he said. Microsoft also unveiled NLWeb, which can turn any website into an agentic website. This enables any business to offer customers an AI agent experience. Read more: Microsoft’s Radical Bet Turns Windows Into an AI Playground OpenAI Is Acquiring Jony Ive’s Startup Io OpenAI is acquiring io, an AI devices startup founded by former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and other Apple designers, for $6.4 billion in equity. Io will become the hardware division of OpenAI, tapping into the creative genius of Ive, who as Steve Job’s protégé led the design of the iPhone, iPod, Apple Watch and other hardware. Altman wants to reinvent devices for the AI era, lamenting that it takes several cumbersome steps today to access ChatGPT: Turn on the computer, open a web browser, go to ChatGPT’s website, type in a prompt and wait for an answer. He thinks there’s a better way. Ive, for his part, called Altman a “rare visionary.” Read more: OpenAI Acquires Jony Ive’s AI Device Startup for $6.4B Google Embeds Agentic Checkout in Search Google unveiled new shopping capabilities in Search designed to compete with AI chatbots increasingly used for eCommerce. At this week’s Google I/O conference, the company announced that Search’s AI Mode will soon help users browse products, try on clothing virtually, and receive price alerts. These upgrades aim to simplify online shopping and personalize the experience. Google also introduced “agentic checkout,” enabling Search to add items to a cart and complete purchases either with user confirmation or autonomously. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 AI model, these features will roll out in the coming months. This makeover is part of Google’s plan to transform Search into one integrated AI assistant. “This is the future of Google Search, a search that goes beyond information to intelligence,” said Elizabeth Reid, head of Google Search. Read more: Google to Embed Agentic Checkout, Virtual Try-on in Search AI-Run Company Misses Expectations Carnegie Mellon researchers created a virtual software company run entirely by AI agents, just to see how they would do. The result: While agents were good at highly cerebral tasks, they failed in simple ones that are intuitive to humans — like waiting 10 minutes before escalating a task or closing a pop-up window. In their research paper, the team let LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others interact with the AI agents in the company to see how they would do. The best performer was Anthropic’s Claude, but it only completed 24% of tasks — still an ‘F’ grade in any school. Read more: Are AI Agents Ready to Take Over Human Work? New Study Says Not Yet Arm Eyes Intel’s Market Share Arm is making a push into the PC market, projecting that it would capture 40% of PCs and tablets shipped this year with its power-efficient architecture, which already powers 99% of smartphones. While Intel still dominates in devices like Chromebooks, Arm is gaining ground as AI reshapes personal computing. In an exclusive interview with PYMNTS, Chris Bergey, head of Arm’s client line of business, said the company’s energy-efficient designs give it an edge in the AI era, especially for devices processing AI workloads locally. Edge computing, which enhances privacy, reduces latency and cuts cloud costs, is becoming essential in PCs, positioning Arm as a key player in next-generation AI-enabled devices.

        "description": "Internal reports from Microsoft employees allege the company has blocked emails that contain specific terms including \"Palestine,\" \"Gaza,\" and \"genocide.\" The filtering, according to a group of activist employees, did not affect messages referencing \"Israel\" or those using modified spellings such as \"P4lestine.\"The activist coalition, No Azure for Apartheid, made up of Microsoft workers critical of the company’s relationship with Israel, says the block affected both internal and outgoing messages. The group reported that many employees, across departments, found their emails undelivered if the flagged terms appeared in either the subject line or the body.These allegations surfaced shortly after a series of high-profile protests staged by the group during Microsoft’s annual Build developer conference. Demonstrations disrupted keynotes and panel discussions throughout the week. On May 19, an employee identified as Joe Lopez interrupted CEO Satya Nadella’s address and was subsequently fired. Additional protests followed on subsequent days, including actions involving both current and former staff members.The group views the email restrictions as a form of workplace censorship. “This is an attempt to silence workers and punish those who speak out in support of Palestinian rights,” the group stated, arguing the policy disproportionately affects Palestinian employees and their allies.Microsoft, when questioned, confirmed that it had implemented steps to limit mass emails it described as “politically motivated.” The company cited the need to keep internal communication channels focused on work-related matters. It emphasized that employees interested in political issues could use a separate opt-in forum provided by the company.Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to face scrutiny over its ties to the Israeli government. Activists allege that Azure cloud services support Israeli military operations. The company has denied this, saying a third-party investigation found no proof that its technology had been used to harm civilians in Gaza.In a statement, Microsoft acknowledged it had provided limited support to Israel during a hostage crisis in October 2023 but emphasized that assistance was closely monitored and aligned with the company’s values. “We evaluated requests case-by-case, granting some and rejecting others,” the statement read, adding that the company aimed to help save lives while protecting civilian rights.The controversy places Microsoft at the intersection of worker activism, global politics, and corporate responsibility, raising broader questions about how tech companies manage internal dissent and international partnerships in a polarized geopolitical climate.Its is important to note that Microsoft is not alone in facing scrutiny. Other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, have also been criticized for their involvement in or silence around the crisis in Gaza. Google and Amazon, in particular, have faced internal backlash over Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud contract with the Israeli government, which employees allege could enable surveillance and military operations against Palestinians. Meta has been repeatedly accused of suppressing Palestinian content on its platforms while allowing inflammatory material from other sources to circulate. Critics argue that these companies, in prioritizing lucrative government contracts and geopolitical neutrality, have undergone a form of moral death — abandoning ethical leadership in favor of silence, profit, or complicity. As calls for accountability grow louder, these firms must now confront the ethical weight of their technologies and the human consequences of their business decisions.In response to the growing criticism of tech companies seen as complicit in the oppression of Palestinians, public backlash has manifested through widespread boycotts and divestment campaigns. Consumers around the world have increasingly turned away from businesses that openly support or maintain ties with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon—especially those involved in contracts with the Israeli government. Activists have urged users to cancel subscriptions, delete accounts, and switch to alternative platforms, framing consumer choice as a form of resistance. These grassroots efforts reflect a rising global demand for ethical accountability in the tech industry and signal that public trust can no longer be taken for granted when human rights are at stake.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: • Rising Digital Discontent: UK Gen Z Shows Deep Regret Over Online Life• Why So Many People Stay Up Late on Their Phones (Even When They’re Tired)",

        "description": "AI features in Windows are gradually becoming more widespread and inescapable. By late 2021, major updates for Windows' built-in Notepad text editor had been so rare for so long that a gentle redesign and a handful of new settings were rated as a major update. New updates have become much more common since then, but like the rest of Windows, recent additions have been overwhelmingly weighted in the direction of generative AI. In November, Microsoft began testing an update that allowed users to rewrite or summarize text in Notepad using generative AI. Another preview update today takes it one step further, allowing you to write AI-generated text from scratch with basic instructions (the feature is called Write, to differentiate it from the earlier Rewrite). Like Rewrite and Summarize, Write requires users to be signed into a Microsoft Account, because using it requires you to use your monthly allotment of Microsoft's AI credits. Per this support page, users without a paid Microsoft 365 subscription get 15 credits per month. Subscribers with Personal and Family subscriptions get 60 credits per month instead.Read full article Comments",

Microsoft is transforming Windows into an agentic AI platform, marking one of the biggest shifts in the operating system’s history as the software giant starts building the underpinnings of the new open, agentic web. At this week’s Microsoft Build 2025, CEO Satya Nadella said the internet’s legacy systems need to be reconfigured to work with the coming wave of AI agents. “We’re just about getting into these middle innings of another platform shift, and these middle innings are where all things happen,” Nadella said. The CEO noted that in past technology transformations – such as the cloud and mobile — after the initial wave of early adoption, software engineers get to work in the “middle innings” to transform visions into a practical reality. Nadella said this is where generative AI is today. “In 2025, we’re building out this open agentic web at scale,” Nadella said. Microsoft’s moves come at a time when companies are rapidly adopting GenAI as a way to build a competitive edge, according to PYMNTS data. Nearly two-thirds of product leaders use the tech to innovate, while more than a third use it to collect feedback on those products. Read More: From Spark to Strategy: How Product Leaders Are Using GenAI to Gain a Competitive Edge Retooling the Tech At Build, Microsoft announced a slew of foundational updates that will enable autonomous AI agents to reason, act, and collaborate directly within Windows, turning the world’s most widely used desktop operating system into an intelligent platform for a new generation of software. The move is part of Microsoft’s broader strategy to build out what it calls the ‘agentic web,’ where intelligent agents can seamlessly interact with data, apps, and users. To that end, Microsoft is directly embedding Model Context Protocol (MCP) into Windows. Developed by Anthropic, MCP is a protocol that allows agents to interact with your computer. “We’re going to be doing a whole bunch of work over the next handful of months with our partners and collaborators at Anthropic to make sure that the really tough enterprise problems that need to be solved on top of a protocol like MCP get resolved,” Nadella said. Using MCP, AI agents like GitHub Copilot can do more than write code; they can also install software, access files and folders, change system settings, open and interact with apps — with the user’s approval. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, Payments Execs on Agentic AI: ‘The Back Office Will Never Be the Same,’ MCP is revolutionary. It serves as the lingua franca for AI models to communicate back and forth, and a game-changing technology that produces better outcomes than previously manual efforts. Read more: Payments Execs on Agentic AI: ‘The Back Office Will Never Be the Same Turning any website agentic Supporting this shift is the Foundry Local, Microsoft’s new tool that lets your PC run AI features without needing the internet. It lets apps and assistants think, act, and help directly on the device for faster responses and better privacy. Foundry Local is built into Windows and works with new AI-powered PCs, making it easier for developers to create intelligent software that understands what users need and gets things done for them. Sarbjeet Johal, founder of tech search firm Stackpane, said on X that combining native support for MCP on Windows with Foundry Local is a “killer combination for developers.” Also unveiled at the conference is Copilot Tuning, a new feature that allows enterprises to fine-tune or customize AI agents using their own data, tone, and workflows. Developers can train models that reflect a company’s legal style, financial knowledge, or industry-specific jargon. This capability ensures that agents go beyond being general-purpose assistants — they also become experts of the data and processes of each organization. Microsoft also announced NLWeb, an open standard that can transform any website into an agentic website. It lets AI agents understand and take action on web content. “The idea behind NLWeb is it is a way for anyone who has a website — or an API — to very easily make their website or their API an agentic application,” said Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott at the conference. It’s like “HTML for the agentic web,” Scott added. Microsoft is working with companies like Tripadvisor to deploy NLWeb so their websites can let AI agents search and book trips directly.

        "description": "Authorities, along with tech companies including Microsoft and Cloudflare, say they’ve disrupted Lumma. A consortium of global law enforcement agencies and tech companies announced on Wednesday that they have disrupted the infostealer malware known as Lumma. One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls “cyber threat actors” to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma’s infrastructure. At the same time, the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s command and control infrastructure and disrupted cybercriminal marketplaces that sold the Lumma malware. All of this was coordinated, too, with the disruption of regional Lumma infrastructure by Europol’s European Cybercrime Center and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center. Microsoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is “easy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a “go-to tool,” including for the notorious Scattered Spider cybercriminal gang. Attackers distribute the malware using targeted phishing attacks that typically impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims.Read full article Comments",

Announced at the company’s ongoing Build conference, the updates include the addition of Cosmos DB to Fabric, a new digital twin builder capability in Real-Time Intelligence workloads, and a Copilot experience in Power BI. Analysts see these updates as a transition of Fabric tying into Microsoft’s vision of the future. “With the addition of operational databases like Cosmos DB and SQL Server, real-time agents, and semantic governance, Fabric is no longer just a data platform, it is a decision infrastructure layer for any enterprise,” said Michael Ni, principal analyst at Constellation Research.",

        "description": "Jay ParikhMicrosoftMicrosoft hired ex-Facebook global head of engineering Jay Parikh to lead a new AI unit called CoreAI.Internal memos Parikh has sent to employees reveal the unit's early ambitions and accomplishments.Parikh's initiatives focus on cultural shifts, operational improvements, and customer focus.Microsoft envisions an \"age of AI agents,\" and CEO Satya Nadella recently tapped one of Mark Zuckerberg's former top lieutenants to bring it to reality.In January, Nadella put Jay Parikh in charge of a new AI unit called CoreAI, central to Microsoft's ambition to help developers build digital personal assistants capable of taking over tasks from human workers.Amid Parikh's first Microsoft Build developer conference in this new role, internal memos reveal his goals for the unit, its early accomplishments, and his advice to address what he sees as problems within the company. Microsoft declined to comment.A fresh perspective for the 'next phase of Microsoft'Behind the scenes at Microsoft, Nadella prides himself on hiring outside talent from other big technology companies to add fresh perspective and giving them wide latitude to change how things are done, several people close to the CEO told BI.Those reports include Charlie Bell, who helped build Amazon's cloud from its earliest days before defecting to Microsoft to become its security boss, and AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, an ex-Google executive who joined the company from AI startup Inflection.Parikh joined their ranks in October after running cloud security company Laceworks, acquired in 2024. He previously was vice president and global head of engineering for Meta. Zuckerberg has publicly credited Parikh for many technological achievements during his 11-year tenure at the company.When Nadella announced Parikh's hiring in an email to employees, he wrote that the \"next phase of Microsoft\" would require \"adding exceptional talent\" from outside the company.In January, when Microsoft reorganized to create a new organization under Parikh. The group, called CoreAI, combined teams from Parikh's new direct reports like Eric Boyd, a corporate vice president of AI platform; Jason Taylor, a deputy CTO for AI infrastructure; Julia Liuson, president of the developer division; and Tim Bozarth, a corporate vice president of developer infrastructure. Nadella said at the time that Parikh would also work closely with the cloud-and-AI chief Scott Guthrie; the experiences-and-devices leader Rajesh Jha; Bell, the security boss; Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO; and Kevin Scott, the company's CTO.A copy of Parikh's latest org chart viewed by Business Insider shows he has nearly 10,000 reports, most of whom (about 7,000) are in the developer division under Liuson.MicrosoftParikh's 'agent factory' visionFour months in, Parikh has started to make his mark on Microsoft with a vision to create an AI \"agent factory.\" In the early days of Microsoft, cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen had ambitions to create the world's first \"software factory,\" a company full of programmers who would build everything from applications to operating systems.Parikh said he met with Gates and discussed his own concept, a production line for AI agents and applications.\"Building our vision demands this type of culture — one where Al is embedded in how we think, design, and deliver,\" Parikh wrote in an April 14 email to his team. \"The Agent Factory reflects this shift — not just in what we build, but in how we build it together. If we want every developer (and everyone) to shape the future, we have to get there first.\"The memos reveal some of the developments at CoreAI since Parikh's arrival.Since January, Foundry — Microsoft's AI platform for developers — has \"delivered $337 million of favorable COGS (cost of goods sold) impact year-to-date, with a projected $606 million on an annualized basis,\" according to one of Parikh's memos.Microsoft won new customers for its AI programming tool GitHub Copilot, deploying \"5,000+ Copilot Business seats\" for Fidelity with 5,000 more expected, another memo stated. Copilot Business sells for $19 per user per month, which would make the deal worth as much as $2.28 million annually at full price, though customers often get discounts for large deals. Fidelity declined to comment.Startup Harvey AI, meanwhile, has agreed to a two-year $150 million commitment to consume Azure cloud services, according to one of Parikh's memos. Harvey AI declined to comment.Making Microsoft think macroThe memos viewed by BI show how Parikh appears to be taking seriously his mandate to introduce a new perspective to the company and fix procedural problems that Microsoft may not be able to see that it has.In a May 10 email to his team, Parikh said shifting the company's culture is \"essential\" to its future, and outlined progress toward priorities like accelerating the pace at which employees work, breaking down siloes to work better as one team, and making products more reliable and secure.\"One of my early observations coming into Microsoft is that we sometimes treat symptoms rather than systems,\" Parikh wrote in a May 5 email. \"We often focus too much on the micro, which results in band-aids and bolt-ons vs taking a broader system view (which may mean thinking beyond what one team directly owns). This often leads to more complexity and operational burden. We'll help each other get better at this.\"Parikh's plan to get Microsoft to focus on the macro is to create a \"learning loop\" with a debrief after every product launch, incident, customer meeting, internal meeting, or decision. He's started new processes to make this happen, according to the memos.Parikh has an \"Ops Review\" series, going team by team to make specific improvements but also to \"find common patterns of engineering pain that need broader improvements,\" he wrote. The reviews, he explained, focus on longer-term operational metrics to help with strategy. \"We are zooming out and taking a more end-to-end view of a team's operational setup, creating space for an open discussion around what's working and what's not.\" The reviews began in April with the App Services team.Also among Parikh's mandates: more customer focus. His organization is required to conduct reviews of major incidents, like outages, that could impact customers, and chart how quickly the teams identified the problem and deployed a fix.He also started \"get well plans\" for unhappy customers after he \"encountered a couple of fairly unhappy customers\" in recent meetings, according to an April 26 email. His solution? Weekly reviews to \"understand where we went off track, identify solutions, and execute the recovery plan,\" tracking progress until the accounts \"get well again.\"What Parikh thinks Microsoft should change so farIn the May 5 email, Parikh shared \"several recurring themes and insights\" within Microsoft that he believes the company should seek to change or simplify.First, he encouraged his organization to engage engineers from outside their direct team because \"different perspectives help.\"In his view, Microsoft also takes too long and the process is too hard to deprecate, or discourage use of, old versions of software. \"Supporting too many versions is unattainable,\" Parikh wrote. \"We are following up with C+Al (the Cloud + AI organization, under Scott Guthrie) to brainstorm how we can modernize and streamline this.\"Incident reviews are overloaded with metrics that don't have enough value, Parikh wrote, and Microsoft sends out too many alerts, which creates noise. \"It's important to periodically zoom out and audit how your monitoring is running and to simplify if you are overloaded on alerts and metrics. Use Al to help triage complex alerting situations,\" he urged.Parikh encouraged his teams to \"see the forest for the trees on scalability,\" and to organize brainstorming sessions when faced with a traffic load they can't support to see what it would take to support five or 10 times as much traffic. \"You may be stuck in a local maxima with incremental improvements, and it might be time to brainstorm how you can get a step function more scale,\" he wrote.He also recommended employees seek to address classes of problems, not just one-offs. \"Quick fixes lead to complexity,\" Parikh wrote. \"Instead of band-aids, we should aim for broader system improvements that solve whole categories of issues and boost long-term efficiency.\"\"We're building muscle in spotting patterns, not just patching symptoms,\" Parikh wrote. \"And that's a big deal.\"Got a tip?

Effective immediately, Signal for Windows will by default block the ability of Windows to screenshot the app. Signal users who want to disable the block—for instance to preserve a conversation for their records or make use of accessibility features for sight-impaired users—will have to change settings inside their desktop version to enable screenshots.

        "description": "For the first time, new quantum-safe algorithms can be invoked using standard Windows APIs. Microsoft is updating Windows 11 with a set of new encryption algorithms that can withstand future attacks from quantum computers in an attempt to jump-start what’s likely to be the most formidable and important technology transition in modern history. Computers that are based on the physics of quantum mechanics don’t yet exist outside of sophisticated labs, but it’s well-established science that they eventually will. Instead of processing data in the binary state of zeros and ones, quantum computers run on qubits, which encompass myriad states all at once. This new capability promises to bring about new discoveries of unprecedented scale in a host of fields, including metallurgy, chemistry, drug discovery, and financial modeling. Averting the cryptopocalypse One of the most disruptive changes quantum computing will bring is the breaking of some of the most common forms of encryption, specifically, the RSA cryptosystem and those based on elliptic curves. These systems are the workhorses that banks, governments, and online services around the world have relied on for more than four decades to keep their most sensitive data confidential. RSA and elliptic curve encryption keys securing web connections would require millions of years to be cracked using today’s computers. A quantum computer could crack the same keys in a matter of hours or minutes.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Microsoft has joined a sustainable aviation fuel program managed by its logistics provider and a major cargo airline. The post Microsoft volunteers for fuel premium to move server racks by air appeared first on FreightWaves. Microsoft is committing to pay extra for freight transportation to cover the cost of using sustainable aviation fuel on flights carrying server racks. Luxembourg-based Cargolux, the 10th-largest cargo airline by traffic, and Microsoft’s logistics service provider AIT Worldwide Logistics, announced Tuesday that the tech giant has signed a large deal to support the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel, which is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The companies said the partnership will save 72,750 tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide over the next three years. The SAF, produced and delivered by Valero Marketing & Supply Company and its Diamond Green Diesel LLC joint venture, is based on used cooking oil and tallow – without palm oil or any derivatives. The biofuel is added to Cargolux’s fuel supply at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. Microsoft will receive green credits for its SAF contributions through a certified registry. “Collaboration across our supply chain ecosystem is crucial as we continue to drive toward Microsoft’s sustainability goals. By working together to increase the production and use of SAF, we can help to cost effectively drive down emissions and increase the potential for more use of alternative fuels across the transport ecosystem,” Colin Todd, Microsoft’s general manager of cloud manufacturing operations and fulfillment, said in a news release. Cargolux operates a fleet of 30 Boeing 747-8 and 747-400 freighter aircraft. It has an order with Boeing for 10 next-generation 777-8 freighters to replace aging 747-400s, with deliveries expected to start sometime late this decade. Sustainable fuels can reduce 80% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based fuel, although some critics say the life cycle emissions of production and transport to airports can cancel out the benefits.

        "description": "A year ago today, Microsoft unveiled what it believed would be the future of home computing. Copilot+ PCs, optimized to harness the power of AI, were introduced with the promise of revolutionizing how we interact with our laptops and desktops. The reaction, however, was far from enthusiastic. Critics mocked the addition of an AI button on the keyboard, likening it to the redundant action keys from late-1990s PCs. More concerning was the backlash to Recall, a feature designed to continuously record user activity to provide smarter assistance. Many found the idea invasive. Public alarm grew when it became clear that Recall stored this data off-device, raising serious privacy concerns—particularly with sensitive tasks like entering bank details. The feature was eventually, well, recalled. “Copilot+ PCs are finally here. You don’t want one—yet,” read one scathing op-ed published in Computer World at the time. Fast-forward a year, and the landscape has shifted. AI adoption continues to grow, and the once-ridiculed concept of agentic AI has gained traction. That shift in sentiment has helped normalize features like Recall, which quietly returned in the April 2025 Windows 11 update. This time, it’s opt-in rather than opt-out, and stores screenshots locally instead of on the cloud. In the background, Microsoft has been refining its AI offerings. The company’s updated Copilot+ strategy seems more measured, and after a year of growing accustomed to AI in our daily lives, users may now be more ready for what these devices offer. Microsoft says Copilot+ PCs accounted for “up to 15% of premium-priced U.S. laptops” during the 2024 holiday quarter—the first specific sign of market traction. Analysts at Gartner predict that by the end of 2026, every enterprise PC sold will be AI-equipped, with consumer adoption expected to follow soon after. Persistence also plays a role in adoption. “It’s become more and more prominent in Windows 11 in particular,” says Catherine Flick, a researcher in AI and ethics at the University of Staffordshire. “People who might otherwise be skeptical or not want to touch it, might just go in because it’s so conveniently there,” she says. “It doesn’t seem to cost anything at the moment, so yeah, basically people are going to use it.” Every new user represents a win for Microsoft, helping to normalize AI as part of everyday workflows. While there may still be no single “killer app” that compels users to buy an AI-powered PC, growing familiarity can be just as powerful as clever marketing. With momentum building, the moment for Copilot+ PCs may have finally arrived.",

Over the past year, the likes of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have sent out a flurry of announcements related to nuclear energy. Some are about agreements to purchase power from existing plants, while others are about investments looking to boost unproven advanced technologies. This story is a part of MIT Technology Review’s series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution. These somewhat unlikely partnerships could be a win for both the nuclear power industry and large tech companies. Tech giants need guaranteed sources of energy, and many are looking for low-emissions ones to hit their climate goals. For nuclear plant operators and nuclear technology developers, the financial support of massive established customers could help keep old nuclear power plants open and push new technologies forward. “There [are] a lot of advantages to nuclear,” says Michael Terrell, senior director of clean energy and carbon reduction at Google. Among them, he says, are that it’s “clean, firm, carbon-free, and can be sited just about anywhere.” (Firm energy sources are those that provide constant power.) But there’s one glaring potential roadblock: timing. “There are needs on different time scales,” says Patrick White, former research director at the Nuclear Innovation Alliance. Many of these tech companies will require large amounts of power in the next three to five years, White says, but building new nuclear plants can take close to a decade. Some next-generation nuclear technologies, especially small modular reactors, could take less time to build, but the companies promising speed have yet to build their first reactors—and in some cases they are still years away from even modestly sized demonstrations. This timing mismatch means that even as tech companies tout plans for nuclear power, they’ll actually be relying largely on fossil fuels, keeping coal plants open, and even building new natural gas plants that could stay open for decades. AI and nuclear could genuinely help each other grow, but the reality is that the growth could be much slower than headlines suggest. AI’s need for speed The US alone has roughly 3,000 data centers, and current projections say the AI boom could add thousands more by the end of the decade. The rush could increase global data center power demand by as much as 165% by 2030, according to one recent analysis from Goldman Sachs. In the US, estimates from industry and academia suggest energy demand for data centers could be as high as 400 terawatt-hours by 2030—up from fewer than 100 terawatt-hours in 2020 and higher than the total electricity demand from the entire country of Mexico. There are indications that the data center boom might be decelerating, with some companies slowing or pausing some projects in recent weeks. But even the most measured projections, in analyses like one recent report from the International Energy Agency, predict that energy demand will increase. The only question is by how much. Many of the same tech giants currently scrambling to build data centers have also set climate goals, vowing to reach net-zero emissions or carbon-free energy within the next couple of decades. So they have a vested interest in where that electricity comes from. Nuclear power has emerged as a strong candidate for companies looking to power data centers while cutting emissions. Unlike wind turbines and solar arrays that generate electricity intermittently, nuclear power plants typically put out a constant supply of energy to the grid, which aligns well with what data centers need. “Data center companies pretty much want to run full out, 24/7,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a consultancy focused on electricity and transmission. It also doesn’t hurt that, while renewables are increasingly politicized and under attack by the current administration in the US, nuclear has broad support on both sides of the aisle. The problem is how to build up nuclear capacity—existing facilities are limited, and new technologies will take time to build. In 2022, all the nuclear reactors in the US together provided around 800 terawatt-hours of electricity to the power grid, a number that’s been basically steady for the past two decades. To meet electricity demand from data centers expected in 2030 with nuclear power, we’d need to expand the fleet of reactors in the country by half. New nuclear news Some of the most exciting headlines regarding the burgeoning relationship between AI and nuclear technology involve large, established companies jumping in to support innovations that could bring nuclear power into the 21st century. In October 2024, Google signed a deal with Kairos Power, a next-generation nuclear company that recently received construction approval for two demonstration reactors from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The company is working to build small, molten-salt-cooled reactors, which it says will be safer and more efficient than conventional technology. The Google deal is a long-term power-purchase agreement: The tech giant will buy up to 500 megawatts of electricity by 2035 from whatever plants Kairos manages to build, with the first one scheduled to come online by 2030. Amazon is also getting involved with next-generation nuclear technology with a direct investment in Maryland-based X-energy. The startup is among those working to create smaller, more-standardized reactors that can be built more quickly and with less expense. In October, Amazon signed a deal with Energy Northwest, a utility in Washington state, that will see Amazon fund the initial phase of a planned X-energy small modular reactor project in the state. The tech giant will have a right to buy electricity from one of the modules in the first project, which could generate 320 megawatts of electricity and be expanded to generate as much as 960 megawatts. Many new AI-focused data centers under construction will require 500 megawatts of power or more, so this project might be just large enough to power a single site. The project will help meet energy needs “beginning in the early 2030s,” according to Amazon’s website. X-energy is currently in the pre-application process with the NRC, which must grant approval before the Washington project can move forward. Solid, long-term plans could be a major help in getting next-generation technologies off the ground. “It’s going to be important in the next couple [of] years to see more firm commitments and actual money going out for these projects,” says Jessica Lovering, who cofounded the Good Energy Collective, a policy research organization that advocates for the use of nuclear energy. However, these early projects won’t be enough to make a dent in demand. The next-generation reactors Amazon and Google are supporting are modestly sized demonstrations—the first commercial installations of new technologies. They won’t be close to the scale needed to meet the energy demand expected from new data centers by 2030. To provide a significant fraction of the terawatt-hours of electricity large tech companies use each year, nuclear companies will likely need to build dozens of new plants, not just a couple of reactors. Purchasing power One approach to get around this mismatch is to target existing reactors. Microsoft made headlines in this area last year when it signed a long-term power purchase agreement with Constellation, the owner of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Constellation plans to reopen one of the reactors at that site and rename it the Crane Clean Energy Center. The deal with Microsoft ensures that there will be a customer for the electricity from the plant, if it successfully comes back online. (It’s currently on track to do so in 2028.) “If you don’t want to wait a decade for new technology, one of the biggest tools that we have in our tool kit today is to support relicensing of operating power plants,” says Urvi Parekh, head of global energy for Meta. Older facilities can apply for 20-year extensions from the NRC, a process that customers buying the energy can help support as it tends to be expensive and lengthy, Parekh says. While these existing reactors provide some opportunity for Big Tech to snap up nuclear energy now, a limited number are in good enough shape to extend or reopen. In the US, 24 reactors have licenses that will be up for renewal before 2035, roughly a quarter of those in operation today. A handful of plants could potentially be reopened in addition to Three Mile Island, White says. Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan has received a $1.52 billion loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy to reopen, and the owner of the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa has filed a request with regulators that could begin the reopening process. Some sites have reactors that could be upgraded to produce more power without building new infrastructure, adding a total of between two and eight gigawatts, according to a recent report from the Department of Energy. That could power a handful of moderately sized data centers, but power demand is growing for individual projects—OpenAI has suggested the need for data centers that would require at least five gigawatts of power. Ultimately, new reactors will be needed to expand capacity significantly, whether they use established technology or next-generation designs. Experts tend to agree that neither would be able to happen at scale until at le",

        "description": "Pundits believe Google’s antitrust remedies will produce a similar result; optimists eye opportunity for independents. The closure of Microsoft Advertising’s demand-side platform is part of a broader shift toward AI-powered advertising and (arguably) the dawn of a new world order, one where Big Tech and independents operate in separate spheres. That’s the opinion of several Digiday sources consulted in the days since the May 14 announcement, with some wondering what the second-order impact, or opportunity for both independent DSPs and sell-side players. Last week, Microsoft Advertising told clients it would stop supporting its demand-side platform, Xandr Invest, starting in February. This was an apparent echo of the planned closure of Microsoft’s retail media network, PromoteIQ, as it appears to be consolidating its online advertising offering.

Altman described Codex as \"true software engineering task delegation.\"\"We've been talking about someday we'd get to a real agentic coding experience, and it's kind of wild to me that it's finally here,\" Altman said. \"I think this is one of the biggest changes to programming that I've ever seen.\"\"This idea that you now have a real virtual teammate that you can assign work to, that you can say, 'Hey, go off and do some of the stuff you were just doing and increasingly more advanced things,' you know at some point saying, 'I've got a big idea, go off and work for a couple of days and do it,'\" the OpenAI CEO added.The productivity gains can also be significant, Altman said.\"It was amazing to watch over the last few months as we were working on Codex internally — you know there's always a few people who are the early adopters — and how quickly the people who were just using Codex all day changed their workflow and just the incredible amount they were able to do relative to someone else was quite interesting,\" he said.Microsoft announced plans to expand the AI models available through Azure to integrate xAI's Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini. In a pre-recorded clip, Musk, who once interned at Microsoft, talked with Nadella about his first experiences using Microsoft software as well as Grok's capabilities.Microsoft also introduced \"Copilot Tuning\" to create agents using company data. The announcement confirmed Business Insider's reporting from last week that Microsoft was planning to",

Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux has become an important tool for developers and power users since it was introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update back in 2016, giving them access to a built-in Linux command line and Linux applications from within Windows. The company has steadily improved WSL since then, improving performance, making it easier to install and use, and adding features like GPU and audio support. But today as part of its Build developer conference, Microsoft announced that it would be making almost all of WSL open source, closing the very first issue that the then-new WSL project attracted on Github in 2016. \"WSL could never have been what it is today without its community,\" writes Microsoft Senior Software Engineer Pierre Boulay in the company's blog post. \"We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty images; Tyler Le/BIMicrosoft is among the latest to cut middle management jobs.Tech giants like Intel, Amazon, and Google are also flattening structures for efficiency.Experts warn that while flattening can speed decisions, it is possible to take it too far.Companies are shedding bloated layers of management in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy. Some employees are applauding the move, known as flattening the middle, in the hopes of getting faster and boosting efficiency.Microsoft said Tuesday it's slashing around 6,000 employees. While the days since have made it clear many of those cut were individual contributor-level engineers, executives previously told BI one motivation behind the recent cuts was to increase managers' \"span of control,\" or the number of reports per manager.Intel announced a great flattening last month, emphasizing more time in the office, less admin, and leaner teams.\"The best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,\" said the chip giant's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a memo to staff.Amazon has also increased the ratio of individual contributors to managers. They call it a \"builder ratio.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff late last year that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push. Meta has been at it for years, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing in a 2023 memo, \"flatter is faster.\"The risk is that these companies cut too many managers, leaving the remaining folks with too many direct reports.But for now, it appears to be a risk companies are willing to take.Agility and expertiseThe logic of cutting from the middle to speed up is sound, management experts say.\"You can't go faster and be more connected to a larger ecosystem if you're having to go up and down a hierarchy for every decision,\" Deborah Ancona, a professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Business Insider.While some companies have been trying for decades to zap management layers, there's a new urgency to do so. Businesses exist in \"an exponentially changing world,\" Ancona said.Dell executives explained this to employees earlier this month, when they began reorganizing managers to have more direct reports. The company, whose head count has dropped by 25,000 in two years, also pointed to the influx of artificial intelligence as a reason it needed to move faster.Ideally, companies would remove layers and spread decision-making throughout the organization so that those closest to customers or technology, for example, could generate ideas and make decisions, Ancona said.\"You're kind of flipping the organization,\" she said. \"Rather than all the ideas coming from on high, you have entrepreneurial leaders who are lower down in the organization coming up with new ideas.\"Bayer CEO Bill Anderson is leery of having to run everything up the chain. After taking over the German biotech company in 2023, he began implementing what he calls a \"dynamic shared ownership\" setup that has cut thousands of managers. Staffers come together in \"mini networks\" for 90-day stretches to work on projects.\"We hire highly educated, trained people, and then we put them in these environments with rules and procedures and eight layers of hierarchy,\" Anderson previously told BI. \"Then we wonder why big companies are so lame most of the time.\"Fewer managers, more reporting, more meetings?When middle managers are cut and layers condensed, inevitably, more workers report to fewer managers. The logistics of that vary, and the success in terms of morale has a lot to do with the starting point.Amazon started flattening last year. In September, CEO Andy Jassy ordered a 15% increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers by March. BI reported that senior Amazon Web Services managers received a memo in January instructing them to restrict high-level hiring and increase their number of direct reports.An Amazon spokesperson told BI at the time that the memo may have been intended for one team, but does not apply to the company at large. The Amazon spokesperson also referenced a September memo from Jassy on the importance of reducing management layers.An AWS manager told BI this month that the flatter structure has since put more burden on employees on her team to report on what they're doing day-to-day, in addition to their actual work, since managers have less time to inspect individuals' work.Plus, this manager said they are spending more time in meetings as they took on a more diverse group of direct reports. The Amazon spokesperson also emphasized that the individual employee's anecdote does not represent the company as a whole.Yvonne Lee-Hawkins was assigned 21 direct reports when she worked for Amazon's human resources. She told BI that she had to quickly learn new skills to handle the load, like asynchronous work strategies, but her teams' performance suffered as her number of reports grew from 11 to 21 employees.Weekly one-on-ones — the subject of much debate among tech titans — became impossible, and she had to cut them in half.At Microsoft, a half-dozen employees who spoke to BI about the manager flattening trend generally regarded it as a positive step to eliminate inefficient and unnecessary levels of managers. Some managers have as few as one or two reports.Microsoft ended up with many management layers, the people said, because it often tried to reward good engineers by promoting them to become managers. Often, those engineers-turned-managers still spent most of their time in the codebase and weren't very effective as managers.Meanwhile, larger groups of direct reports often work better for senior employees, who need less one-on-one time and can do more things in a group setting.A Microsoft spokesperson did not comment when asked about these factors.Gary Hamel, a visiting professor at London Business School who lives in Silicon Valley, told BI that pushing managers to take on more direct reports can reduce micromanaging, a common bane of corporate existence.When managers have a lot of people to oversee, it pushes them to hire people they trust, mentor rather than manage, and give up a \"pretty big dose\" of their authority.\"Those are all hugely positive things,\" he said, even if they require \"a fairly dramatic change\" in how managers see their role.How many direct reports is too many?Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously has 60 direct reports. Managers at Dell have been told they should have 15 to 20. An AWS document viewed by BI in January mandated no fewer than eight per manager, up from six. An Amazon spokesperson told BI there are no such requirements companywide.Gallup research indicates that the quality of a manager matters more than the number of direct reports in terms of how well teams perform. That's because more engaged managers tend to lead to more engaged teams. And small teams — those with fewer than 10 people — show both the highest and lowest levels of engagement because managers can have an outsize effect, for better or worse.That may explain why some companies seem to thrive with dozens of direct reports per manager and others fail.The nature of the work matters, too. When work is more complex, it can be harder for managers to oversee too many people.Managing dozens of people gets harder when \"life intersects with work,\" Ravin Jesuthasan, the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI.When employees have an issue, they often need someone to talk to about it.\"As a manager, you are the first port of call,\" he said.That's one reason, Jesuthasan said, that having something like 20 direct reports would likely be \"really hard.\" For most managers, the couple of dozen direct reports that many tech companies are aiming for is probably the limit, he said.Strong managers can powerfully boost a company's ability to develop talent and its bottom line. A 2023 analysis from McKinsey & Company, for example, found that organizations with \"top-performing\" managers led to significantly better total shareholder returns over five years compared with those entities that had only average or subpar managers.While flattening schemes may be successful at reducing bulk in the middle and speeding up decision-making, they can hinder future growth if they're not well-managed.Jane Edison Stevenson, global vice chair for board and CEO services at the organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry, told BI that removing layers from a management pyramid can help elevate those high performers. But flatter companies may fail to develop leaders who can pull together the disparate parts of an organization.At some point, she said, \"You've got to start to make a bet on the leaders that are going to have a chance to build muscle across, not just vertically.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty images; Tyler Le/BIMicrosoft is among the latest to cut middle management jobs.Tech giants like Intel, Amazon, and Google are also flattening structures for efficiency.Experts warn that while flattening can speed decisions, it is possible to take it too far.Companies are shedding bloated layers of management in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy.

        "description": "LinkedIn influencers, also known as LinkedIn-fluencers, are shaking up the creator economy with new approaches to B2B marketing and creator partnerships on the networking platform. According to a LinkedIn survey , “59% of tech buyers are already using LinkedIn to consume B2B influencer content.” Ogilvy data also reflects this trend, revealing that 75% of B2B businesses already utilize B2B LinkedIn influencers and 93% of CMOs plan to increase their use of such B2B influencers in marketing campaigns in the future. Although anyone can be a creator on the platform, LinkedIn influencers share distinct strategies that translate to their high-quality content, like sharing niche industry insights and offering useful advice or tools for working professionals. Image: DIW-AigenThe Influencer Marketing Factory recently published its Ultimate LinkedIn Influencer Guide , one of the first creator economy reports of its kind featuring exclusive data on top B2B LinkedIn influencers, LinkedIn influencer marketing performance, and overall sentiment towards LinkedIn influencer marketing. The Influencer Marketing Factory analyzed over 64,000 U.S.-based LinkedIn influencers to identify key trends and best practices for both creators and businesses. Plus, The Influencer Marketing Factory invited over 25 LinkedIn Top Voices, B2B influencers, and leaders in the creator economy to share their exclusive insights on the developing field of LinkedIn influencer marketing. 1. How do LinkedIn Influencers Differ from Other Creators? Unlike B2C creators, B2B LinkedIn influencers uplift brands with their “halo of credibility” thanks to their authentic approach to thought leadership, professional storytelling, and value-driven content. LinkedIn influencers also stand out from standard Instagram or TikTok influencers since LinkedIn has its own unique algorithm. LinkedIn’s algorithm recommends content on the condition that one of your connections or viewers engages with it via reactions, commenting, or reposting, while popular social platforms typically recommend content based on someone's sole interests and past engagement. Once someone engages with a creator’s post, that content will be shared in the individual’s followers’ and connections’ feeds, and so on, as the post continues to reach new users. With this in mind, LinkedIn creators must curate engaging, shareable content to reach diverse user networks since LinkedIn’s algorithm doesn’t recommend content simply based on past behaviors or interests. 2. Big Picture LinkedIn Trends The Influencer Marketing Factory analyzed LinkedIn creator data from Favikon across diverse sample sizes to better capture large-scale trends on the platform. The Influencer Marketing Factory’s analysis of 9,500 U.S.-based LinkedIn creators with over 3,000 followers revealed 12 key content niches dominating LinkedIn. Among these niches, Business & Entrepreneurship (15.6%) was the top content category among LinkedIn influencers. Other top niches include Tech & Innovation (6.2%) and Sales & Marketing (4.1%). 19% of LinkedIn creators have between 5,000 and 10,000 followers, while only 16% have 10,000 to 30,000 followers, according to The Influencer Marketing Factory’s analysis of 64,000 U.S.-based LinkedIn creators with over 1,000 followers—Favikon’s follower threshold to be considered a LinkedIn creator. A majority of LinkedIn influencers (71.36%) have an average engagement rate of 0-1%, as per The Influencer Marketing Factory’s analysis of 5,500 U.S.-based LinkedIn creators with over 3,000 followers. 3. Content Trends From LinkedIn’s Top 100 B2B Creators The following are some of The Influencer Marketing Factory’s top insights from its analysis of LinkedIn’s Top 100 B2B Creators, as categorized by Favikon. Images are the most common content category among B2B LinkedIn influencers at 43.7%. Videos are secondary to Images (27.7%), followed by Text posts (20.3%). Male creators make up the majority (72.9%) of LinkedIn’s Top 100 B2B accounts, while women only make up 27.1% of the pool, signaling an opportunity for more diversity and female voices in the B2B content space. The Influencer Marketing Factory revealed that the overwhelming majority (67.7%) of LinkedIn’s Top 100 B2B Creators are based in the United States, with 11.5% from the UK and 6.3% from India. 4. LinkedIn Influencer Marketing Trends The Influencer Marketing Factory analyzed a sample of 195 LinkedIn influencer marketing posts utilizing Favikon creator to better understand how often creators share promotional content on the platform, as well as which content performs best. The Influencer Marketing Factory’s analysis of 195 LinkedIn influencer marketing posts across various niches revealed that Images are the most common content category among creators at 42.3%. Approximately 4.52% of an influencer's LinkedIn posts are considered sponsored or paid promotions, according to The Influencer Marketing Factory’s analysis of 195 LinkedIn influencer marketing posts from 74 unique influencers. Influencer marketing sentiment on LinkedIn is overwhelmingly positive, with 73.2% of comments categorized as “Very Positive” and 11.1% as “Positive Leaning.” 5. Key Quotes & Takeaways from Industry Experts Interested in learning more about how to improve your LinkedIn content strategy as a brand or creator? The following are some of The Influencer Marketing Factory’s top insights on LinkedIn growth and how to share engaging content from leaders in the creator economy. LinkedIn’s Growing Influence: “LinkedIn is the platform to share unique knowledge and perspectives, allowing anyone to carve a niche for themselves and become associated as a subject matter expert…94% of audiences trust content on LinkedIn more than other platforms.” — Daniel Markovits, Creator & Community Manager at LinkedIn Lead With Stories, Connect With Purpose: “Think of LinkedIn as your personal newsroom. Position yourself as a thought leader by curating a mix of content: original insights, industry news with your commentary, and behind-the-scenes moments that showcase your journey.” — Raffaele Pieroni, Influencer Marketing Manager at Ogilvy Why Your Experience Belongs on LinkedIn: “Most people don't think they have enough knowledge or expertise to share on LinkedIn. But everybody has something worth sharing! Even if you are a few years into your career, you can share advice for somebody looking to be in your position. And seasoned professionals are always looking to see what the younger generation is doing.” — Vin Matano, Founder of Creatorbuzz Understanding the LinkedIn Algorithm: “I've interviewed the people who build LinkedIn's algorithm, and they tell me that the algo is looking for a few things: It rewards posts that contain knowledge and advice, that are written from a unique perspective, that build upon your area of expertise, and that drive meaningful comments. So write your posts with that in mind!” — Jason Feifer, Editor in Chief of Entrepreneur Magazine What Do I Post on LinkedIn?: “If you’re thinking about growing on LinkedIn right now, there are two content formats doing the heavy lifting when it comes to reach and engagement: vertical video and newsletters. And it's not just about the algorithm favoring these formats (though it does)—it’s about how people are showing up on LinkedIn today.” — Lia Haberman, Creator Economy Expert For more exclusive insights on LinkedIn influencer marketing and B2B content strategy, download The Influencer Marketing Factory’s Ultimate LinkedIn Influencer Guide with over 70 pages of free data and tips here.Read next: Try These Prompts in AI Chatbots To Go Deeper into Your Questions and Issues",

Chipmaker Nvidia is reportedly working to lessen its dependency on Big Tech. The company is doing this by forging new partnerships to sell artificial intelligence (AI) to national governments, corporations and challengers to companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (May 18). The report came days after Nvidia announced a multibillion-dollar U.S. chip deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, while the United Arab Emirates announced plans to build one of the world’s largest data centers in partnership with the American government, as the Gulf states work to construct massive AI infrastructure. According to the FT, these “sovereign AI” deals make up a key part of the $3.2 trillion tech giant’s strategy of attracting customers far beyond Silicon Valley. Company executives, industry insiders, and analysts tell the FT that Nvidia aims to boost its business beyond “hyperscalers,” or large cloud computing companies that make up more than half its data center revenue. That means boosting burgeoning rivals to the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, companies that include such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. Nvidia announced in February that CoreWeave was “the first cloud service provider to make the Nvidia Blackwell platform generally available,” referring to its newest generation of processors for AI data centers. The company has also forged collaborations with suppliers such as Cisco, Dell and HP, to help sell to enterprise customers, which manage their own corporate IT infrastructure rather than outsourcing to the cloud. “I’m more certain [about the business opportunity beyond the big cloud providers] today than I was a year ago,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the FT in March. Meanwhile, Nvidia said earlier this month that it is advancing what it calls “embodied intelligence,” or AI that can perceive, reason and act in industries that include manufacturing, biotechnology and transportation. Per a Fast Company report, the company sees these capabilities as critical to future breakthroughs in robotics, drug development and autonomous navigation. “For AI to be truly useful, it must engage meaningfully with real-world use cases,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning, told that magazine. At a tech conference in Singapore last month, Nvidia presented company-authored papers, covering healthcare, robotics, autonomous vehicles and large language models, continuing a collaborative push into AI that has seen partnerships with Google, GE Healthcare and GM.

        "description": "It’s been almost two months since ChatGPT’s image feature became super popular, and now Microsoft finally added something similar to Copilot. Looks like they’re trying to catch up with the others in the race.Earlier this spring, OpenAI reshaped how users engage with visual content by embedding image creation directly within GPT-4o’s native capabilities. Rather than leaning on external engines like DALL·E, ChatGPT began producing images natively—responding to prompts with greater precision, readable text, and clear stylistic alignment. The upgrade not only improved output fidelity but also introduced dynamic editing, letting users manipulate visuals with follow-up commands or modify uploaded photos in real time.That feature hit a nerve. In one week, users generated over 700 million images—showing both the demand for responsive visual AI and the virality of GPT-4o’s rollout.Now, Microsoft is integrating similar functionality into its Copilot platform. The upgrade lets Copilot users build visuals from scratch, refine them with detailed instructions, apply stylistic changes to existing images, and even render legible text—all within the same interface. Microsoft is positioning the feature as a major leap forward for creative professionals and casual users alike.However, the move has sparked commentary around timing. Microsoft’s update arrives weeks after ChatGPT's image features dominated the spotlight, and Google’s Gemini has also been iterating quickly. Although Microsoft unveiled the changes during its recent 50th anniversary event, much of what was presented mirrored capabilities already offered by competitors.Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft’s AI division, has pledged a vision of Copilot as an assistant that understands individual users on a personal level. Delivering on that ambition, though, may require faster execution and more original features—not just parity.With user expectations rising and innovation cycles accelerating, Microsoft’s challenge lies in keeping pace without simply retracing the paths others have already carved.Read next: Not Just Directions: Google Maps Became a Mirror of Daily Life Through 999 Million Local Reviews",

        "description": "Switch, PS5, and XBox might be the biggest names in video games, but David Lee and a group of entrepreneurial alums from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are carving out a niche market with Nex, a new alternative. The company’s Nex Playground device has sold more than 200,000 units. Instead of buying individual games, families buy a subscription-based collection of 40-plus titles. Like the old Nintendo Wii, Nex focuses on family-friendly, movement-based games. The Nex device plugs into TVs for motion-controlled experiences. Instead of controllers, the device uses a built-in camera that enables you to play games by moving your hands and feet. With national retail expansion underway across 5,000 stores, Nex positions itself as a simpler alternative to pricier, fancier, thumb-based video games. Fast Company spoke with Lee, the founding CEO, about how Nex competes against industry giants and how the company develops distinct hardware and games. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. How do you position Nex in relation to Nintendo and Xbox? We all have a focus on core customers. Nintendo went back to what they were doing—handheld gaming and Mario—their biggest franchises. Xbox users are gamers, people who got an Xbox to play games like Halo. When Microsoft was under pressure from PS4’s lower price, they unbundled Kinect and collapsed that system to compete. We come into this space without any of those existing customers. We decided from the ground up to serve motion gaming. The design of our device, the pricing, how we use one camera to track multiple people, moving sensors into software and AI—it’s all about keeping it affordable with a subscription service that takes care of the whole family. Why did you build a dedicated device after starting with mobile apps? Before we built Nex Playground, we were building motion games on phones. What we discovered is that when we create dedicated hardware instead, we have a much deeper relationship with customers. When there’s a device where the only thing it does is bring the family together to play active games, it shows big potential. When you use your TV for a motion-game experience, you pay much more attention to it than you would to a game on your phone. The experience is a lot better, and customers love it more. How are families using Nex in ways you didn’t expect? When we started searching for customers and building our Facebook community, which now has over 20,000 people, we discovered new use cases. We found that when kids come back from school, we have a half-hour where they just play. On weekends, they play when friends come over. [Photo: Nex] We’ve also found that when kids are at school, parents want fitness experiences for themselves. Even grandparents derive benefits when they have something to do with their body. We’re defining what role we play for different people in the family, delivering benefits at different times of day, different days of the week, even different seasons of the year. In summer when kids are off school, we can occupy them and get them moving and learning. What’s your approach to developing games in a saturated market? We’re focusing on safety, privacy, and security first since we’re serving families. We have our first-party teams building games, but we also work with ten studio deals already, with seven games launched. We bring in partners whose games we like, and we share revenue with them. We want to keep our model simple—we have our subscription model and want to supply and delight users all year. We don’t want to open the system to many games that might be low quality. We’re curating a set of content and working with developers who are passionate about creating great things. Our business model is simple, honest, and sustainable—no ads, no in-app purchases. The moment you open to third parties, they think about different ways to make money. For families, we don’t want to overwhelm them—we just want to serve them really well. How do you keep up with hardware competition? We think about our hardware in a similar way to how Amazon thinks about the Kindle or Apple thinks about the iPad. Every year, we want to do something better to create perfect experiences. For example, we improved the remote control from 2023 to 2024. We learned that the joystick was a little hard for young kids to use—I saw my daughter struggling to press it—so we made it simpler. [Photo: Nex] We’re always looking at what problems people face and how to improve. The hardware cycle is yearly, and we might be able to do something new each year. But we’re not thinking about something dramatically different—we have a pretty good long trajectory ahead. A lot of improvements actually come through software. With the same hardware, you get access to new technology we develop as detection technologies get better. We don’t want to force customers to buy new hardware to play something new. We think about compatibility and how not to fully obsolete customers. This is a device that can serve your family for years to come. Given how much attention is paid to Nintendo’s new Switch, how are people discovering Nex? According to our surveys, roughly 40% of customers hear about us from friends and families. The next-largest segment, about 20%, comes from our online ads. Another 13% first see us in retail stores. Currently, we’re in 700 Target stores, 100 Walmart locations, and 200 Best Buy stores. This year, we have a national retail expansion to over 5,000 stores. Amazon is also now recognizing us as a new gaming system category—if you look at Amazon video games, they put Nex Playground right next to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch as top-level tabs, even though we’re way smaller than any of them. What’s your long-term vision for Nex? We want to keep kids active, bring families together, and even help keep elderly people active so they can stay independent. We want to tie your family together locally and remotely. We’re happy seeing more grandparents buying Nex for their grandkids and then saying “I want one too.”",

This new Copilot is designed to \"rapidly channel an organization's knowledge into a Copilot that can 'talk,' 'think,' and 'work' like the tenant itself,\" according to an April 14 email sent by Microsoft executive Jay Parikh.A \"tenant\" is the term used to describe corporate users of the Microsoft 365 suite of business applications. A Copilot that has access to these tenants would essentially be able to access customer information stored within their Microsoft 365 accounts.Parikh explained in the email that Microsoft is using different AI techniques to power the Tenant Copilot feature. Supervised fine-tuning helps \"to capture a tenant's voice.\" The tool will also tap into OpenAI's o3 reasoning model \"to shape its thought process.\" Lastly, \"agentic\" fine-tuning will \"empower real-world tasks,\" he wrote.Microsoft at the time planned to offer a public preview of Tenant Copilot at Build, according to the memo.

In the email to the nearly 10,000 employees in the organization, Parikh discussed a new \"Agent Factory\" concept. That's likely a nod to cofounder Bill Gates, who talked about Microsoft being a \"software factory.\"\"Building our vision demands this type of culture — one where Al is embedded in how we think, design, and deliver,\" Parikh wrote. \"The Agent Factory reflects this shift — not just in what we build, but in how we build it together.

U.K. payments company allpay is using artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud intelligence to position it well for future growth. After adopting an AI coding assistant and migrating its systems to the cloud through Microsoft Azure, the FinTech provider saw a 10% boost in coding productivity and a 25% increase in production releases in just nine months — surpassing its total output from the previous year. “At the same time as getting codes out the door faster, GitHub Copilot is helping us to raise the quality of code, testing and applications,” Nick Woolley, IT director at allpay, said in a blog post. Allpay, which has processed payments since 1994, made these changes as part of its wider digital transformation strategy after the company realized its legacy data center infrastructure could not support its growth plans. The migration to the cloud brought scalability, compliance and U.K. data residency, all critical for a regulated firm, according to allpay. Allpay uses GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant integrated directly into developers’ workflows, to boost their productivity. “GitHub Copilot is great because it recommends things you potentially haven’t thought about,” said Adam Wheater, principal development chapter lead. “The people who are using it are definitely seeing benefit from it.” The AI tool has improved productivity not only by speeding up coding tasks — such as generating stored procedures in minutes instead of hours — but also by enhancing code quality and reducing defects. “The amount of time we are spending on rework and defect fixing has dropped,” Woolley added. “We’re getting fewer incidents.” AI is rewriting the rules of financial services through four emerging themes, including reimagining back-office infrastructure and data readiness, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Payment Execs on Agentic AI: ‘The Back Office Will Never Be the Same.’” The other three themes are agentic AI already having an impact in payments and financial services, its capacity for scaling and automating processes and experimentation driving customer-centric innovation. Read more: Payment Execs on Agentic AI: ‘The Back Office Will Never Be the Same’ Modernizing Processes With AI The shift has also improved the developer experience, especially for junior staff. “Whereas previously people would have got stuck or had to go find help by asking another developer or an online search, now we just ask GitHub Copilot,” Wheater said. “It’s like pair programming.” GitHub Copilot’s ability to explain legacy code has become particularly valuable. The AI coding assistant “helps people touching legacy code understand it better, especially when the people who originally wrote the code have moved on,” Wheater said. The integration with Azure tooling has also enabled more robust DevOps practices. “We’ve set up automated delivery pipelines with unit tests on them and we’ve made a big push with infrastructure as code,” Woolley said. As a rural U.K. employer, allpay sees its cutting-edge tech stack as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining developers. “We’re always looking for accelerators or anything that gives us a leg up when it comes to recruitment. Providing a modern working environment and using a cutting-edge toolset helps,” Woolley said. Beyond productivity, GitHub Copilot has encouraged more frequent and standardized code reviews. “GitHub Copilot frees up time for frequent code reviews, ensuring standardization and significantly improving code quality,” said Adrian Michalowski, cloud architect at allpay. Developers are also using their freed-up time to experiment with new AI capabilities, including building a solution that uses Azure AI Services to review pull requests. “We’ve now got another layer of AI flagging issues and checking quality as well as the human checks,” Wheater said. By optimizing workflows and embracing AI, allpay is contributing to a broader digital economy narrative where intelligent automation is central to innovation, cost-efficiency and speed. “GitHub Copilot is another tool in our armory which supports us to get incremental changes out faster so we can deliver value to the business faster,” Woolley said. The company continues to explore ways to extend the benefits of AI and cloud. “We’re trying to use all the tooling available to us to deliver a better service internally and to our customers,” Woolley added. Allpay’s experiences dovetail with PYMNTS data that shows most CFOs say their companies have seen a good return on their investment in AI. In fact, the executives say they’ve also seen expanded use cases. The post Allpay Says AI Transformation Boosts Productivity, Software Releases appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Over 40% of the people laid off were in software engineering, making it by far the largest category, Bloomberg found based on state filings. Relatively few sales or marketing positions were affected, Bloomberg added. To be fair, coders are a big chunk of Microsoft’s workforce, although it doesn’t disclose the exact proportion.

        "description": "Surface Laptop Studio 2 is reportedly no longer being manufactured. Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay left the company for Amazon in late 2023, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New smaller versions of both of these mainstays were introduced just a couple of weeks ago. But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge reports that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold. Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with its six-year support lifecycle for Surface hardware.Read full article Comments",

Plenty of students do use LLMs as homework help machines, rather than slogging through the work themselves. The current way that students are using AI to cut corners, Hoffman said, is circumventing the \"whole point\" of the educational system: learning.\"Obviously a student goes, 'Huh, I could spend 30 hours writing an essay, or I could spend 90 minutes with my ChatGPT, Claude, Pi — whatever — prompting and generate something for that,'\" Hoffman said. \"And obviously, to some degree, they're underserving what they actually really need.\"The LinkedIn cofounder isn't an advocate for keeping AI out of schools — on the contrary, he believes there are ways in which it could aid learning, rather than kneecapping it. For instance, he thinks integrating AI into the curriculum could be more helpful than trying to stave off student usage.\"Whether it's an essay or an oral exam or anything else — you're going to go in and the AI examiner is going to be with you doing that,\" Hoffman said. \"And actually, in fact, that will be harder to fake than the pre-AI times.\"Prior to the advent of AI, Hoffman said, ways to \"hack\" the educational system already existed, such as piling on just enough knowledge to pass a written test or rushing to complete a passable essay that didn't dive much deeper than surface level. Potential AI examiners aside, Hoffman suggests that assessments like oral tests, which he believes are more difficult than written, could force students to study more intensely and absorb more overall.\"Part of the reason why oral exams are hard — generally reserved for Ph.D. students, sometimes master's students, et cetera — is because actually, in fact, to be prepared for oral exams, you got to be across the whole zoom,\" Hoffman said.\"Now, let's think if every class had an oral exam essentially on it,\" he added. \"Ooh, you're going to have to learn a whole lot more in order to do this. And I think that's ultimately how this stuff will be.\"There are also less drastic ways that teachers could be using AI to their advantage, Hoffman added, that don't require them to entirely rewrite their curriculums. For instance, if they believe that AI essays are subpar, they can provide students with examples of what not to do.\"Alright, so you're teaching a class on Jane Austen and her relevance to, call it, early literary criticism, or something like that,\" he said. \"And you say, 'Okay, well I went to ChatGPT and I generated 10 essays, and here's the 10. These are D minuses. Do better.'\"The most important thing, Hoffman said, is that teachers bring AI into the classroom in some way, big or small, if only to gain a better understanding of how it can be applied in their fields.

Microsoft said Monday (May 12) that it will retire Bing Search APIs on Aug. 11. “Any existing instances of Bing Search APIs will be decommissioned completely, and the product will no longer be available for usage or new customer signup,” the company said in an Azure Update. Microsoft suggested in the update that customers may consider as an alternative Grounding with Bing Search as part of Azure AI Agents. “Grounding with Bing Search allows Azure AI Agents to incorporate real-time public web data when generating responses with an LLM,” the update said. Bing Search APIs supply software developers with a raw feed of Bing search results, Wired reported Wednesday (May 14). The product’s users include search engines that pay a fee to Microsoft and present the Bing search results to their own users. By limiting access to this search data, Microsoft is shifting its focus to chatbots, as Grounding with Bing Search is a service that enables chatbots to add real-time public web data to their AI-generated responses, according to the report. The new AI-powered system provides summaries rather than raw search results, per the report. Microsoft spokesperson Donny Turnbaugh told Wired that the company’s pivot to this newer offering “better meets market demand for having AI solutions” and that Microsoft has a “support plan in place” for customers affected by the change. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in April 2023 that generative AI had triggered a “generational shift” in web search. Speaking of the state of web search and AI features Microsoft had added at the time, Nadella said that “when people use these new AI features, their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up. As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business models and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.” On May 5, it was reported that Microsoft’s strategy to install AI as a default feature in its software may be paying off, as the company saw a 10% rise in revenue from consumer subscriptions to Office 365 in the three months ending in March compared to a year ago.

Async use of C++ is a big deal because we are all increasingly needing to do things concurrently and in parallel. [Editor's note: \"async\" is shorthand for asynchronous — code that can run in the background without freezing your app. It's a new framework that helps developers write faster, smoother programs by handling tasks like downloading files or crunching numbers without making users wait.]I didn't realize until I joined Citadel Securities just how much that framework is already used at the firm, including for our US equities trading. Working at Citadel Securities is almost like living in the future in that we're already diving deep into technologies that will eventually be widely used. That's been a lot of fun.Citadel Securities' Herb SutterCitadel SecuritiesWhat exactly is an async framework, and why is it becoming increasingly important to have things work concurrently and in parallel?Concurrency is the idea of doing more than one thing at a time, which we're always trying to do in a network-cloud world, whether that's waiting for cloud capacity or AI tokens. Parallelism is when you have one huge computation to do, but would like to spread elements out over multiple machines to get the answer more quickly.What impresses me most about C++26's async framework is that it can handle both of those elements — the one that involves hiding and waiting, and the other that's doing many different things. Those are such different things. Doing them both well in one framework is pretty amazing.Just think of what a trading system has to do. Requests for trades are flying across the wire all the time. You never know when the client is going to want to buy or sell, so as a market maker, you have to be ready at all times. And that means being very responsive, very efficient, and super fast. Execution is extremely important, and that's why we're investing in the async framework. What are some of the advantages that you're seeing being an early adopter or a first mover in this new C++ standard?At Citadel Securities, using the things today that everyone else is going to be using months or years from now builds muscle and familiarity — especially for something as core as an async framework. Beyond that, we have been providing feedback and suggesting tweaks to the standard that are being adopted. Because we're using the new standard in production and at scale, we're able to play a role in evolving the language, which has been great.How would a prospective hire show off their C++ skills? One way you can show off your C++ skills is simply by talking about what you're looking forward to most in C++26, describing the features that have helped you, or sharing something you've learned recently. I want to know that you're that curious and that you're focused on continuous learning, and that's true more generally, regardless of language. It's important to be able to demonstrate curiosity and knowledge about software advancements — and to show that you understand that there's more than one tool out there and that you know how to use them together. What's your advice to young engineers interested in joining Citadel Securities?I would encourage young engineers to get as much work experience as possible as early as possible. I went to the University of Waterloo in Canada, which has a well-known co-op program that served me incredibly well, but there are many others out there.The key is to get some work experience so that by the time you graduate, you have spent a significant amount of time using your skills in a real-world environment. The biggest differentiator we see among candidates is their ability to use technology to solve commercial problems. Ultimately, knowing data structures, languages, and the like are important tools in the toolkit, but what will really set you apart is your ability to solve business problems.Read the original article on Business Insider Herb Sutter joined Citadel Securities in 2024 from Microsoft to spearhead its training initiatives on C++.Citadel SecuritiesHerb Sutter joined Citadel Securities in 2024 as a technical fellow, after 20 years at Microsoft.He details how the firm is using a new version of C++.Sutter also talks about how job applicants can stand out.You may think that coding languages are static, just a string of letters and numbers for humans to communicate with machines and software.

We've known for months now that Valve is expanding its Linux-based SteamOS operating system beyond the Steam Deck to other handheld PCs, starting with some versions of the Asus ROG Ally. This week, Valve began making some changes to its Steam storefront to prepare for a future when the Deck isn't the only hardware running SteamOS. A new \"SteamOS Compatible\" label will begin rolling out \"over the next few weeks\" to denote \"whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS,\" including \"game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support.\" Games that don't meet this requirement will be marked as \"SteamOS Unsupported.\" As with current games and the Steam Deck, this label doesn't mean these games won't run, but it does mean there may be some serious compatibility issues that keep the game from running as intended. Valve says that \"over 18,000 titles on Steam [will] be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate,\" and that game developers won't need to do anything extra to earn the label if their titles already support the Steam Deck.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Updated Start menu design is currently being tested in Windows Insider previews. Microsoft put a lot of focus on Windows 11's design when it released the operating system in 2021, making a clean break with the design language of Windows 10 (which had, itself, simply tweaked and adapted Windows 8's design language from 2012). Since then, Microsoft has continued to modify the software's design in bits and pieces, both for individual apps and for foundational UI elements like the Taskbar, system tray, and Windows Explorer. Microsoft is currently testing a redesigned version of the Windows 11 Start menu, one that reuses most of the familiar elements from the current design but reorganizes them and gives users a few additional customization options. On its Microsoft Design blog today, the company walked through the new design and showed some of the ideas that were tried and discarded in the process. This discarded Start menu design toyed with an almost Windows XP-ish left-hand sidebar, among other elements. Credit: Microsoft Some designs brings to mind the full-screen Start experience of Windows 8. Credit: Microsoft Another big design with acres of icons and more space dedicated to non-app-icons. Credit: Microsoft This design included thumbnail previews for recently opened files. Credit: Microsoft Another discarded Start menu design. Credit: Microsoft Microsoft says it tested its menu designs with \"over 300 Windows 11 fans\" in unmoderated studies, \"and dozens more\" in \"live co-creation calls.\" These testers' behavior and reactions informed what Microsoft kept and what it discarded.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "On Tuesday, Microsoft said it is cutting less than 3% of its global workforce, including LinkedIn. The company which an estimated 228,000 employees as of last June, meaning the layoffs will affect approximately 6,000 employees. The tech giant, which makes popular software products Windows and Word, will make cuts across various locations, teams, and roles. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Fast Company. The news comes less than two weeks after the Redmond, Washington-based company beat first quarter earnings expectations, driven by its Azure cloud business. It also issued strong guidance going forward, despite President’s Trump’s tariffs and overall economic uncertainty. Microsoft also said it invested heavily in AI infrastructure during the first quarter of 2025. Microsoft said that it regularly adjusts its workforce to meet the strategic demands of the business, and that by reducing layers with fewer managers, the company hopes to increase agility and enhance efficiency by minimizing redundancy and streamlining processes, procedures, and roles. It also said the cuts will let employees spend more time leveraging new technologies and capabilities. On Tuesday, a number of LinkedIn employees posted about the reported layoffs on LinkedIn. The layoffs would be the largest at the company since 2023, when Microsoft eliminated 10,000 jobs, and follows a small round of performance-based layoffs at the beginning of 2025. However, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC the upcoming layoffs are not performance based. CEO Satya Nadella previously said Microsoft planned to spend $80 billion on data centers for artificial intelligence workloads in 2025, which could be even more costly with tariffs. Microsoft isn’t the only tech company to make cuts since the beginning of this year. A number of high-profile technology giants have been trimming their ranks, including Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms cut about 5% of its workforce—roughly 3,600 employees—in February, and Amazon announced it was laying off dozens at the end of January.",

Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its workforce, or about 6,000 employees, to reduce the number of management layers. The job cuts are not performance-related, CNBC reported Tuesday (May 13), citing a Microsoft spokesperson. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said, according to the report. This round of layoffs will affect employees across all levels, teams and geographies, the report said. It will be Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since 2023, when the company eliminated 10,000 roles, and will follow a small number of cuts made in January that the firm said were performance-based, per the report. Microsoft said April 30 that it will continue investing in capital expenditures throughout its fiscal year 2026 after seeing its cloud and artificial intelligence offerings lead its revenue gains in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. “These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead,” Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said during the company’s quarterly earnings call. It was reported in January that Microsoft planned to pause hiring in part of its U.S. consulting business and lay off less than 1% of its workforce. The hiring pause was part of the consulting division’s efforts to manage costs. The division also instructed employees to use remote sessions instead of travel for internal meetings, have executives authorize trips to customers’ sites, and make 35% cuts in marketing and nonbillable external resource spend. When the company announced in January 2023 that it was laying off 10,000 workers, or about 5% of its workforce at the time, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company was seeing “significant” changes as customers optimized their digital spend to do more with less. Microsoft cut about 1% of its staff in 2022 as part of a broader push to reduce expenses that also included a hiring freeze, as well as efforts to get staff to scale back on spending on things like travel, training and company events.

        "description": "Windows 10 will stop getting free security updates on October 14, 2025. For most users, Windows 10 will stop receiving security updates and other official support from Microsoft on October 14, 2025, about five months from today. Until recently, Microsoft had also said that users running the Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 would also lose support on that date, whether they were using the continually updated Microsoft 365 versions of those apps or the buy-once-own-forever versions included in Office 2021 or Office 2024. Microsoft has recently tweaked this policy, however (as seen by The Verge). Now, Windows 10 users of the Microsoft 365 apps will still be eligible to receive software updates and support through October of 2028, \"in the interest of maintaining your security while you upgrade to Windows 11.\" Microsoft is taking a similar approach to Windows Defender malware definitions, which will be offered to Windows 10 users \"through at least October 2028.\" The policy is a change from a few months ago, when Microsoft insisted that Office apps running on Windows 10 would become officially unsupported on October 14. The perpetually licensed versions of Office will be supported in accordance with Microsoft's \"Fixed Lifecycle Policy,\" which guarantees support and security updates for a fixed number of years after a software product's initial release. For Office 2021, this means Windows 10 users will get support through October of 2026; for Office 2024, this should extend to October of 2029.Read full article Comments",

Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaMax Cherney/REUTERSMicrosoft plans to cut around 6,000 jobs, less than 3% of its global workforce.The cuts aim to reduce middle managers and increase coders versus non-coders as BI earlier reported.Tech industry trends show a shift toward fewer managers, as seen with Amazon and Google.Microsoft plans to cut less than 3% of its global workforce, or around 6,000 employees, with notifications beginning May 13, the company confirmed.A person familiar with the cuts said some affected employees will stay on the payroll for 60 days and will still be eligible for rewards and bonuses. Microsoft's spokesperson has yet to comment on or confirm these terms.As Business Insider reported last month, these cuts are intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders versus non-coders on projects. Microsoft organizations want to increase their \"span of control,\" or the number of employees who report to each manager. A spokesperson said these latest cuts are not performance-driven.Across the tech industry, there's already a culling of middle managers underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.Microsoft is also trying to decrease the \"PM ratio\" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.Have a tip?

        "description": "AI integration remains a top priority across enterprises worldwide, yet success remains elusive despite widespread enthusiasm and significant investment. An October 2024 study by Boston Consulting Group found that only 26% of companies have derived measurable business value from their AI initiatives. As a result, CEOs face mounting pressure to deliver tangible ROI, shifting focus from experimentation to real-world outcomes. Modern AI development increasingly relies on open-source foundations, enabling rapid iteration and innovation. Many transformative breakthroughs have emerged from community-driven development—primarily in Python, the dominant language in data science. However, as enterprises attempt to operationalize these advances, foundational cracks are becoming harder to ignore. Fragmented toolchains, limited oversight, and inconsistent practices introduce significant vulnerabilities at scale. Security, in particular, is a growing concern. Over half (58%) of organizations use open-source components in at least half of their AI and ML projects, yet nearly a third (29%) cite security risks as their biggest challenge with open-source tools. These are precisely the gaps Anaconda aims to close with its new Anaconda AI Platform, a unified system designed to bring structure, clarity, and control to the chaotic open-source AI development landscape. Founded in 2012 in Austin, Texas, as Continuum Analytics by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant, Anaconda now supports more than 50 million users globally. As the longtime steward of the most widely used Python distribution—trusted by 94% of the Fortune 500—Anaconda holds a uniquely strategic position. “Since ChatGPT put large language models on the map, enterprises have been eager to own their destiny in AI,” Peter Wang, chief AI and Innovation officer and cofounder of Anaconda, tells Fast Company. “Enterprise-grade AI workflows naturally break down into a few key steps, each of which can be streamlined and handled in a structured way.” Wang explained these steps include managing open-source Python libraries, tracking model weights, and continuously evaluating model performance. “Right now, AI teams are stitching together ad hoc solutions to solve each piece,” he added. “The Anaconda AI Platform offers a unified foundation, an integrated stack that supports the entire AI lifecycle. It eliminates the need for disconnected tools and duct-tape integrations.” The platform arrives at a pivotal moment as organizations seek structure around open-source AI development. Wang described it as a centralized control plane for AI workflows, streamlining processes from sandboxed development to enterprise-scale deployment. It enables teams to “develop once, deploy anywhere,” whether in the cloud, on-premise, or in sovereign data environments—without reengineering from scratch. “Every decision we make in product update, new feature, or change—is with the intent of furthering the advancement and democratization of data science and AI for all,” Wang says. “Python is currently the developer language of choice for AI programming, and our new platform aims to make it easier for community members and enterprises alike to innovate freely with AI and without compromising security or compliance.” As models grow more complex and regulations tighten, organizations need full visibility into their AI systems. Beyond its bold vision, the Anaconda AI Platform offers practical features like real-time governance, role-based access control, command-line integration, automated error correction, and pre-validated package security. These capabilities aim to reduce broken environments, improve deployment safety, and support better collaboration across distributed teams. “Data scientists can continue to work in the tools they know and trust, while the Anaconda AI platform manages the complex orchestration of management and dependency resolution into invisible infrastructure rather than daily friction,” says Wang. “Our goal is to break down long-standing silos between data scientists, machine learning engineers, and operations teams, so that everyone works from a shared source of truth with full visibility into an AI model’s lifecycle, from development through deployment.” A GitHub Moment for Open-Source AI Development? Just as GitHub centralized version control and collaboration in software development, the Anaconda AI Platform offers a similar home base for open-source AI in the enterprise. “While the GitHub analogy is compelling, in reality, what we’re building goes much deeper,” Wang says. “AI development through open source faces pain points that consistently hinder progress across AI, ML, and data science teams in large organizations. We’re addressing those day-to-day challenges to ensure that innovation can scale without friction.” The platform’s unified CLI authentication simplifies access across the Anaconda ecosystem with single sign-on. Previously, users had to manually manage tokens and settings across tools. Now, they authenticate once for seamless access. For enterprise administrators, role-based access controls ensure that only the right people access critical resources, balancing governance with innovation. Additionally, the Quick Start Environments feature offers preconfigured workspaces tailored for specific use cases like finance or AI/ML, eliminating setup hassles and enabling immediate productivity. This significantly improves onboarding, allowing new team members to contribute on day one. “A technical director at a financial services company told us this eliminated a one-month turnaround time for package approvals, creating a much more fluid development experience,” Wang tells Fast Company. “Likewise, an industrial customer shared that they’ve been able to reduce the equivalent of two full-time employees previously dedicated to manual package management and approval workflows.” Anaconda standardizes access to thousands of secure open-source packages, allowing organizations to transition away from legacy data analytics tools. “By automating vulnerability scanning, package vetting, and security policy enforcement, we eliminate the risks traditionally associated with downloading open-source packages,” Wang adds. “This level of security results in 60% fewer breach risks when developing with Anaconda.” Building a Responsible Foundation for Enterprises As AI becomes embedded in enterprise infrastructure, organizations are no longer just choosing models—they’re choosing ecosystems. Wang noted that speed alone won’t define success in enterprise AI; true success lies in scaling open innovation while maintaining control. “AI shouldn’t be the exclusive domain of hyperscalers or tech giants. By providing the tools that make open source AI both secure and scalable, we’re empowering organizations of all sizes to participate in this transformation,” he added. “The future of AI isn’t just about technological capability—it’s about responsible stewardship of these powerful tools.” With its scale and trust, Anaconda may well become the GitHub of AI, offering centralized control and enterprise-grade security without stifling the innovation that makes open-source ecosystems thrive. Wang believes that open source is the ideal foundation for accelerating AI innovation. “When teams can deploy solutions consistently across environments without rework, they deliver value faster,” Wang says. “We want everyone to reap the benefits of open source, as open innovation leads to the boldest of breakthroughs.”",

When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, it likely didn’t expect that the fledgling artificial intelligence (AI) research lab would become the juggernaut that it is today. That all changed when ChatGPT became a household word in 2022. But that also means the agreement it first struck with the startup, which was a nonprofit back then, would one day inevitably change. That is what’s going on today. The FT is reporting that Microsoft and OpenAI are renegotiating their partnership deal to one in which the software giant would protect its equity stake while ensuring access to future technologies. OpenAI gets more flexibility, with a possible IPO in its future. “The altering of Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership to allow for an initial public offering is a big step for the AI pioneer,” Samuel Kerr, global head of equity capital markets at data provider MergerMarket, told PYMNTS. “In this new wave of artificial intelligence investing, there are few more prized IPO candidates than OpenAI.” While there’s more work for OpenAI to do before an IPO, the AI startup would be a “pure play way to invest in LLM [large language models] innovation on the public markets,” Kerr said, adding that among the private AI leaders, OpenAI “remains one of the most attractive due to ChatGPT.” “A public listing for OpenAI, and perhaps even listings by its competitors like xAI or Anthropic, would allow retail investors to back new digital champions, give access to new pools of investment capital for future growth and allow for monetization opportunities for early backers,” Kerr said. Microsoft’s first investment in OpenAI was for $1 billion. In return, Microsoft became OpenAI’s sole cloud provider and would have access to its technologies short of full artificial general intelligence (AGI). This same year, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary whose profits are capped. Microsoft’s investment would become prescient after ChatGPT became the leading AI chatbot in the world. The company would further invest in OpenAI for a reported total of about $13 billion. It also held an equity stake in OpenAI and would share in any profits from the startup. But the escalating cost of AI model training and infrastructure made OpenAI reconsider its capped-profit structure, since venture capitalists balked at giving billions of dollars if their profits would be limited.

OpenAI wanted to convert itself into a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC), which doesn’t have a capped profit unit but has a public good mandate; the nonprofit would be an arm of the PBC. Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, sued to stop it from becoming a for-profit company. Later, after consulting with the attorneys general of California and Delaware as well as civic leaders, OpenAI said it would keep its nonprofit parent and convert the capped profit entity to a PBC. Musk vowed to continue suing, his attorney has told PYMNTS. While the corporate structure fight has been going on, OpenAI has become a competitor of Microsoft, rolling out its own consumer applications, developer tools and infrastructure. It’s no longer just a research lab anymore. The hiring of Instacart CEO Fidji Sumo further cemented OpenAI’s commercial focus. Here are some ways in which Microsoft and OpenAI compete: ChatGPT competes with Microsoft Copilot. OpenAI’s API competes with Azure’s OpenAI services platform. OpenAI is building its own data centers; Microsoft already has a big data center footprint. OpenAI is signing up enterprise deals with Fortune 500 companies, the same thing that Microsoft is doing. Roman Eloshvili, CEO of ComplyControl, an AI-powered risk management company, told PYMNTS that it’s not unusual for tech companies to “struggle when trying to balance profit with purpose, but OpenAI’s case may well demonstrate that it’s possible. That you can go big, raise serious funds, and still position yourself as mission-driven.” If OpenAI succeeds in balancing both, “the ripple effects across the tech industry are going to be significant, helping set new standards for other companies and startups,” Eloshvili said. For Microsoft, the restructured deal is a trade-off. Giving up equity in exchange for long-term access to OpenAI’s tech secures its future access to cutting-edge AI solutions for many years ahead. “It ensures that the company has a seat at the table in the rapidly developing AI landscape without needing to outright control OpenAI,” Eloshvili said. “Strategically speaking, it’s a smart move.” For now, Microsoft is a key holdout to OpenAI’s restructuring plan, according to FT. A critical issue in the negotiations is how much equity Microsoft will receive in the restructured company. The original contract runs until 2030. Microsoft is willing to give up some equity in exchange for access to any new OpenAI tech beyond 2030.

OpenAI is reportedly in the middle of reworking its multibillion-dollar agreement with Microsoft. The negotiated deal would allow the artificial intelligence (AI) company to someday launch an initial public offering (IPO), while protecting Microsoft’s access to AI models, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (May 11). As that report noted, Microsoft is a crucial holdout to OpenAI’s plans to restructure itself and move away from its nonprofit roots. OpenAI recently abandoned a plan that would have taken away control of the company from its nonprofit board, while still sticking to plans for its business arm to become a public benefit corporation (PBC). This, the FT said, would allow it to turn a profit while still focusing on the original goal of AI to benefit humanity. One of the key issues in these discussions is how much equity in a restructured OpenAI Microsoft will get in exchange for the $13 billion-plus it has invested in the startup, the report said. Multiple sources with knowledge of the negotiations told the FT the companies are also revising the terms of a larger contract, formed when Microsoft first invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. In its current iteration, that contract runs to 2030 and covers what access Microsoft has to OpenAI’s intellectual property and revenue sharing from product sales. Sources said Microsoft would be willing to give up some of its equity stake in OpenAI’s new for-profit business in exchange for access to technology developed after 2030. The sources also say the negotiations are being complicated by a cooling relationship between the two companies. PYMNTS spoke last week with legal experts on OpenAI’s planned PBC shift. Marcus Wolter, partner and global director of corporate practice at the law firm Caldwell, said the PBC structure is an improvement. “For OpenAI, it is still a better situation,” Wolter said. “They will be able to raise capital more easily and, as a public benefit company, they are merely required to balance the impact of the actions taken with the interests of all stakeholders and not just shareholders.” In a separate report, PYMNTS examined OpenAI’s ambitions beyond AI models following its hiring of Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications. “This is a power move,” said Jeanel Alvarado, CEO of research firm Retailboss. “The CEO of Instacart has a track record of building killer consumer apps. OpenAI is walking straight into Google’s backyard and challenging Google’s search, ads and AI-powered tools.” The post OpenAI and Microsoft Reportedly Rework Pact Ahead of Possible IPO appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Top executives from OpenAI, Microsoft, AMD and CoreWeave urged lawmakers at a U.S. Senate hearing Thursday (May 8) to support the nation’s artificial intelligence efforts through “light-touch” regulations. “The stakes could not be higher — and Congress is right that the United States must lead the way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in Washington, D.C. The hearing, “Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation,” revealed the companies’ common priorities to accelerate infrastructure investment; build a skilled AI workforce, including high-skilled immigration; and speed up permitting for power plants. In a largely chummy hearing — at one point a senator informally called Altman “Sam” instead of “Mr. Altman” — lawmakers asked the executives what the government can do to stay ahead in AI and keep China at bay. Altman said a “light-touch regulatory framework,” initiatives to support AI infrastructure and supply chains, the easing of the permitting process and getting more energy online are things the tech sector needs. “We’ll need your help,” Altman told Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, who made a pitch for AI data center investments in his state. Microsoft President Brad Smith said clarifying rules around data used for training would be helpful. There have been several lawsuits over copyrighted material being used for AI training without compensation to the creators. Smith gave the example of Shakespeare’s literary works. People read Shakespeare and are inspired by the Bard to create their own content. Such content should be “fair use” for AI model training. Read also: AI Regulations in States Shift to Pro-Innovation, Not Risk Mitigation China Under the Microscope Throughout the hearing, a recurring concern among senators was China gaining on the U.S. in the AI race and the implications that would have on geopolitics. Altman said the future can be “almost unimaginably bright, but only if we take concrete steps to ensure that an American-led version of AI, built on democratic values like freedom and transparency, prevails over an authoritarian one.” Lisa Su, CEO of chipmaker AMD, warned that “leadership is not guaranteed.” For example, Su said chip export controls that affect AMD and its rivals may slow AI development in adversarial nations, but people will make do with what they have and still advance in AI. The President Joe Biden administration restricted advanced chip AI exports primarily to China to slow that nation’s AI development. The President Donald Trump administration is revisiting those rules, delaying implementation, Reuters reported. Microsoft’s Smith said exports must be regulated with the right controls because if allied countries cannot get American technology, they will get it elsewhere. The “No. 1 factor” in determining which country leads in AI is “whose technology is more broadly adopted by the rest of the world,” Smith said. Su agreed. “If our international partners cannot access U.S. platforms, they will adopt alternatives that may be less advanced today but will mature over time,” she said. Michael Intrator, CEO of cloud GPU provider CoreWeave, said poorly crafted restrictions could “inadvertently bolster foreign competitors.” He called for rules that foster international cooperation rather than fragmenting the global AI market. “AI represents the next major evolution of technology with the potential to transform society,” Intrator said. “This is America’s AI moment, and a strategic opportunity America cannot afford to miss.” See also: AI Regulations: OpenAI Calls on EU to Review, Simplify AI Rules Powering the AI Economy Each executive stressed that massive computing power is the bedrock of AI progress — and the U.S. must expand its data center capacity, power grid and chip supply. “AI computation is energy-intensive,” Intrator said, citing U.S. Department of Energy forecasts that data centers could consume up to 12% of the nation’s electricity by 2028. “Every month of delay represents lost ground in a field where the pace of innovation is measured in weeks, not years.” Smith said Microsoft is investing over $80 billion this year in AI infrastructure, with more than half going to U.S. projects. “Just as you can’t have reliable electricity in your home without a powerplant, you can’t have AI without data centers and AI infrastructure,” he said. All four executives said the talent gap could become a major chokepoint for U.S. competitiveness. Altman said OpenAI’s models are already helping students and educators in states like Texas and North Carolina, with one-third of college-aged users in the U.S. relying on ChatGPT for tutoring and learning. “AI will be vitally important to ensuring that today’s students are ready for tomorrow’s jobs,” he said. Smith called for a national goal to make AI literacy accessible to all Americans, especially through partnerships with K-12 schools, community colleges and trade programs. “Perhaps the single biggest challenge for data center expansion in the United States is a national shortage of people,” Smith said. “Over the next decade, the U.S. will need to recruit and train half a million new electricians to meet the country’s growing electricity needs.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Think Apple and Microsoft, Coke and Pepsi, McDonald’s and Burger King and many other famous pairings. It’s because a dose of healthy competition ultimately benefits the end consumer, and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the ongoing battle between retail titans Walmart and Amazon. The two mega retailers have evolved far beyond price wars and delivery speed, although those twin pillars remain key goals, and competition today plays out across artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, and omnichannel ecosystems. It can frequently result in new strategies that have the potential to redefine the very fabric of commerce. Robotics Come to Life for Retail Operations Amazon continues to push the boundaries of robotic technology with the introduction on Wednesday (May 7) of Vulcan, a fulfillment center robot and Amazon’s first robot equipped with a sense of touch. It can handle approximately 75% of warehouse items, including those that are oddly shaped or fragile, and operates up to 20-hour shifts, assisting human workers by managing tasks that involve reaching high or low shelves, thereby reducing physical strain on employees. The announcement followed reports from February that Amazon aims to glean savings from its robotics efforts as it increases spending on AI. Amazon has deployed over 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers, including autonomous mobile robots like Proteus and robotic arms such as Robin and Cardinal. These systems are integrated with AI to enhance efficiency and safety in operations And while Amazon is launching robots that can feel, Walmart is turning to machines that can build. In a literally groundbreaking move, Walmart partnered with Alquist 3D to construct a 5,000-square-foot warehouse extension in Huntsville, Alabama, using robotic 3D printing technology. Completed in just seven days with a five-person crew, the project underscores the commitment of large retailers to leveraging automation to address labor shortages and accelerate construction timelines. Retail Footprints Still Matter Both companies are building for the future. In the U.S., Walmart has unveiled its first new Supercenter in Cypress, Texas, after a four-year hiatus — a 170,000-square-foot “Store of the Future” that blends physical retail with digital innovation. This flagship location is part of a broader plan to build or convert over 150 stores and remodel 650 more, integrating features like expanded departments, private pharmacy screening rooms, and enhanced online pickup and delivery services. Also in the U.S, Walmart is reinforcing its dedication to American manufacturing through initiatives like the “Grow with US” program, designed to assist small businesses in navigating the complexities of retail. These efforts align with Walmart’s pledge to invest an additional $350 billion in U.S.-made products by 2030, aiming to bolster domestic supply chains and create job opportunities. The focus on domestic goods also comes against a backdrop where U.S. tariffs are throwing global supply chains into disarray. Looking abroad, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $4 billion investment to establish its first data centers in Chile, marking its third cloud region in Latin America. This expansion aims to support services like generative AI while addressing environmental concerns through innovative cooling technologies and a commitment to renewable energy. Additionally, Amazon’s latest Alexa+ voice assistant has reached 100,000 users, reflecting the company’s commitment to integrating AI into everyday consumer interactions. Innovating Across an Omnichannel Landscape Consumers expect a future where personalized recommendations, seamless transactions, and rapid fulfillment become standard. And as Amazon’s recent partnership involves delivering pet prescriptions, that promise extends even to Fluffy and Fido and other household pets. For both pets and people, data is becoming table stakes for building better experience. For example Sam’s Club, a Walmart subsidiary, is transforming its Member Access Platform (MAP) into a comprehensive “Retail Experience Network.” By introducing tools like Brand Lift, Customer Lifetime Value measurement, and AI-powered Propensity Modeling, Sam’s Club enables brands to create personalized, omnichannel campaigns that resonate with members both online and in-store. Ultimately, in the intensifying battle for retail dominance, Amazon and Walmart are accelerating innovation across the omnichannel frontier, blending digital convenience with physical presence in ways that reshape consumer expectations. Both giants are converging on a future where retail is channel-agnostic, delivery is instantaneous, and the shopping journey is seamlessly personalized. The arms race is less about stores vs. screens — and more about who can turn both into a single, intelligent system.

        "description": "Discontinuation of 256GB models gives older Surface PCs an effective price hike. When Microsoft announced new Surface devices earlier this week, we noted that there wasn't a lot of daylight between the starting prices of the new but lower-end devices ($799 for the 12-inch Surface Pro, $899 for the 13-inch Surface Laptop) and the starting prices of the older-but-higher-end Surfaces from last spring ($999 for both). It appears Microsoft has quietly solved this problem by discontinuing the 256GB versions of the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 and the 13-inch Surface Pro 11. Microsoft's retail pages for both devices list only 512GB and 1TB configurations, with regular prices starting at $1,199. Though not technically a price hike—the 512GB versions of both devices also cost $1,199 before—it does amount to an effective price increase for last year's Surface hardware, especially given that both devices have user-replaceable storage that can easily be upgraded for less than the $200 that Microsoft charged for the 256GB-to-512GB upgrade. The upshot is that the new Surface PCs make more sense now than they did on Tuesday in relative terms, but it's only because you'll pay more to buy a Surface Pro 11 or Surface Laptop 7 than you would before. The 15-inch version of the Surface Laptop 7 still lists a 256GB configuration and a $1,299 starting price, but the 256GB models are currently out of stock.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Getty Images; Tyler Le/BITech firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards.Top performers are better incentivized, while underachievers face increased scrutiny.Tech companies are also reducing new-hire offers and lowering pay raises.Big Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat.The latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%.The move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams.These companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent.The changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over.\"The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less,\" Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. \"This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers.\"Google declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: \"Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance.\"The new approach \"creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles,\" an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers \"multiple channels\" for employees to raise concerns about pay.'Appropriate distinction'Amazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance.\"Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase,\" one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. \"This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level.\"At Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling.But with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind.\"High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors,\" John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week.Microsoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls \"low performers.\" Managers also received \"more transparency and clarity\" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year.Meta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a \"non-regrettable attrition\" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers—have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired.Lower pay for new hiresWhile these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers.According to Levels.fyi data, Amazon used to regularly offer over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers in 2022. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing \"extra approvals\" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added.Switching jobs no longer helps either.The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023.Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power.Not everyone is sold that the shift to crackdown on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because \"others are doing them,\" cycling through similar changes every decade or so.\"These are just fads,\" Capelli said.Still, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard.\"No raise, no RSUs — thanks!\" they wrote, referring to the lack of employee stock awards, according to a photo of the writing seen by BI. \"Do more with less.\"Have a tip?

SWE-Bench (pronounced “swee bench”) launched in November 2024 to evaluate an AI model’s coding skill, using more than 2,000 real-world programming problems pulled from the public GitHub repositories of 12 different Python-based projects.

SWE-Bench (pronounced “swee bench”) launched in November 2024 to evaluate an AI model’s coding skill, using more than 2,000 real-world programming problems pulled from the public GitHub repositories of 12 different Python-based projects. In the months since then, it’s quickly become one of the most popular tests in AI. A SWE-Bench score has become a mainstay of major model releases from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—and outside of foundation models, the fine-tuners at AI firms are in constant competition to see who can rise above the pack. The top of the leaderboard is a pileup between three different fine tunings of Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet model and Amazon’s Q developer agent. Auto Code Rover—one of the Claude modifications—nabbed the number two spot in November, and was acquired just three months later. Despite all the fervor, this isn’t exactly a truthful assessment of which model is “better.” As the benchmark has gained prominence, “you start to see that people really want that top spot,” says John Yang, a researcher on the team that developed SWE-Bench at Princeton University. As a result, entrants have begun to game the system—which is pushing many others to wonder whether there’s a better way to actually measure AI achievement. Developers of these coding agents aren’t necessarily doing anything as straightforward cheating, but they’re crafting approaches that are too neatly tailored to the specifics of the benchmark. The initial SWE-Bench test set was limited to programs written in Python, which meant developers could gain an advantage by training their models exclusively on Python code. Soon, Yang noticed that high-scoring models would fail completely when tested on different programming languages—revealing an approach to the test that he describes as “gilded.” “It looks nice and shiny at first glance, but then you try to run it on a different language and the whole thing just kind of falls apart,” Yang says. “At that point, you’re not designing a software engineering agent. You’re designing to make a SWE-Bench agent, which is much less interesting.” The SWE-Bench issue is a symptom of a more sweeping—and complicated—problem in AI evaluation, and one that’s increasingly sparking heated debate: The benchmarks the industry uses to guide development are drifting further and further away from evaluating actual capabilities, calling their basic value into question. Making the situation worse, several benchmarks, most notably FrontierMath and Chatbot Arena, have recently come under heat for an alleged lack of transparency. Nevertheless, benchmarks still play a central role in model development, even if few experts are willing to take their results at face value. OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy recently described the situation as “an evaluation crisis”: the industry has fewer trusted methods for measuring capabilities and no clear path to better ones. “Historically, benchmarks were the way we evaluated AI systems,” says Vanessa Parli, director of research at Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. “Is that the way we want to evaluate systems going forward? And if it’s not, what is the way?” A growing group of academics and AI researchers are making the case that the answer is to go smaller, trading sweeping ambition for an approach inspired by the social sciences. Specifically, they want to focus more on testing validity, which for quantitative social scientists refers to how well a given questionnaire measures what it’s claiming to measure—and, more fundamentally, whether what it is measuring has a coherent definition. That could cause trouble for benchmarks assessing hazily defined concepts like “reasoning” or “scientific knowledge”—and for developers aiming to reach the much–hyped goal of artificial general intelligence—but it would put the industry on firmer ground as it looks to prove the worth of individual models. “Taking validity seriously means asking folks in academia, industry, or wherever to show that their system does what they say it does,” says Abigail Jacobs, a University of Michigan professor who is a central figure in the new push for validity. “I think it points to a weakness in the AI world if they want to back off from showing that they can support their claim.” The limits of traditional testing If AI companies have been slow to respond to the growing failure of benchmarks, it’s partially because the test-scoring approach has been so effective for so long. One of the biggest early successes of contemporary AI was the ImageNet challenge, a kind of antecedent to contemporary benchmarks. Released in 2010 as an open challenge to researchers, the database held more than 3 million images for AI systems to categorize into 1,000 different classes. Crucially, the test was completely agnostic to methods, and any successful algorithm quickly gained credibility regardless of how it worked. When an algorithm called AlexNet broke through in 2012, with a then unconventional form of GPU training, it became one of the foundational results of modern AI. Few would have guessed in advance that AlexNet’s convolutional neural nets would be the secret to unlocking image recognition—but after it scored well, no one dared dispute it. (One of AlexNet’s developers, Ilya Sutskever, would go on to cofound OpenAI.) A large part of what made this challenge so effective was that there was little practical difference between ImageNet’s object classification challenge and the actual process of asking a computer to recognize an image. Even if there were disputes about methods, no one doubted that the highest-scoring model would have an advantage when deployed in an actual image recognition system. But in the 12 years since, AI researchers have applied that same method-agnostic approach to increasingly general tasks. SWE-Bench is commonly used as a proxy for broader coding ability, while other exam-style benchmarks often stand in for reasoning ability. That broad scope makes it difficult to be rigorous about what a specific benchmark measures—which, in turn, makes it hard to use the findings responsibly. Where things break down Anka Reuel, a PhD student who has been focusing on the benchmark problem as part of her research at Stanford, has become convinced the evaluation problem is the result of this push toward generality. “We’ve moved from task-specific models to general-purpose models,” Reuel says. “It’s not about a single task anymore but a whole bunch of tasks, so evaluation becomes harder.” Like the University of Michigan’s Jacobs, Reuel thinks “the main issue with benchmarks is validity, even more than the practical implementation,” noting: “That’s where a lot of things break down.” For a task as complicated as coding, for instance, it’s nearly impossible to incorporate every possible scenario into your problem set. As a result, it’s hard to gauge whether a model is scoring better because it’s more skilled at coding or because it has more effectively manipulated the problem set. And with so much pressure on developers to achieve record scores, shortcuts are hard to resist. For developers, the hope is that success on lots of specific benchmarks will add up to a generally capable model. But the techniques of agentic AI mean a single AI system can encompass a complex array of different models, making it hard to evaluate whether improvement on a specific task will lead to generalization. “There’s just many more knobs you can turn,” says Sayash Kapoor, a computer scientist at Princeton and a prominent critic of sloppy practices in the AI industry. “When it comes to agents, they have sort of given up on the best practices for evaluation.” In a paper from last July, Kapoor called out specific issues in how AI models were approaching the WebArena benchmark, designed by Carnegie Mellon University researchers in 2024 as a test of an AI agent’s ability to traverse the web. The benchmark consists of more than 800 tasks to be performed on a set of cloned websites mimicking Reddit, Wikipedia, and others. Kapoor and his team identified an apparent hack in the winning model, called STeP. STeP included specific instructions about how Reddit structures URLs, allowing STeP models to jump directly to a given user’s profile page (a frequent element of WebArena tasks). This shortcut wasn’t exactly cheating, but Kapoor sees it as “a serious misrepresentation of how well the agent would work had it seen the tasks in WebArena for the first time.” Because the technique was successful, though, a similar policy has since been adopted by OpenAI’s web agent Operator. (“Our evaluation setting is designed to assess how well an agent can solve tasks given some instruction about website structures and task execution,” an OpenAI representative said when reached for comment. “This approach is consistent with how others have used and reported results with WebArena.” STeP did not respond to a request for comment.) Further highlighting the problem with AI benchmarks, late last month Kapoor and a team of researchers wrote a paper that revealed significant problems in Chatbot Arena, the popular crowdsourced evaluation system. According to the paper, the leaderboard was being manipulated; many top foundation models were conducting undisclosed private testing and releasing their scores selectively. Today, even ImageNet itself, t",

OpenAI is reportedly envisioning a future where it shares less revenue with longtime benefactor Microsoft. The artificial intelligence startup has an agreement with Microsoft to share 20% of its top-line revenue. However, OpenAI told investors it expects to share just 10% of its revenue with its partners, Microsoft among them, by 2030, The Information reported Tuesday (May 6), citing financial documents. The company continues “to work closely with Microsoft and [looks] forward to finalizing the details of this recapitalization in the near future,” an OpenAI spokesperson said, per the report. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, with an agreement to continue sharing revenue until 2030, the report said. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s strategy of installing AI as a default feature on its software seemed to be bearing fruit. The company recorded a 10% uptick in revenue from consumer subscriptions to Office 365 in the three months ending in March versus a year prior. News about OpenAI’s revenue plans came one day after the company announced it would revise its corporate plan to keep its nonprofit parent firmly in control of the for-profit entity behind ChatGPT. That decision reverses the company’s earlier plan that would have given up voting power in exchange for easier fundraising. “When we started OpenAI, we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission,” CEO Sam Altman wrote in a Monday (May 5) company blog post. “We started out staring at each other around a kitchen table, wondering what research we should do. Back then, we did not contemplate products, a business model. We could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users.” OpenAI is in the middle of planning a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank, which could value the company at roughly $300 billion. The round had been contingent on the company switching to for-profit control. Keeping the nonprofit arm could complicate the fundraising effort, but it could also help to defuse a lawsuit from OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, who accuses the company of straying from its public-interest roots.

        "description": "LinkedIn just released its 2025 Grad Guide highlighting the fastest-growing cities, industries, and job titles for new workers with and without a bachelor’s degree. A variety of industries and professions made the list. However, the new data offers a few surprises when it comes to what grads and non-grads are pursuing most often, with many non-grads heading into careers that once required college degrees—and many graduates in fields that don’t. When it comes to where young professionals are moving post-college, the Sun Belt states, including Tucson, Dallas, Tulsa, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, are turning into hot locations for new graduates to get to work. Entry-level non-grads are heading to big cities more often. San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York, Boston, Miami, and D.C. all made the list. But so did a few smaller hubs like Detroit and Orlando.Entry-level workers without a degree joining a variety of industries, with the fastest-growing fields being customer service, education, and real estate. Notably, financial services, a field which has typically required a college degree, is also on the list, meaning young professionals are breaking into the field in other ways that don’t involve four years of formal education. Marketing seems to be hugely popular for non-grads, too. It shows up three times on the list of the fastest-growing entry-level jobs, meaning marketing skills can be learned outside of a four-year college—perhaps by tech-savvy Gen Zers leaning into skills they learned by coming of age with social media at their fingertips. Non-grads are more frequently becoming marketing specialists, social media marketing specialists, and marketing coordinators.College grads are also joining a variety of industries, including in fields that don’t traditionally require a college degree. Case in point: Number one on the list of fastest-growing fields is construction. Real estate, utilities, wholesale, and administrative services were all growing fields for college graduates, too. Perhaps least surprisingly, new grads are leaning into technology, with artificial intelligence engineers landing as the fastest-growing job on the list.",

Other skilled trades are also on the rise among entry-level workers, with utilities coming in second place and oil, gas, and mining in third.\"Construction is topping the list,\" LinkedIn head of economics Kory Kantenga shared at a company event on Tuesday. \"Construction has had a really good few years.\"Kantenga said that momentum in construction is driven by the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA provides tax incentives for clean energy and energy-efficient investments, which could lead to more projects. The initiative also resulted in improved wages for clean energy workers.Growth in the industry is also a result of high interest rates for mortgages, which has led to fewer people selling their houses, and increased interest in building homes, Kantenga said.Growth in oil, gas, and mining among entry-level workers is likely tied to migration toward the Sunbelt, specifically Texas, Kantenga said.\"As the nation's top oil producer, Texas has drawn many entry-level workers since the pandemic, thanks to its lack of state income tax, lower cost of living, and milder weather compared to northern coastal regions,\" Kantenga said.New opportunities in skilled trade industries may also be a result of the AI boom. Efforts to develop AI have led to increased demand for energy infrastructure and policies.Google recently wrote in a blog post that there's a \"demand for trade skills that can construct electrical infrastructure.\" The tech giant announced in the post that it would support an effort to train 100,000 electrical workers and 30,000 apprentices in the US.\"A shortage of electrical workers may constrain America's ability to build the infrastructure needed to support AI, advanced manufacturing and a shift to clean energy,\" the announcement said.While college degrees aren't required to work in many skilled-trade industries, a job in construction or mining doesn't necessarily mean working in a position on the ground. For example, those graduating with law degrees might not be considering construction, but there are also opportunities for legal roles in the field, Kantenga said.\"There's actually a lot of due diligence that happens in construction with contracts,\" Kantenga said, adding that there \"might be council opportunities at big construction firms\" or due diligence jobs at legal firms.Just because construction is trending now doesn't mean that the career path will stay that way long term. Kantenga said at the event that some slowdown is expected in the industry if Canada is placed under import restrictions.\"We in America do not have enough lumber to build the houses that we want to build,\" Kantenga said, adding that new trade barriers on softwood lumber from Canada would be a headwind for the industry.While job seekers may not be able to control the obstacles industries face, Kentanga said it's important for job seekers to know the challenges of the industry they're entering and have a targeted approach.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "New AI features from LinkedIn will soon help job seekers find positions that best suit them—without the need for exact keyword matches or specific job titles. LinkedIn’s new AI-powered job search interface allows users to express their goals in plain language, says Rohan Rajiv, LinkedIn’s head of career products. For example, users can type a phrase like “business development or partnership roles in video games” and still be matched with relevant positions in the gaming industry, even if job listings don’t use those exact terms. Job seekers can also enter more abstract goals like “using brand marketing skills to cure cancer” to uncover marketing roles at pharmaceutical companies and oncology centers, Rajiv demonstrated in a session with Fast Company. Powered by large language model (LLM) AI, the new search tool interprets the intent behind job seeker queries and job descriptions, making it easier to match people with opportunities in a job market that often frustrates both applicants and employers. [Image: LinkedIn] “LLMs are amazing at looking at a job description and extracting semantics out of them and nuance out of them, and inferring things from them,” says Erran Berger, VP of engineering at LinkedIn. Recent survey data from LinkedIn shows that job seekers are applying to more positions than before, increasing the volume of applications that hiring teams must review. “They say they are spending three to five hours a day sifting through applications, and less than half of these applications meet the required criteria,” Rajiv notes. The enhanced AI search can also surface jobs and employers that applicants may not have previously considered. LinkedIn currently lists more than 15 million job postings. Another new feature, “job match,” helps users assess their fit for a role before applying. By analyzing both job descriptions and user profiles, the AI identifies how closely someone matches a job’s criteria and highlights areas where qualifications are strong or lacking—such as experience with a particular technology. [Image: LinkedIn] Unlike traditional keyword searches, LLMs are less likely to overlook relevant experience. For example, the AI understands that a web developer likely knows HTML, even if it’s not explicitly listed. This insight allows users to refine their profiles with relevant skills or consider roles better aligned with their background, saving time for both candidates and recruiters. Another feature will provide context around whether a position is “actively hiring,” whether it’s being promoted on LinkedIn, and, when available, how long applicants typically wait to hear back. These AI innovations build on tools introduced last year to help recruiters identify strong matches and come roughly 20 years after LinkedIn first began helping users connect with job opportunities. At that time, the company recognized that its vast career and network data could help recruiters discover candidates not actively searching for roles, Berger explains. “Twenty years ago, LinkedIn transformed the traditional job search by connecting recruiters with passive candidates,” CEO Ryan Roslansky says in a statement to Fast Company. “And today, with the launch of AI-powered job search, we’re not just introducing a new way to find a job, but an entirely new way to discover what’s possible.” LinkedIn has steadily expanded its job-matching capabilities, introducing automated job recommendations around 2010 and consolidating job search tools into a dedicated tab on its main platform in 2016. These changes reflect how users often combine job searches with other research activities, such as exploring company profiles. Currently, more than 11,000 LinkedIn users apply for a job every minute. The company expects that its rich history of job and job seeker data will continue to enhance its AI matching tools. “We’re really uniquely positioned to take this rich data that we have—and what’s possible with AI now—to build this feature in a way that few, if any, other companies can,” Berger says.",

        "description": "Ashlee Piper is a former political strategist turned eco-lifestyle journalist. She has been a Professor of Sustainability Marketing at Loyola University Chicago and eco instructor for LinkedIn Learning. Well-known companies, such as Airbnb, LUSH, and Nissan, have sought her counsel on sustainability practices. Piper has spoken at the United Nations, SXSW, and has a popular TED Talk. What’s the big idea? A life of overconsumption can feel almost inescapable in our hyper-personalized advertising ecosystem. Billions of dollars go into getting people hooked on shopping. Fortunately, a way out of this addictive cycle is the No New Things challenge, which guides anyone fed up with buyer’s remorse toward a healthier, happier, more sustainable lifestyle. Below, Ashlee shares five key insights from her new book, No New Things: A Radically Simple 30-Day Guide to Saving Money, the Planet, and Your Sanity. Listen to the audio version—read by Ashlee herself—in the Next Big Idea App. 1. It’s not you, it’s us. If you wrestle with overconsumption or just buy way more stuff than you’d like to, then you’re not alone. Fifty-four percent of Americans report feeling stressed by their stuff, 60 percent say they don’t have enough time in the day, and 80 percent are in some form of consumer debt. Overconsumption distracts us from what’s important and steals time, energy, money, and peace of mind—not to mention harms the planet. It’s safe to say that if you’re uncomfortable with your relationship to shopping, you’re probably experiencing one or more of these side effects. 2. It’s not your fault. Our drive to buy more, buy better, and seek out stuff to meet or fulfill every need and emotion we experience is the result of decades of deft marketing programming. Starting at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, Americans fundamentally shifted their consumption habits, and World War II turned consumerism into a patriotic act. From 1941 to 1945, advertising expenditures grew from $2.2 billion to $2.9 billion, and the 1950s were seen as the “advertiser’s dream decade” (think Mad Men). Today, companies collectively spend nearly $515 billion annually on marketing in the US, much of which is devoted to consumer insights, data, and research. “Our drive to buy more, buy better, and seek out stuff to meet or fulfill every need and emotion we experience is the result of decades of deft marketing programming.” I don’t want to sound like I’m wearing a tinfoil hat, but there are entire departments that track how you buy, when you buy, and what you buy, as well as your demographics like income, gender identification, marital status, and more. It’s no wonder we are constantly exposed to advertisements that show us exactly what we need or what they can convince us we need. 3. This is your brain on shopping. This conditioning isn’t just historical; it’s omnipotent and happening to you right now. It has morphed over the years to create an uncomfortable, unsustainable pattern that keeps industry overproducing, marketing playing on our emotions, and advertising driving us to buy because we don’t feel good enough. The act of browsing merchandise initiates the release of dopamine, so what you sometimes conflate with a feeling of pleasure is really you being flooded by desire. Let’s say you’re a little stressed or excited when going out on a shopping trip. In that scenario, adrenaline enters the equation, heightening your senses and making you more impulsive. You’re essentially high, teetering between feeling in control and out of control, which ratchets up the dopamine release even more. “The emotional high isn’t meaningfully sustained.” The interesting part about dopamine is that it’s released in anticipation of getting the thing you want. Before you even receive the item you’re coveting, dopamine begins to Irish Goodbye, leaving you feeling…sort of empty. That’s why many shoppers regret buying many of their impulse purchases. The emotional high isn’t meaningfully sustained. If you repeat this process regularly (aka: you shop at the same places around the same time), dopamine interacts with the part of the brain responsible for habit formation, recognizes your behavior as a pattern, and eventually automates it into a habit. In that way, impulsive shopping gets coded in your brain. This is biochemically similar to what happens when someone is addicted to drugs or alcohol. When you feel powerless over your shopping impulses, remember that you’re wired to chase your next fix. 4. The No New Things solution. Help is on the way in the form of my 30-day No New Things Challenge, designed to help you build strong neural pathways that move you away from knee-jerk shopping and toward more sustainable, economical, circular ways of getting your needs met. Each day is designed with an action item and reflection that is relatively easy to do, but incredibly powerful for building a new relationship with shopping. “You don’t need any supplies or fancy connections to get started.” Moreover, these action items help you extend the longevity of the things you already own, tap into gratitude for the abundance you already have, declutter your space and schedule, save loads of money, focus on your goals and dreams, and nurture the things that actually matter and make your life better. You don’t need any supplies or fancy connections to get started. No New Things is as easy as turning off of the shopping tap and learning to redirect shopping impulses to healthier-for-you activities. 5. Make it stick. The rest of the book covers how to keep the No New Things mindset going as an enjoyable lifestyle. You’ll hear from some of the people who have done the Challenge with remarkable results, from the family that saved enough money and got organized so they could adopt a little girl to the woman who saved a whopping $36,581 just from items she wanted to buy, tracked, and didn’t. And yes, I consider that savings because she saved herself from spending that amount. No New Things gives you the tools, guidance, and support to shift your mindsets and habits, and in turn, live better—while also being better to others and the planet. Thousands have participated in No New Things before it was a book, so imagine the community doing the Challenge alongside you. Imagine the broader, powerful impact it can make. Getting closer to a more peaceful, prosperous, satisfying life while also upending epidemic overconsumption? That’s a win-win.

        "description": "$899 laptop looks fine, but the cost savings might not be worth it. Microsoft is releasing a pair of new Surface devices today, both models that undercut last year's Surface Laptop and Surface Pro on price but also take a pretty big step down in specs. One of the devices is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which we've covered in more detail here. The other is a new 13-inch Surface Laptop, whose specs and price straddle the narrow gap between the current seventh-generation Surface Laptop and the original price of the aging Surface Laptop Go 3. The new Surface Laptop starts at $899, and preorders open today. It will be available on May 20. The new laptop shares many specs in common with last year’s entry-level seventh-generation Surface Laptop, including an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and support for Windows 11’s expanded Copilot+ capabilities. It’s also smaller and lighter than the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop. But the CPU has eight cores instead of 10 or 12, the screen is smaller and lower resolution, and you’re more limited in your upgrade options; we’ve outlined the key differences in the table below.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "New Surface Pro undoes a key improvement first used in 2014's Surface Pro 3. Microsoft is introducing a pair of new Surface devices today, both aimed slightly down-market from the 11th-generation Surface Pro tablet and 7th-generation Surface Laptop that the company released last spring. One is a 13-inch Surface Laptop, which we've covered in more detail here. The second (and more notably changed) device is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which is the first significant design change we've seen in the Surface Pro lineup since the first ARM-based Surface Pro X was released in 2019. Preorders for both new Surface devices begin today, and they begin shipping on May 20. The 12-inch Surface Pro starts at $799, and the keyboard cover remains a separate purchase, available for $149. The 12-inch Surface Pro is a cheaper alternative to the $939-and-up 13-inch Surface Pro (which Microsoft is continuing to sell), and the smallest Surface Microsoft has tried since the 10.5-inch underspecced Surface Go series. In addition to the smaller screen, the base model includes a bunch of other minor downgrades from the flagship 13-inch tablet, as outlined in the table below. But it's also nearly half a pound lighter, and its 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor should still deliver solid performance and compatibility with the extra Windows 11 features available on Copilot+ PCs.Read full article Comments",

Microsoft’s strategy to install artificial intelligence (AI) as a default feature on its software may be paying off. The company is seeing a 10% rise in revenue from consumer subscriptions to Office 365 in the three months ending in March compared to a year ago, according to a Thursday (May 1) report from The Information, citing Microsoft. The company added that this growth rate was faster than each of the past four quarters. Microsoft raised the lowest price of its software by 30% in January, which cost users $10 a month for individuals and $13 a month for households. Following the relative success of the price hike rollout, Microsoft may consider doing something similar for its corporate Office 365 users, The Information noted, adding that the company has weighed adding AI features to the platform for many years. Currently, enterprise users can choose to pay $30 per month per user for access to Microsoft’s AI chatbot, which enables them to search through documents, transcribe meetings on Teams and create emails or PowerPoint presentations. In other Microsoft news, the company said Thursday it was going to raise prices for its gaming console Xbox, as well as its controllers, citing “market conditions.” The company also said expects to raise the price of its new, first-party games starting during the holiday season. “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,” Microsoft said in a blog post. “Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.” Per PYMNTS’ report, the pricing for Xbox headsets will only change in the United States and Canada, and some Xbox controllers will remain the same price. Microsoft didn’t say if U.S. tariffs played a role in the price hikes, but the company relies on overseas manufacturing, including in China, according to a Bloomberg report. During its Wednesday (April 30) earnings call, the company said tariff uncertainty has caused computer makers’ inventory to rise to higher-than-usual levels.

        "description": "Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, and now its journey is over. Today is the day: Microsoft has formally shuttered the Skype app and service after announcing in February that Skype was being axed in favor of Microsoft Teams, the company's Slack competitor. The Skype apps have all been advertising the end of the service and pointing users to Teams for weeks now. As of today, if you open the app or navigate to the Skype site, you'll be directed to use Teams instead. The last active vestige of Skype is the Skype Dial Pad, which Skype subscribers and members with Skype Credits can still use to make calls to traditional telephone numbers (the Dial Pad is also incorporated into Microsoft Teams Free). It's an unceremonious end for an app that was once synonymous with video calls. Microsoft originally bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011; it was also owned by eBay from 2005 to 2009 and by a group of venture capital firms between 2009 and 2011. Ironically, Microsoft bought the app to replace its own first-party communication client at the time, Windows Live Messenger (which itself had grown out of the old MSN Messenger).Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Nora Carol Photography/Getty, DrPixel/Getty, Vectorig/Getty, WhatsApp, Facetime, Messenger, Skype, Ava Horton/BIBefore we were wedged into \"Brady Bunch\" squares on Zoom and Microsoft Teams, before we grew accustomed to summoning friends and family anytime, anywhere with FaceTime, there was Skype. Launched in Luxembourg in 2003, Skype became the first platform to offer free computer-to-computer voice calls for anyone. Soon after, it added video calling, giving birth to an era of on-demand videophoning that had been dreamed of since an astronaut called to wish his daughter on Earth a happy birthday in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"On Monday, Skype takes its final resting place in the graveyard of early-2000s services we loved and left behind.It's probably been years since you've made a call over Skype (though its dial tone still lives rent-free in my head). The company that brought us a miracle has been largely pushed aside and cannibalized by a slate of competitors. People don't care much about which video platform they're using, so whatever provides the simplest way to connect becomes the one we click to call.With video calling built into our phones, Slack, WhatsApp, and work email, the miracle has turned into the mundane — even a nuisance at times, when we need to go camera off. But for millennials, Skype was the magic that brought \"The Jetsons\" to life. Long-distance relationships were sustained on laptop Skype calls, even if they often glitched. Getting a webcam became a monumental rite of passage. For those early years, Skype realized the future.It was a darling of the early tech boom. In 2005, eBay bought it for $2.6 billion (a time when Facebook was worth $100 million). But Skype's video call focus didn't fit well with the e-commerce giant's business model. Two years later, eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on it and soon after began divesting its interests in Skype. A private equity firm took a majority stake. In 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion — its largest acquisition at the time. Some 170 million people were making Skype calls monthly, a number that grew to 300 million by 2016.But that's also when Skype started to lose its luster. \"A few rivals started to emerge that chipped away at different use cases that Skype used to be the go-to tool for,\" says Thomas Randall, an advisory director at Info-Tech Research Group. WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack were all integrating messaging and video calling, whether for work, gaming, or other personal use. Microsoft rolled out Teams in 2017. Skype's mobile interface lagged behind what became its internal rival, he says. \"The brand lost its focus,\" Randall says.In March 2020, Skype saw a surge in users, with 40 million people making calls daily, a 70% increase from the month before. That same month, Microsoft announced that Teams would roll out features to make the video calling app more friendly toward social interactions, but \"in the meantime, we invite you to connect with friends and family through chat and video calling using Skype.\" The demand for video chatting, driven by the pandemic lockdowns, wasn't enough to save Skype. Forty-four million people were using Microsoft Teams each day in March 2020, a number that grew to 70 million later that year. Zoom became even more synonymous with video calling and grew rapidly to 300 million daily users in April 2020. As of 2023, only 36 million people were still hanging out on Skype daily.Microsoft announced in February that it would sunset Skype and that people would have the option to move their data to Teams or export it by May 5. \"Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications and supporting countless meaningful moments, and we are honored to have been part of the journey,\" Jeff Teper, the president of collaborative apps and platforms at Microsoft, said in a post at the time.In the past few weeks, a Skype subreddit has been filled with the app's dwindling users, some panicking as they try to find a replacement for their years-old Skype numbers, which they have been using to receive authentication codes. One person says they're trying to switch their grandma's account from Skype to Teams, and some are worried about training older relatives on new apps.Others are watching its funeral with delight: \"I can't even feel sad for Skype's demise because it's been 14 years of shit from Microsoft and that's what I remember far more than the 8 years before the buyout,\" one person wrote on Reddit. \"I hope the original creators of Skype cashed out big time and are enjoying a nice retirement. They deserve it.\"Under Microsoft's leadership, Skype's features faltered. There were redesigns and new features, like the ability to be on a call with 100 people at a time and a revamped chat experience on mobile, but nothing quite brought Skype back to the forefront of the video calling industry. Competitors ramped up their offerings. With Microsoft's focus on Teams, Skype's importance waned. It wasn't as smooth a process to use it on mobile as it was with some of its competitors.\"By consolidating our efforts to focus on Teams, we can provide the best possible communication and collaboration experience,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email statement, adding that Teams offers several of the same features as Skype, including group calls, messaging, and file sharing, for free.Even as we see Skype's run come to an end, it's far from a failure. \"They rose at the right time. They sold at the perfect time,\" David Smooke, the founder of the blog HackerNoon, says of Skype. \"The fact that they're dying, it's part of life.\" He remembers the platform fondly, using it for long-distance job interviews in the 2010s and chatting for hours with long-distance romantic partners. Skype isn't just an app that triggers those sweet nostalgic feelings but also the foundation of how we communicate so frequently today.The deaths of some early-2000s social platforms have left holes in our collective internet memory. Skype was the place where I could talk to friends in high school without running over my monthly minutes on my flip phone. It was how I talked to my college boyfriend every day while studying abroad in Spain, creating that so-close-yet-so-far feeling that's become second nature with regular video calls. Now it's easy to feel that from any traces of ourselves we leave online. Other Web 2.0 defining sites like Myspace and Omegle have shuttered or become unrecognizable; Imgur and Tumblr have banned porn and frustrated users. With Skype's demise, it's likely most of us won't lose anything. There are so many free video calling platforms now, so we don't need it to connect and keep up with people we love.Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry. She writes about the biggest tech companies and trends.Read the original article on Business Insider Nora Carol Photography/Getty, DrPixel/Getty, Vectorig/Getty, WhatsApp, Facetime, Messenger, Skype, Ava Horton/BIBefore we were wedged into \"Brady Bunch\" squares on Zoom and Microsoft Teams, before we grew accustomed to summoning friends and family anytime, anywhere with FaceTime, there was Skype. Launched in Luxembourg in 2003, Skype became the first platform to offer free computer-to-computer voice calls for anyone. Soon after, it added video calling, giving birth to an era of on-demand videophoning that had been dreamed of since an astronaut called to wish his daughter on Earth a happy birthday in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"On Monday, Skype takes its final resting place in the graveyard of early-2000s services we loved and left behind.It's probably been years since you've made a call over Skype (though its dial tone still lives rent-free in my head). The company that brought us a miracle has been largely pushed aside and cannibalized by a slate of competitors. People don't care much about which video platform they're using, so whatever provides the simplest way to connect becomes the one we click to call.With video calling built into our phones, Slack, WhatsApp, and work email, the miracle has turned into the mundane — even a nuisance at times, when we need to go camera off. But for millennials, Skype was the magic that brought \"The Jetsons\" to life. Long-distance relationships were sustained on laptop Skype calls, even if they often glitched. Getting a webcam became a monumental rite of passage. For those early years, Skype realized the future.It was a darling of the early tech boom. In 2005, eBay bought it for $2.6 billion (a time when Facebook was worth $100 million). But Skype's video call focus didn't fit well with the e-commerce giant's business model. Two years later, eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on it and soon after began divesting its interests in Skype. A private equity firm took a majority stake. In 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion — its largest acquisition at the time. Some 170 million people were making Skype calls monthly, a number that grew to 300 million by 2016.But that's also when Skype started to lose its luster. \"A few rivals started to emerge that chipped away at different use cases that Skype used to be the go-to tool for,\" says Thomas Randall, an advisory director at Info-Tech Research Group. WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack were all integrating messaging and video calling, whether for work, gaming, or other personal use. Microsoft rolled out Teams in 2017. Skype's mobile interface lagged behind what became its internal rival, he says. \"The brand lost its focus,\" Randall says.In March 2020, Skype saw a surge in users, with 40 million people making calls daily, a 70% increase from the month before. That same month, Microsoft announced that Teams would roll out features to make the video calling app more friendly toward social interactions, but \"in the meantime, we invite you to connect with friends and family through chat and video calling using Skype.\" The demand for video chatting, driven by the p",

        "description": "Sometimes, you need to shake things up in your career. Maybe the job isn’t as fulfilling anymore. Maybe changing circumstances are pushing you toward a new path. Either way, figuring out what to do next can be a challenge. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is helping people explore their next steps—even when they’re unsure themselves. Chatbots like ChatGPT can offer some guidance, provided you know how to phrase your questions. But several companies have developed specialized tools that focus specifically on this issue. Google is leading the pack with its Career Dreamer. Described as “a playful way to explore career possibilities with AI,” it’s a tool that anyone can use. To get started with Career Dreamer, you’ll develop a “career identity statement,” which outlines your skills and experiences. After sharing your current job, the AI will ask follow-up questions about what that role involved. You can also add details about your educational background and any careers, industries, or fields that interest you. Career Dreamer then suggests potential career paths based on your input. (For example, among its alternate career suggestions for me were communications/public relations specialist, communications professor, and market research analyst—along with several jobs in the reporting field.) Hovering your mouse over each suggested field provides information about the type of degree typically required, the experience you’ll generally need, a description of the job, and—if you click through—the average salary. Find something that looks intriguing? You can click through to a list of local job opportunities or jump over to the Gemini AI tool to craft a résumé or cover letter. LinkedIn, meanwhile, offers the Next Role Explorer for users whose companies subscribe to its Learning Hub. That tool showcases potential opportunities within the company, suggests skills employees should develop, and shows how many openings exist in each role. It also displays the percentage of people who have successfully transitioned from the employee’s current role to the new one. AI, for that service, acts as a career coach, offering recommended courses and career paths. It also helps employees stay on track as they work toward acquiring the skills needed for a new role. At Salesforce, the company rolled out Career Connect last September—an internal talent marketplace that uses AI to help employees create personalized career paths tailored to their skills and aspirations. The tool is embedded in Salesforce’s Slack workflow. Employees can view roles they’re currently qualified for, as well as positions where their skills are easily transferable. If a job catches their interest, they can apply directly within Slack. Early results, Salesforce says, have been extremely positive: Ninety-one percent of the roles that were filled went to participants in the Career Connect pilot program who discovered those opportunities through the tool. During the three-month trial, 28% of participants applied for jobs via the platform. Given the ongoing fears that AI will take people’s jobs—freelance positions have already seen a 21% drop in demand—it’s somewhat reassuring to see it also being used to help people find them.",

        "description": "When Skype debuted in 2003, it was the first time I remember feeling that an individual app—and not just the broader internet—was radically disrupting communications. Thanks to its implementation of the voice over internet protocol (VOIP) and its simple interface, the app allowed users worldwide to call virtually any phone number directly from their PC with ease, in addition to calling other Skype users via its peer-to-peer (P2P) network. If you are too young to remember a time before smartphones, FaceTime, and WhatsApp, take it from me that Skype’s launch was truly revolutionary. It suddenly became simple to call home if you were traveling internationally. And if you frequently needed to contact overseas companies or individuals for work, Skype significantly reduced the associated costs. Bye-bye, outrageous international phone call charges. But come Monday, May 5, 2025—nearly 22 years after it changed communications—Skype will shut down for good. Since P2P voice calling is now integrated into nearly every popular messenger app, many will not miss it. But for the subset of us who continue to use Skype to call bona fide phone numbers via VOIP, we’ll need to find new solutions. Here’s why Skype is shutting down and how you can find suitable VOIP alternatives. The downfall of Skype Over the course of its 22 years, Skype has changed ownership many times. In 2005, just two years after the Luxembourg-headquartered Skype Technologies debuted its revolutionary app, eBay acquired it for $2.5 billion. In 2009, eBay sold its majority ownership in the app to private investors. Finally, in 2011, the service was sold in its entirety to Microsoft for $8.5 billion. At the time, $8.5 billion was the most Microsoft had ever paid for a company—and there was a good reason why it made the splurge. By 2008, Skype had swelled to a base of 400 million registered users, making it one of the most-used apps in the world. Microsoft saw Skype as the future of communication, and when the 2011 acquisition was announced, Skype CEO Tony Bates said that with Microsoft’s ownership, “we will be able to accelerate Skype’s goal to reach 1 billion users daily.” But over the next several years, as Microsoft integrated Skype into everything from Windows to smartphones to Xbox consoles, the app increasingly became bloated, going through numerous UI refreshes. What was once an easy P2P and VOIP service that allowed you to quickly call other users and nearly any phone number in the world was now cumbersome to use. But Skype’s problems weren’t all self-inflicted. The service was also faced with an explosion of competition. As smartphones proliferated, nearly every major communications app added P2P calling, including giants like Meta’s WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Apple’s FaceTime, and even more niche messengers like Signal. The mid-2010s also saw the rise of business communications apps like Slack and Microsoft’s own Teams—each of which allowed workers to communicate with their peers efficiently over text, voice, or video. And then came the pandemic in 2020. The world was under lockdown. This should have been the time for Skype to shine, but instead, Zoom took over, becoming the go-to communications app. It was simple to use, whereas Skype was cumbersome. Skype never recovered from that missed opportunity. With other apps having gobbled up Skype’s user base, and Microsoft’s increasing focus on Teams as its communications platform of choice, it’s no wonder that earlier this year, the company announced Skype will shut down for good on May 5. Skype VOIP alternatives for calling landline and mobile phone numbers The two main features that helped Skype take the world by storm in the early 2000s were P2P and VOIP calling. P2P let one Skype user call another using their username as the call identifier. VOIP let a Skype user call an actual phone number from the Skype app. Today, P2P calling apps are ubiquitous. The technology is integrated into nearly every smartphone messaging and communications app out there, including FaceTime, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Signal. Heck, even photo-sharing apps like Instagram have P2P calling functionality. But if you want to call an actual phone number from a smartphone app or your computer, your options are much more limited—especially after Skype shuts down on Monday. That’s because none of the popular apps above support VOIP calling. However, there are still a few good VOIP alternatives out there. Some of the best include: Google Voice: Google Voice gives you a phone number anyone can call to reach you, and from your Google Voice account, you can also make VOIP calls to most phone numbers in the world. However, VOIP calling is limited to users in the United States and Canada. Viber Out: Viber Out is an add-on service from the makers of the free Viber app, a P2P communications app. Viber Out adds VOIP functionality to Viber. This is the solution that most resembles what Skype was like in its prime: a simple, easy-to-use VOIP solution that allows you to purchase a variety of calling plans. Worldwide monthly subscription plans that let you call mobile and landlines start at just $5.99/month at the time of this writing. Zoom Phone: This is an add-on plan to Zoom that allows you to make VOIP calls to cell phones and landlines right from the Zoom app. This makes Zoom Phone similar to both Skype and Viber Out. There are various pricing options depending on whether you plan to make calls to U.S. and Canadian numbers or to phone numbers in other countries. It’s worth noting that Microsoft will also continue to offer ways for people to call landline phone numbers via a Microsoft Teams add-on feature called Teams Phone. However, Teams Phone is heavily designed around business use, so its features may be overkill and its cost a bit impractical for individuals simply looking for a quick, easy, and cheap way to make VOIP calls. Microsoft has also confirmed that any Skype users who still have active Skype Credits and subscriptions (which were required to make VOIP calls via Skype) after May 5 can still make VOIP calls by using a new Skype Dial Pad tool, which will remain available on the Skype web portal and within the free version of Microsoft Teams, known as Teams Free. However, these solutions are only available as long as your existing Skype credits or subscriptions remain.",

Skype, the blue bubble that once connected continents and conference rooms with a single click, will fall silent for good on Monday (May 5). For millions who remember the iconic ringtone and the thrill of seeing a loved one’s pixelated face appear on screen, the news lands with a bittersweet pang: after more than two decades, Microsoft is retiring Skype, the original king of internet calls. The end of Skype isn’t just the latest chapter in tech’s relentless cycle of innovation and obsolescence — it’s a calculated pivot. Microsoft, which acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, is consolidating its communication strategy around Microsoft Teams, a platform that has surged in popularity since the pandemic and now serves as the company’s all-in-one collaboration hub. Teams offers persistent chat, advanced meetings, file sharing and deep integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem features that go far beyond Skype’s original remit. But there’s more to the story than just a shiny new app. Skype’s architecture, built for the desktop era, struggled to keep pace with the demands of mobile-first, cloud-native communication. As user preferences shifted toward seamless, integrated and device-agnostic solutions, Skype’s relevance faded. The rise of competitors — Zoom, Slack, Google Meet, FaceTime — further eroded its market share, leaving Microsoft little choice but to focus its resources on a future-proof platform. Users React: Nostalgia, Frustration and Reluctant Acceptance For many, Skype’s retirement feels like losing an old friend. Social media and tech forums are awash with nostalgia and frustration. “Skype has served as a reliable platform for millions globally… Its familiarity and dependability have made it a preferred choice for maintaining connections with loved ones and facilitating business meetings,” wrote one user on Reddit, lamenting the loss of a tool that was as intuitive as it was accessible. Others worry about the disruption: “Many individuals, particularly those who are less tech-savvy or use older devices, might struggle to adapt to new platforms. This transition could disrupt personal and professional relationships that have flourished on Skype,” the same post continues. There’s also concern about losing distinctive features — affordable international calls, integrated chat and file sharing — that made Skype a go-to for both families and global teams. Still, Microsoft has provided a runway for migration: users can export their chat history and contacts, and Teams now allows sign-in with Skype credentials, promising a relatively smooth transition. But the emotional resonance of Skype’s departure is undeniable. For a generation, it was the bridge across borders, the tool that made “let’s Skype” a verb. 5 Other Significant Web Applications That Have Been Retired The digital graveyard is crowded with once-essential apps. Here are five other major platforms across Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon that are now retired: MSN Messenger/Windows Live Messenger (Microsoft): The chat platform that defined early 2000s instant messaging was officially discontinued in 2012, replaced by Skype itself. Google Jamboard (Google): Google’s collaborative whiteboard tool, used in classrooms and remote brainstorming sessions, was discontinued in 2024 as Google shifted focus to more integrated solutions. Internet Explorer (Microsoft): The browser that once dominated the web was retired in 2022, replaced by Microsoft Edge and marking the end of an era in internet history. Amazon Appstore for Android (Amazon): Amazon will discontinue its Appstore on Android devices in August 2025, streamlining its digital offerings and leaving Fire devices as its sole mobile app platform. iTunes (Apple): Once the center of Apple’s digital media universe, iTunes was officially replaced by separate Music, TV and Podcasts apps in 2019, reflecting a shift to streaming and cloud-based media. The Last Word: Zoom’s Unlikely Reign As Skype bows out, it’s hard not to notice the elephant in the virtual meeting room. Zoom, the platform that became a verb during the pandemic, continues to dominate the video conferencing landscape with 300 million daily active users and a brand that’s become synonymous with remote work. While Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are formidable contenders, Zoom’s ease of use and ubiquity have made it the default choice for everyone from FinTech boardrooms to family reunions. So as we bid farewell to Skype, let’s raise a glass (or a coffee mug) to the platform that started it all — and to Zoom, which, for now, remains the place where the world goes to “unmute,” “screen share” and wonder, once again, if anyone can hear them.

        "description": "According to a new research by the National Bureau of Economic Research, 33% of the Google users kept on using Bing after two weeks of testing it. This challenges the idea that Google dominates because it's the best option and shows that people keep on using Google because of habit instead of quality. Researchers from MIT, Stanford, and the University of Pennsylvania came together to understand why Google dominates 90% of the search market. They surveyed 2,354 desktop users and found that people do not use other search engines because they think they are bad, some have default settings that favor Google, switching to other search engines feels like a hassle, and some say that Google has a data advantage. Google claims that it is dominating because it has better quality, but that's not true; it's just that users haven't tried any other options yet. When the researchers paid users to use Bing for 2 weeks, 1 in 3 of the Google users kept using it afterwards, and 64% said that Bing was better than they expected. 59% also said that they have gotten used to Bing and said that its quality is better than Google's. When users were asked to choose a search engine, Bing being the top choice only increased by 1.1%, which shows that people are just used to choosing the default search engine, ie, Google. But when people got stuck using Bung, they said that they liked it more, and some didn't even switch back to Google. If Bing had access to search data like Google, its click-through rates would increase from 23.5% to 24.8%. The EU requires Google to show a list of search engines to users, and it can boost Bing’s share by 1.3% if users do not try the other alternatives as well.

Microsoft says it’s making passwordless logins the default means for signing in to new accounts, as the company helps drive an industry-wide push to transition away from passwords and the costly security problems they have created for companies and their users. A key part of the “passwordless by default” initiative Microsoft announced on Thursday is encouraging the use of passkeys—the new alternative to passwords that Microsoft, Google, Apple, and a large roster of other companies are developing under the coordination of the FIDO Alliance. Going forward, Microsoft will make passkeys the default means for new users to sign in.

Microsoft raised the recommended retailer pricing for its Xbox consoles and controllers worldwide, effective Thursday (May 1), and said it expects to raise the price of its new, first-party games starting during the holiday season. “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,” the company said in a blog post. “Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.” The pricing for Xbox headsets will change in the United States and Canada only, and some Xbox controllers will remain the same price, per the post. Microsoft didn’t say if U.S. tariffs played a role in the price hikes, but the company relies on overseas manufacturing, including in China, Bloomberg reported Thursday. During its Wednesday (April 30) earnings call, the company said tariff uncertainty has caused computer makers’ inventory to rise to higher-than-usual levels. Microsoft raised the price of the Series S 512GB console $80, to $380, and the Series X console $100, to $600, the report said. The increase planned for certain games will raise their price $10 to $80, per the report. It was reported April 29 that the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot told President Donald Trump during a meeting that while they have kept prices low despite tariffs, the situation can’t last. The executives said higher prices would be tough to avoid and some products could become scarce if retailers choose not to sell them due to tariff costs. Retailers have taken steps to deal with the tariffs. For example, Walmart put some winter holiday orders from Chinese manufacturers on hold, Target paused shipments of products it buys directly from Chinese manufacturers, and Amazon canceled some vendor orders from China once tariffs were announced. Small– to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are also being forced to make tough choices as they seek new ways to share, offset or avoid costs, or risk ceding the global marketplace to larger rivals, PYMNTS reported Monday (April 28).

        "description": "In the early days of the current AI boom, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. It was a seismic move, but perhaps the most notable thing about it is what came after. In the subsequent months, publisher after publisher signed licensing deals with OpenAI, making their content available to ChatGPT. There were others who chose litigation, certainly, but most major media companies opted to take some money rather than spend it on lawyers. That changed last week when Ziff Davis filed its own copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Ziff owns several major online properties, including Mashable, CNET, IGN, and Lifehacker, and garners a massive amount of web traffic. According to the filing, its properties earned an average of 292 million monthly page views over the past year. Strange, then, that OpenAI didn’t bother to negotiate with Ziff at all. The filing mentions that, after asking OpenAI to stop scraping its content without authorization, Ziff’s requests to negotiate were “rebuffed.” A news story about the lawsuit in PCMag (another Ziff property) also said OpenAI wouldn’t talk, though it’s unclear whether it was just repeating what the filing described. While The Times and Ziff aren’t alone in their legal efforts against OpenAI, it’s informative to compare the two complaints, filed almost 16 months apart, to get an understanding of how the stakes of the AI-media cold war have evolved. AI technology has progressed considerably and we now have a much greater understanding of AI substitution risk—the fancy name for AI summarization of publisher content. Ziff’s lawsuit gives us a better idea of how the AI sausage is made these days and can tell us just how much other AI players should be sweating. For starters, Ziff points to what has become table stakes in most of these lawsuits: the act of scraping content, storing copies of that content in a database, and then serving up either a “derivative work” (summaries) or the content itself as inherently violative of copyright. OpenAI has maintained, however clumsily at times, that its harvesting of content on the web to train models falls under fair use, a key exception to copyright law that has supported some instances of mass digital copying in the past. That’s the central conflict to all these cases, but Ziff’s action goes in some novel directions that point to how things have changed since ChatGPT first arrived: 1. AI, meet DMCA Ziff runs a few more yards with the copyright ball, claiming that OpenAI deliberately stripped copyright management information (CMI) from Ziff content. This is a bit of a technicality—essentially it means ChatGPT answers often don’t include bylines, the name of the publication, and other metadata that would identify the source. However, stripping out CMI from content and then distributing it under your own banner is a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), giving the filing more teeth. 2. It’s a RAG world now This is arguably the most important change between the two lawsuits and reflective of how the way we use AI to access information has changed. When The Times filed suit, ChatGPT wasn’t a proper search engine, and the public was only just beginning to understand retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG—broadly, how AI systems can go beyond their training data. RAG is an essential element of any AI-based search engine today, and it’s also massively increased the risk of AI substitution to publishers since a chatbot that can summarize current news is much more useful than one that only has access to archives that cut off after a certain date (remember that?). 3. Watering down the brands Ziff frames the hallucination problem in a novel way, calling it “trademark dilution.” Media brands like Mashable and PCMag (both of which I used to work at) have built up their reputations over years or decades, the complaint makes the case that every time ChatGPT attributes a falsehood to one of them or wholesale imagines a fake review, it chips away at them. It’s a subtle point, but a compelling one that points to a future where valuable brands slowly become generic labels floating in the AI ether. 4. Paywalls are the first line of defense Ziff says in the filing that its properties are particularly vulnerable to AI substitution because so little of its content is behind paywalls. Ziff’s business model is based primarily on advertising and commerce (mostly from readers clicking on affiliate links in articles), both of which depend on actual humans visiting websites and taking actions. If an AI summary negates that act, and there’s no licensing or subscription revenue to make up for it, that’s a huge hit to the business. 5. Changing robots.txt isn’t enough Every website has a file that tells web scrapers what they can do with the content on that site. This “robots.txt” file allows sites to, say, let Google crawl their site but block AI training bots. Indeed, many sites do exactly that, but according to Ziff, it makes no difference. Despite explicitly blocking OpenAI’s GPTBot, Ziff still logged a spike in the bot’s activity on some of its sites. It’s generally assumed companies like OpenAI use third-party crawlers to scrape sites they’re not supposed to, but Ziff’s lawsuit accuses OpenAI of openly flouting the rules it claims to respect. 6. Regurgitation is still an issue The original Times complaint spends many pages on the issue of “regurgitation”—when an AI system doesn’t just summarize a piece of content but instead repeats it, word for word. Generally this was thought to be a mostly solved issue, but Ziff’s filing claims it still happens, and that exact copies of articles are a relatively easy thing for ChatGPT users to call up. Apparently asking what the original text “might look like with three spaces after every period” is a method some have used to fool the chatbot into serving up exact copies of an article. (For the record, it didn’t work for me.) The battle continues Just when it was looking like licensing deals would be the new normal, Ziff Davis’s filing shows the fight between AI and news is far from over. How it plays out could end up being even more existential for a company like Ziff. However the court rules, the case confronts a more fundamental question: Can strong media brands that rely on commerce and free access coexist with AI systems that learn—and sometimes mislearn—from everything they touch?",

        "description": "Microsoft’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped deliver $70.1 billion in sales and boosted profits by 18% for the January-March quarter, a dose of relief for investors during a turbulent time for the tech sector and U.S. economy.The company reported quarterly net income of $25.8 billion, or $3.46 per share, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings of $3.22 a share.The Redmond, Washington-based software maker posted revenue of $70.1 billion in the period, its third fiscal quarter, up 13% from the same period a year ago and also beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Microsoft to post revenue of $68.44 billion for the quarter.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credited cloud growth for its strong quarter. The company’s cloud unit posted revenue of $26.8 billion, compared with expectations of $26.17 billion.“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” Nadella said in a statement.The company also saw a 6% increase in revenue in its personal computing unit, which includes its laptop business and Xbox services.Nadella noted on a call with investors that demand for cloud and artificial intelligence remained strong. He said Microsoft is constantly tweaking its investments based on efficiency improvements in computing systems and what kind of services customers want.“We just want to make sure we are accounting for the latest and greatest information,” he said.Microsoft is among a group of the tech industry’s bellwether companies that have been through a period of uncertainty and turmoil since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a see-sawing of stocks that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other actions.Microsoft’s stock price has dropped nearly 8% since Trump’s inauguration in January, to about $395 at the close of markets Wednesday. But investors appeared pleased moments later after Microsoft released its earnings report, sending stocks up more than 6% in after-hours trading.Revenue from Microsoft’s cloud computing business segment grew 21%, to $26.8 billion, also beating Wall Street projections.The company felt more tariff uncertainty in its personal computing business, which is centered around its Windows operating system and the fees it collects from computer makers that put it on the hardware they sell. Revenue from that business was $13.4 billion for the quarter, up 6% from the first three months of last year. —Associated Press",

The jump in tech shares helped indexes rally after a mixed day on Wednesday, following a slate of weak economic data.Here's where major US indexes stood around 10:00 a.m. ET: S&P 500: 5,625.28, up 1%Dow Jones Industrial Average: 40,941.39, up 0.67% (+272.03 points)Nasdaq Composite: 17,738.69, up 1.69%Meta raised capex guidance for 2025 to $64 billion to $72 billion from $60 billion to $65 billion, though higher costs due to tariffs could be playing a role in the increased guidance. The jump in capex plans suggests that the AI infrastructure buildout isn't slowing down as had been feared in recent months following the release of the highly efficient DeepSeek model from a startup in China.\"We expect this significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver,\" Meta Platforms CFO Susan Li said on the company's earnings call.Wall Street analysts cheered the results. Bank of America reiterated its \"Buy\" rating for the stock on Thursday and raised its price target to $690 per share, a potential jump of 16% from Thursday's intraday high. Meanwhile, Microsoft spent the bulk of its earnings call talking about the important of AI and how it's helping grow its business across the cloud and enterprise software.\"Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.Microsoft's Azure cloud business posted year-over-year revenue growth of 33%, of which about 16% was attributed to AI.\"The company is still doubling down on the AI monetization strategy within cloud,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note after Microsoft's earnings.Microsoft reiterated its guidance to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures this year.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Big Tech doesn't seem to think so.Microsoft and Meta this week took turns explaining why they see no sign of weakening interest in the AI they've bet their futures on, reporting earnings that appeared to shrug off concerns over recent analyst notes suggesting wobbles in demand. Meta said it was updating its guidance on capital expenditure for the year to $64-72 billion, up from $60-65 billion.Meanwhile, Microsoft said its capital expenditure was up from $14 billion in the same quarter last year to $21.4 billion in the most recent quarter. These are both signs that the two companies are willing to spend more and more on the critical infrastructure needed to host the AI services in high demand from customers.Microsoft posted cloud unit revenue of $42.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025, beating analyst expectations. Revenue in the unit accounting for the AI data center services it provides to customers jumped 20% year over year.A Jefferies analyst note, published Thursday, said that \"AI demand is trending higher than expected\" for Microsoft, pointing to the soaring number of AI tokens the company processed in its third financial quarter. The updates appeared to have done enough to convince investors that the AI boom is staying strong — Microsoft shares opened up more than 9% on Thursday, while Meta was up about 5% — despite recent reports suggesting a slowdown in demand for Big Tech data centers.Last week, analysts at Wells Fargo published a report claiming that AI data center giant Amazon had paused some of its data center leasing discussions. In response, an Amazon Web Services executive said there was still \"strong demand\" to provide the technology underpinning the AI boom. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed anxieties about data center pauses in a call with investors on Wednesday, as his company had also been the subject of a report earlier this year claiming that it was canceling lease commitments.During the call, he said he felt \"very, very good\" about the pace at which his company's data center expansion was taking place.Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said the company had a \"customer contracted backlog of $315 billion\" for server technology like graphics processing units, or GPUs.Google got the ball rolling Google helped set the stage for both Microsoft and Meta when it reported earnings last week, showing a 28% year-on-year jump in first-quarter revenue in its AI-focused cloud computing unit to $12.3 billion. Capital expenditure also rose from $12 billion year-on-year to $17.2 billion.All these suggestions that the AI hype train shows no sign of slowing come with a few asterisks, however.Meta's increase in full-year guidance on AI infrastructure spending? Some of that is down to rising costs against a backdrop of tariffs, according to Meta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, who offered a tone of caution to investors on Wednesday.\"The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world, and there's just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions,\" she said.Both Google and Microsoft, meanwhile, have shown that while revenue in their cloud units has hit higher and higher targets, there has been a slight decrease in the revenue growth rates at their cloud units over the past two quarters.Some of this may result from cyclical trends; data centre revenue can sometimes fluctuate throughout the year as companies manage waves of demand. The other caveat is that the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia could shift the AI narrative when they report earnings this month. For now, Big Tech is clear. Demand is still coming for AI, and so too is Big Tech's spending.Read the original article on Business Insider Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella are all in on AI.AP Photo/Jeff ChiuMicrosoft and Meta just showed investors they have no plans to slow down their AI investments.Going into earnings, multiple analyst reports had suggested some Big Tech data center leases were being rethought.There are a few caveats to Microsoft and Meta's AI growth story, however.Is there a let-up in the AI mania?

Some of that is down to rising costs against a backdrop of tariffs, according to Meta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, who offered a tone of caution to investors on Wednesday.\"The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world, and there's just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions,\" she said.Both Google and Microsoft, meanwhile, have shown that while revenue in their cloud units has hit higher and higher targets, there has been a slight decrease in the revenue growth rates at their cloud units over the past two quarters.Some of this may result from cyclical trends; data centre revenue can sometimes fluctuate throughout the year as companies manage waves of demand. The other caveat is that the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia could shift the AI narrative when they report earnings this month. For now, Big Tech is clear. Demand is still coming for AI, and so too is Big Tech's spending.Read the original article on Business Insider",

On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn.The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there.The MsMicrosoft. It was a big win. The company reported $70.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share, or EPS, of $3.46, surpassing analysts' expectations. CEO Satya Nadella pointed to two things that drove the growth: AI infrastructure and cloud services. In an internal memo viewed by BI, the company's CFO also highlighted a \"glimpse of what's ahead.\" The stock is up almost 9% in premarket trading.Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs.Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell.The AsApple. Tariffs will be a hot topic for investors as China, the main hub for Apple manufacturing, faces a 145% levy. An EMARKETER analyst highlighted three tariff-related issues that investors will want clarity on: \"Apple's ability to absorb, avoid, or pass on potential price increases, the financial impact of tariffs, and the timeline for effective supply chain diversification.\" The other big question mark: When will the promised Apple Intelligence-powered upgrade super cycle arrive? Here's what investors will be watching.Amazon. Wall Street is cautious heading into Amazon's first-quarter earnings. Analysts at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank expect forecasts to be met or surpassed. However, investors' main focus will be the company's second-quarter guidance — the quarter in which the impact of tariffs is expected to be felt. Here's what some of the biggest banks are saying.3 things in markets1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months.2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon.3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI.3 things in tech1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces.2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday.3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs.3 things in business1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI.2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were \"no plans\" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work.3.

        "description": "You'll have to pay $80 to $100 more for an Xbox console going forward. Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season. The announcement comes after \"careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\" Microsoft said. In the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99). The new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will \"provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers.\" That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Software giant Microsoft just released its latest quarterly performance report, Q3 2025, for LinkedIn. And there are no surprises here as the popular social networking app showed record engagement. The app witnessed a 9% session growth during the measurement period, with high engagement figures. This is the same update that we’ve seen in its parent firm's report in each quarter.It’s not just exaggerations, but now even analysts are questioning the stats because how come it’s the same each time? The session growth for LinkedIn stood at 11% during the same reporting period of 2024, but right now, it’s just 8%.Now, if the stats keep going up, then great. But provided the limited stats, all we can confirm is how LinkedIn continues to produce funds with a 7% YoY revenue, and the popularity keeps rising. Users are returning for more.Microsoft did share some more LinkedIn performance notes during the earnings call this year. Membership for LinkedIn has now hit double-digit growth YoY. We have to admit that even this is misleading because members aren’t the same as active users. Considering that more and more people enter the workforce, you’d expect the figures for people signing up on the app to rise. We don’t believe this means a lot as far as understanding how valuable or popular it is. We can confirm that, depending on the EU data for the app, nearly 28% of the app features members from Europe every month. If this is to be believed, then that means the app’s MAU is nearly 280M as compared to the headline figure of billions. We would assume that in America, the usage is greater. But you’d also be shocked to learn how the userbase is nearly that of Reddit as compared to big giants like Instagram or X.When comparisons are done in this way, it assists in informing about ad spending. Still, the app is unique, so it might not make a big difference in that manner. Microsoft shared how the time spent seeing videos on the platform rose by 36% YoY, while comments grew by 32%.So this time around, the engagement data is quite a bit. Comments keep rising, and that could give rise to a more informed approach. Video posts are driving so much engagement, and LinkedIn also shared how the video content generates 1.4 times more engagement than other formats. Carousel posts attract more engagement, as per an analysis conducted by third parties.LinkedIn also saw a lot of its audience tap into the world of AI to get better skills and find better jobs. The figure for learners who use AI-based coaching rose nearly double QoQ. More users get more aware of AI, and that means they’ll use more of it. Remember, everyone is looking for ways to make posting better and beneficial.Microsoft confirmed how signups for the company’s Premium page rose 75% QoQ. Some feel even this is misleading as signups will increase, depending on availability. Hence, we’re not too sure about it being indicative.This is the means LinkedIn has been since it was taken under the wings of Microsoft in 2016. It’s no longer required to provide detailed performance reports as it’s not a separate entity as it once used to by. So if Microsoft says vague stats like record engagement, then that’s the best you’ll get.

Price/SXSW Conference & Festivals via Getty ImagesLinkedIn is launching a slate of original video shows with influencers.Business-focused creators like Steven Bartlett and Rebecca Minkoff are making the content.It's part of LinkedIn's efforts to snag a piece of the creator economy and become a video hub.Have you noticed more professionally produced videos in your LinkedIn feed recently? It's by design, and you can expect to see more.LinkedIn on Thursday said it's launching a new slate of five original shows from business-focused creators, including the entrepreneur and \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast host Steven Bartlett, the fashion designer \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Rebecca Minkoff, and Candace Nelson, who founded Sprinkles Cupcakes and the Pizzana pizzeria chain.LinkedIn's new video push comes as tech companies, from Spotify to YouTube, scramble to lock down top creator talent.Davang Shah, LinkedIn's VP of marketing, told Business Insider that the effort is also part of the platform's increased focus on video. Total video viewership is up 36% this year versus last, and video creation is growing at twice the rate of other post formats, he said.The new LinkedIn shows will focus on topics such as female entrepreneurship, the CEO playbook, and artificial intelligence. The other creators taking part are Shelley Zalis, founder of The Female Quotient; Guy Raz, host of the \"How I Built This\" podcast; and the author Bernard Marr.LinkedIn said more shows from additional content creators are in the works, though the company plans to keep the selection highly curated for now.The new shows mark an expansion of LinkedIn's Wire Program, which has been renamed BrandLink. The initial 2023 to 2024 launch partners were professional news publishers like The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and Business Insider. LinkedIn said it's also bringing on new publishers this year, including The Washington Post, Front Office Sports, and Adweek.The expansion to creators, however, shows how influencers are becoming an increasingly important part of social media, especially when it comes to news topics. While LinkedIn was once seen as a largely self-promotional tool for job seekers, more corners of the business community — from venture capitalists, to CEOs, and marketers — are regularly coming to the platform to riff on the latest news and other trending topics in their industries.The BrandLink program lets the publishers and creators monetize their videos through pre-roll ads on their shows, which appear in the feed as users scroll the app. Like YouTube, users can skip the full ad after watching for a few seconds. Advertisers can choose which shows they want to appear in and use LinkedIn's data to target specific cohorts of users, with pricing determined by an ad auction.LinkedIn has typically kept a 50% cut of the ad revenue through the BrandLink program, a publisher exec told BI. A LinkedIn spokesperson said the company couldn't share specifics about the revenue share model. Creators own the intellectual property of the content they create for LinkedIn, and they are free to distribute the content on other platforms — but they must post it to LinkedIn first, the spokesperson said.LinkedIn's professional, affluent audience is attractive to advertisersLinkedIn has long courted creators. In 2012, it launched its Influencers program, encouraging famed businesspeople like Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Arianna Huffington to post to the platform. But its efforts have ramped up in recent years, as it's rolled out tools for famous and everyday creators alike, designed to help them showcase their expertise and boost their followings. Creators told BI last year that they had seen early success by posting videos to its TikTok-style vertical video feed.Shah said advertisers are drawn to content on the platform that has credibility and authenticity.\"When you produce authentic and trusted content, it leads to connections, it leads to conversations, and ultimately, it leads to closed deals, and that's what marketers care about the most,\" Shah said.For LinkedIn, any uptick in user numbers and engagement boosts its advertising business. Research firm EMARKETER, a sister company of BI, forecasts that LinkedIn will generate $8.06 billion in ad revenue in 2025, up 12.4% year-on-year.LinkedIn's video ambitions face stiff competition from YouTube and TikTok, which already host oodles of business and finance-focused content. YouTube, in particular, has become a top destination for podcasts, including the aforementioned \"Diary of a CEO.\"Brendan Gahan, the CEO of Creator Authority, an influencer marketing agency focused on LinkedIn, said the platform has its advantages, however. It ticks off attributes that many marketers want: A large audience (more than 1 billion users, per LinkedIn), strong ad tools, and a largely brand-safe environment. Gahan said what sets the platform apart is its professional, affluent niche.\"This is where decision-makers and executives actually spend time,\" Gahan said. \"Probably more time than any other platform.\"As LinkedIn goes all in on video, Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, an analytics platform and data consultancy, said the platform should avoid chasing volume over value.\"LinkedIn must curate high-signal content that matches the platform's professional intent, not just push engagement bait,\" Cicero said. \"The goal isn't scale, it's signal. You don't need a million views. You need the right 10 decision-makers.\"Read the original article on Business Insider \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast host Steven Bartlett has a show coming to a LinkedIn feed near you.Amy E.

Microsoft will continue investing in capital expenditures throughout its fiscal year 2026 after seeing its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings lead its revenue gains in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. “These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead,” Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said Thursday (April 30) during the company’s quarterly earnings call. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business led the company’s revenue growth during the quarter ended March 31, according to a presentation released Wednesday in conjunction with the call. The Intelligent Cloud business was up 21% year over year, while Productivity and Business Processes was up 10% and More Personal Computing was up 6%. Overall, Microsoft’s revenue was up 13% year over year, per the presentation. “Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs and accelerate growth,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said during the call. During the most recent quarter, the company opened data centers in 10 countries on four continents, Nadella said. He added that model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months and that the company’s cost per token has more than halved. Microsoft is introducing AI agents “for every role and business process,” Nadella said during the call. He highlighted a Sales Agent that turns contacts into qualified leads, Sales Chat that can get reps up to speed on new accounts and a Customer Service Agent that manages customer inquiries and helps service reps resolve issues faster. “This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter over quarter,” Nadella added during the call. Looking ahead, Microsoft expects its Intelligent Cloud business to see revenue growth of 20% to 22% in constant currency during the current quarter. (In the quarter ended March 31, it grew 22% in constant currency.) This growth will be driven by its cloud platform Azure. “In our non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving healthy growth,” Hood said during the call. “In our AI services, while we continue to bring data center capacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.” The post Microsoft to Continue Building Data Centers as Cloud and AI Lead Growth appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

From the department of head scratches comes this counterintuitive news: Microsoft says it has no plans to change a remote login protocol in Windows that allows people to log in to machines using passwords that have been revoked. Password changes are among the first steps people should take in the event a password has been leaked or an account has been compromised. People expect that once they've taken this step, none of the devices that relied on the password can be accessed. Not just a bug The Remote Desktop Protocol—the proprietary mechanism built into Windows for allowing a remote user to log in to and control a machine as if they were directly in front of it—however, will in many cases continue trusting a password even after a user has changed it. Microsoft says the behavior is a design decision to ensure users never get locked out.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently made a shocking admission in front of the world about how 30% of the firm’s code was produced using AI software. The news broke during an explosive chat where he sat down with tech billionaire and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at this year’s LlamaCon Meta Conference. The figure was revealed when Zuckerberg questioned how much the company’s code is made using AI today. The CEO replied by saying his organization saw mixed results in regards to AI code across various languages. However, the greatest progress made was towards Python and less in C++. As per the CTO of Microsoft, he expects 95% of this code to be produced by AI by the year 2030.When he asked the same question to Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO replied by stating he had no idea how much AI was used to produce Meta’s code. The news comes after we saw Microsoft’s archrival Google share its earnings call last week. CEO Sundar Pichai didn’t hold back with the facts and figures, highlighting how AI was making more than 30% of the organization’s code. For now, we’re not sure which parameters these tech giants are using for measurements of what is produced by AI and what’s not. Therefore, it’s best to take the replies with a dash of salt, as per the experts. Read next: Meta Outlines Exciting New Features on WhatsApp including AI Functionality and Video Calls for Web",

        "description": "The year is 2014, and I’m stuck in Ukraine. I have a particularly antsy mother who wasn’t keen on me visiting the country just weeks into Russia’s attempted invasion, and she is expecting me back home. In Odessa—hundreds of miles away from the Maidan and the nascent conflict—the worst example of war I’d seen was a heated snowball battle between those who wanted to remain Ukrainian and those who wanted to be Russian. The reason I’m stuck has nothing to do with Russia: It’s bad fog grounding flights at the tin hut airport I’m due to fly out of. But with no reliable phone communication back home, I know my family will put two and two together and make five. The problem is allayed when I return to the plush hotel I’d been staying at, which was happy to have us pay for another night’s lodging, and get on Skype. I’m able to call home, explain what happened, and keep them from panicking when I don’t step off the plane back in the U.K. as expected. International calls remain prohibitively expensive. And for a generation that doesn’t own smartphones—like my parents—or a country that steadfastly refuses to join the rest of the world on WhatsApp (hello, United States), Skype has proven a lifeline. My use of the platform—to call home when stuck in war-torn Ukraine for an extra day, or to check on the status of my sick grandfather in hospital on the sidelines of a conference in the U.S. earlier this year—is very much a first-world problem. But the reality is that the imminent closure of Microsoft’s digital calling service (which the company attributes to dwindling user numbers and its belief that the same service can be offered through Microsoft Teams) will leave a significant gap for many who depend on it. I’m not a Skype power user, but by my own estimation, I’ve used the platform at least once a week for the last decade or more. My job as a tech journalist means I frequently call American contacts and sources. The country’s intransigence and refusal, with very few exceptions, to download and install WhatsApp on their cellphones means that unless I want to be hit with eye-watering minute-by-minute charges for calling them for interviews, I need to find an alternative. Since the early 2010s, that alternative has been a rolling Skype subscription to call the U.S.—400 minutes per month, landline and cellphones, has proved plenty for me. Shortly, it won’t be. Our lives, and our families, are increasingly scattered to the four winds. And in the two decades since its 2003 founding, Skype has helped those families stay connected. It’s also helped a good number of people whose jobs involve international interactions do so at a manageable cost. It’s notable that mentioning the closure of Skype on a regular roundup of tech news stories I do for a U.K. radio station received the most personal correspondence from listeners. They told me they too were worried about the closure of the service and were seeking out alternatives. Skype has long been unloved, long surpassed by the likes of Zoom and—whisper it quietly, and by tamping down your gag reflex—Microsoft Teams. Indeed, it’s Teams that Skype is recommending people move to, without realizing it doesn’t offer exactly the same experience. But Skype was our little app that could. And its disappearance will be a loss for many beyond just me.",

        "description": "In the days before a recent ballot referendum in Seattle that would determine the future of social housing in the city, large tech companies spent big. Amazon and Microsoft, both of which are headquartered in the Seattle metropolitan area, each donated $100,000, and opponents of a tax to fund social housing spent a combined $780,000 in the lead-up to the February 11 vote. Despite this, the vote on a corporate tax to fund the city’s social housing authority won, with 63% of voters supporting it. In 2023, voters had already resoundingly approved the social housing authority, agreeing that a new entity would be created to acquire and construct mixed-income housing and keep it permanently affordable and under the city’s ownership. But this February, voters were asked to return to the polls to determine how to fund the authority—or whether it would be funded at all. The first question on the ballot asked if voters approved of funding the new authority using payroll taxes. Next, voters had to choose whether they wanted a new 5% payroll tax on individual compensation above $1,000,000, paid by companies, or to use an existing payroll tax that mostly funds affordable housing. The new tax could bring in $52 million of funding each year for social housing. The second option would appropriate $10 million a year for five years that had already been set aside. The city’s big tech companies had no interest in paying a new tax. In addition to contributions from Amazon and Microsoft, Seattle’s Chamber of Commerce donated $40,000 and T-Mobile donated $20,000 to derail an additional tax on companies. But according to Tiffani McCoy of House Our Neighbors, a Seattle nonprofit that has been one of the lead supporters of the social housing authority, the influx of spending actually hurt Big Tech’s case. “Frankly, Amazon donating was a godsend for us,” McCoy says. “We capitalized on the fact that Amazon and Microsoft were dumping in $100,000, and we made clear to voters that these corporations don’t want you to have social housing.” McCoy says the campaign to fund the social housing authority with a corporate tax sent mailers, paid for digital advertising, and made social media posts that played up the tech companies’ donations. Supporters also held a rally in front of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. “There’s a lot of resentment toward tech billionaires who are part of the Trump regime here in Seattle,” she says. The win suggests a way forward for organizers on the local level to take the housing crisis into their own hands. Persistent federal inaction and recent drastic attacks to HUD have provided motivation. “We needed to Trump-proof our housing sector,” McCoy says. “And I think that helps because there’s mass opposition to what he’s doing.” The vote also showcased a groundswell of resentment toward Big Tech that has been percolating among voters. The authority will initially be modest in its ambitions, as it won’t have funding to develop housing anywhere near the scope or scale of the private market. The plan is to build or preserve 300 units a year, once funding comes in, according to the social housing development authority—but it will own those units and will be able to issue its own debt. The first step, proponents say, is to make sure the money actually comes through. What will Seattle’s social housing authority do? The initial ballot referendum to build a social housing authority in Seattle passed in February 2023 with 57% of the vote. It created a public development authority, a type of government-owned private entity that can take out debt by issuing bonds. The term “social housing” has been used broadly in recent years to refer to types of housing that are not subject to the speculative market, including public housing, forms of subsidized affordable housing, and housing owned by community land trusts. Seattle’s referendum referred to social housing as “publicly owned and financed mixed-income housing intended to be permanently affordable.” According to the housing authority’s charter, that means it will acquire or build housing and rent it to people making between 0% and 120% of the area median income, with rents never exceeding 30% of a tenant’s income. The median income for a family of four in Seattle is about $160,000, according to the Seattle Housing Authority. That means families in properties owned by the authority could be paying between $0 and about $4,700 a month, depending on their income. Since the authority’s properties are not meant to be resold, it could provide a modicum of stability to lifelong renters as they age. Market-rate properties are meant to increase in value every year, but seniors with fixed incomes don’t see their pay increase as they age. For decades, working Americans in general haven’t seen their pay increase significantly. The authority’s charter also creates a mediation provision for tenants to prevent evictions: According to the charter, “residents MUST be afforded opportunities for restorative justice conflict resolution prior to being subject to eviction procedures.” “There’s not the pressure of somebody’s investment that is in cross purposes to their ability to stay there,” says Julie Howe, a Seattle Social Housing board member. The authority will issue its own debt in the form of bonds and create a revolving loan fund, lending itself money for construction and acquisition that would be paid back through rents, with higher rents subsidizing lower rents. Debt is a large and under-discussed factor in the cost of housing, as developers often price units to pay back loans. By using its own funds for construction, the authority will be able to reduce interest payments that can cause rents to balloon. The authority will be governed by a board with 13 members, including 7 appointed by the Seattle Renters’ Commission, an advisory board that consults with the mayor and city council. They will be mainly focused on the authority’s fiscal responsibilities and making sure it remains aligned with its mission. While public housing is notoriously underfunded in the United States, the result of a bipartisan aversion to government-owned housing, McCoy says the mixed-income approach that Seattle is taking with its own development authority might prove more sustainable, as it doesn’t require as much direct subsidy. The authority’s approach is also less convoluted than building housing using Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which requires multiple layers of financing on top of the federally issued credits. But there still needs to be a dedicated revenue stream to staff the development authority, to purchase and construct housing, and to issue bonds. The state law establishing public development authorities does not allow them to impose taxes. And the 2023 ballot referendum was limited to creating the authority; a dedicated funding stream was always going to require a second ballot measure. Some opponents of the social housing authority, which includes not just big tech but affordable housing developers, believed that the new ballot measure was an opportunity to relitigate whether the authority should be established at all. “They’re really looking for a do-over,” McCoy said prior to the February vote. Taxing the wealthy Rather than opposing the authority outright, opponents opted to put option 1B on the ballot to essentially recreate the affordable housing system that exists in Seattle, with no new funding. That option would have effectively made the social housing development authority moot: the city’s affordable housing fund that it would have pulled from can only go toward people making 80% of the area median income or lower, which means that the authority would not be able to cross-subsidize rents. According to Howe, the board member, this would have put the agency in conflict with affordable housing developers who rely on the existing funding stream. “That would essentially go against how we were founded,” Howe says. Suresh Chanmugam, a tech worker organizing with the group Tech for Housing, says tech companies don’t mind Washington having one of the most regressive tax codes in the nation. Because the state has no income tax, most taxes are derived from consumer sales and property, regressive taxes where poorer people have an effective tax rate much higher than the wealthiest. Chanmugam believes rich companies use the lack of an income tax as a pretext to pay their employees less than they would in other states. He says that dozens of members of the Tech for Housing coalition knocked on doors, tabled at farmers markets and phone banked across the city. “When people hear, ‘Hey, do you want to tax companies to fund social housing?’, people say yes, because there’s near universal appeal in Seattle for making big businesses pay their fair share in taxes,” Chanmugam says. He says he personally spoke to about 300 voters while canvassing and only received pushback from one or two people. It makes sense that tech workers have opposing priorities to their employers: While tech workers are typically high earners, many would benefit from the social housing authority, which would ensure that people making 120% of AMI, or around $190,000 for a family of four, would pay only 30% of their wages toward rent in units it owns. That would greatly offset any pass-through cost put on their wages by tech companies. According to campaign finance records, Microsoft and Amazon were tied for the highest donations to the campaign for option 1B—using existing tax—at $100,000 each. It’s not the first time that spending from tech companies has backfired in Seattle. In 2019, Amazon and the Chamber of Commerce supported a slate of City Council candidates, most of whom lost. The corporate tax was also opposed by the mayor; ads for option 1B, which would use existing funds, had pictures of his face on it. One opp",

Nvidia shares fell early on as the Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei is getting ready to test a new and powerful artificial intelligence processor that the Chinese tech giant hopes can replace some Nvidia products. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are edging lower, while Tesla, Meta and Apple are muted. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it’s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with President Donald Trump and the US due to the imbalance of trade between the two nations. Lori Calvasina, Head of US Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets, explains why larger firms are better positioned to navigate the uncertainly than their smaller peers.

        "description": "We’re facing a career confidence crisis. Work is changing fast, yet many employees feel stuck. At LinkedIn, our data shows workforce confidence has dropped to a five-year low, and only 15% of employees say their manager has supported them with career planning in the past six months. Managers can play a big role in righting the ship—helping employees build the new skills they need to stay relevant and develop into future leaders. But this requires a fundamental shift: transforming them from task-overseers to coaches developing talent and sparking the best ideas from their teams. There are some key steps any company can take now to develop a culture of coaching that starts with your managers—but extends well beyond them. Start to develop your managers as coaches If you want your managers to become coaches, that starts by coaching your coaches. Just like elite athletes rely on coaches to reach peak performance, managers also need coaching to unlock their full potential. Coaching is a skill that needs to be intentionally developed. Executives are starting to grasp this opportunity. Nearly 80% of global CHROs agree their managers in the future will spend less time managing tasks and more time coaching teams. Leading companies are doubling down on this already. For instance, IBM supports first‑ and second‑line managers to grow through targeted programs, assessments, and skill-aligned badges. Manager Impact, for example, is an interactive learning experience that coaches new managers on how to lead with confidence, create meaningful employee experiences, and navigate real-world leadership challenges. Managers who complete these programs achieve significantly higher employee engagement scores, says IBM. Coca-Cola is taking similar steps to grow managers into coaches by implementing rigorous leadership assessments to select the right people for leadership roles, and then providing cohort-base development to set those people managers up for success as coaches. They’ve seen notable upticks in how employees are rating their managers, as well as a boost in overall employee satisfaction. Taking the time to develop your managers into coaches is key to helping employees get “unstuck” and supercharging growth across the business. Plus, providing managers with the tools and support they need to excel in their roles improves their own retention and engagement, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits the entire organization. Consider making professional 1:1 coaching an employee benefit It’s important to recognize your teams are operating through a moment of historic work change. By 2030, we expect 70% of the skills used in most jobs will change, with AI emerging as a catalyst. To keep pace, your people need more support. Training managers to coach is essential, but they can’t do it alone. That’s why more companies are bringing in independent career coaches who offer specialized guidance on complex workplace challenges, like navigating difficult workplace relationships, managing career transitions, or developing crucial interpersonal skills that AI can’t replicate. Kearney, a business consulting firm and LinkedIn Top Company for 2025, has taken this approach by offering a six-month individualized coaching program and practice rotations designed to accelerate consultant growth. And at LinkedIn, we recently made the decision to offer every single employee, regardless of their job function or seniority level, an opportunity to work directly with an independent career coach. This investment in personalized development is already showing promising results, with 97% of our employee participants saying they feel more confident in their ability to navigate their careers after coaching. Scale personalized coaching in new ways with the help of AI There is no replacement for one-on-one coaching from a trusted adviser, but that person can’t be there for you 24/7, which is where AI tools can round out your strategy. While many leaders are focused on AI’s impact on productivity, AI for coaching is emerging as the next frontier, with more companies experimenting and seeing early gains. We’re seeing firsthand how more organizations are tapping into our AI-powered coaching features in LinkedIn Learning, with companies like Gates Foundation and Thomson Reuters actively using our new coaching tool to help their managers practice new skills. Companies are already saying this is helping their employees better prepare for that difficult conversation or high stakes presentation. Building a strong culture of coaching will always be rooted in human expertise, but it can be complemented and scaled to new heights with the help of technology. The most valuable skill we can cultivate today isn’t technical—it’s teaching our people how to learn continuously in a rapidly changing world, building resilience that no economic shift or technological disruption can shake. By investing in coaching, you’re not just developing skills—you’re unleashing the uniquely human potential that will define success in the AI era and beyond.",

        "description": "Microsoft’s leading AI assistant Copilot is struggling to match the competition in terms of the popularity of other assistants. The figure for Copilot users continues to remain stagnant at 20 million per week over the past year. The stats come to us thanks to Newcomer, who also mentioned the soaring success of ChatGPT, hitting 400 million weekly users. The data was shared as part of the annual executive meeting in March by the software giant’s CFO. Microsoft raised eyebrows in terms of how it powers Copilot through OpenAI’s models. It also mentioned how many of the features it offers are similar to ChatGPT. Still, that was not good enough to have people running towards Copilot in the same way they approach ChatGPT. Today, the firm has designed Copilot into its Windows 11, Edge, and Microsoft 365. This is without the fact that it’s reaping benefits from the added user growth that’s on the rise at this moment in time. This is why experts feel it’s more important now than ever to revamp Copilot so people approach it with the same or more interest than archrival chatbot assistant like ChatGPT. It also hopes it can take a step back and stop being so dependent on OpenAI. This might be one reason why they’ve opted to hire Mustafa Suleyman and team members from Inflection AI. They are now heading the AI division and have redesigned Copilot. This, combined with new features such as the chance for AI to take action on certain pages, says so much. We might see this as the start of a new cohesive vision, but not something that’s linked to Windows users or any other individual. Remember, the software giant has invested so much in OpenAI to assist the firm’s research division and attain exclusive access to all models. This was to better compete with Android maker Google. Even with such access, they’re still not able to match the competition of ChatGPT, which soars to new heights of success. Remember, ChatGPT is a classic, and we’re not sure people are ready to pull away from the tool just yet and navigate towards Copilot. Microsoft has a lot of work cut out for itself, and only time can tell how far it goes. Image: DIWRead next: Gemini’s Explosive Growth Could Reshape the AI Landscape, but Is It Enough to Win?",

The […] The post What Amazon, Meta, Uber, Anthropic and Others Want in the US AI Action Plan appeared first on PYMNTS.com. As the White House finalizes its AI Action Plan, several tech giants, AI startups and even financial institutions are weighing in. Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Uber, CrowdStrike and JPMorgan Chase are among the thousands that have voiced their views on how the U.S. should regulate artificial intelligence (AI) for growth and innovation. The federal government released all of the comments Thursday (April 24) in a searchable database. OpenAI was one of the earlier submissions, calling for stronger export controls to China but less onerous ones for democratic countries, among other recommendations. Google irked entertainment industry creators and other workers by calling for fair use of copyrighted content — echoed by OpenAI — along with recommendations for government AI adoption. Overall, the submissions show several similarities — the need for infrastructure investment, open innovation and regulatory consistency to unify the patchwork of state laws — though they differ on approach. Read more: OpenAI Calls for Federal Government to Preempt State AI Laws Here’s a roundup of what tech giants, AI startups and other companies want from the Trump administration: Amazon Amazon is pushing for energy infrastructure investments, cloud and chip access, workforce development, federal AI adoption and setting interoperable international standards. Streamline energy regulations: Amazon said AI will require a lot of electricity to power. It advocates for streamlining nuclear power projects and transmission upgrades to keep the U.S. competitive. Lead global talks in AI: Amazon urges the White House to lead in AI efforts globally by promoting global regulatory interoperability through international standards for AI adoption. Educate the workforce in AI: Americans need to be educated on practical AI implementation not just advanced technical training, Amazon says, and the U.S. must invest in more advanced AI researchers and engineers while also enabling workers to use AI tools at work. Transform government agencies using AI: Amazon says federal agencies should leverage AI and the cloud to move away from legacy, on-premises data centers to transform their operations. Anthropic Anthropic projects that as early as late 2026, frontier AI systems may rival Nobel laureates in reasoning ability — and must be treated as national assets. Here are three key items on its wish list: AI threat testing: Anthropic is calling for building robust federal infrastructure for testing powerful models for risks in cybersecurity and development of biological weapons, among others. Strengthen chip export controls: The company supports new restrictions on advanced chips — including the currently exempt Nvidia H20 — and agreements with other countries to prevent smuggling. Energy for AI: Echoing Amazon, Anthropic projects that 50 gigawatts of additional power will be needed by 2027 just for U.S. AI developers. Monitor economic impacts of AI: The U.S. government should enhance its data collection mechanisms to better capture the economic fallout from wider AI adoption, as well as prepare for “significant” changes. Meta Meta’s Llama models are at the heart of its vision for open-source AI leadership and its recommendations to the U.S. government reflect this priority. Don’t stifle open source: Meta calls on the U.S. to resist pressure to regulate or restrict open AI models, warning that doing so would empower authoritarian regimes to fill the vacuum. Federal agency adoption: Meta urges the U.S. government to use open models wherever possible, arguing they are more secure, customizable and better for national security use cases. Fair use clarity: It wants an executive order clarifying that training AI on public data is fair use, which is crucial against copyright lawsuits. This reflects the stances of OpenAI and Google. State rules harm innovation: Meta is warning that fragmented state-level rules will raise compliance costs and stifle innovation. Microsoft Microsoft said the U.S. must stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence, noting that it is investing more than $50 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure in 2025. Enhance computational and energy resources: AI needs a lot of power and the software giant called for modernizing the electric grid, permitting data center construction and enhancing U.S. manufacturing of critical grid components and AI hardware. Access to high-quality data: The company wants to unlock government and other publicly funded data for AI training. Promote trust, safety and national security with AI: Microsoft supports laws targeting deepfake fraud, harnessing AI in defense, and to advance cybersecurity protection. Upskill the U.S. workforce: The company says government should lead national efforts to educate about AI and prepare them for future jobs that will be driven by an AI economy. Mistral AI France-based Mistral, with operations in Palo Alto, Calif., positioned itself as the startup champion for open-source innovation. Support open source: Like Meta, Mistral makes the case that transparency and public access to model weights improve research, security, and democratization of AI development. Weaken monopolies: Mistral advocates for antitrust enforcement, such as those brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to ensure startups and small- to medium-size businesses (SMBs) can compete against incumbents. Enhance global chip trade: Mistral said overregulating chips or AI exports could inadvertently shift innovation to other countries. Global AI cooperation: The firm wants the U.S. to strike a balance — protecting national security while encouraging multinational innovation partnerships that can be mutually beneficial. Uber The ride-hailing company said in its remarks that AI plays an increasingly important role in shaping mobility services. Uber has invested in robust AI governance to ensure accountability in decisions driven by AI. Avoid overregulating low-risk AI: Many mobility-related AI applications pose minimal risk and should not be burdened with complex new rules, Uber says. Stop patchwork of state rules: Uber urges federal preemption to eliminate the growing patchwork of inconsistent state AI laws. Use existing laws first: Current regulations on privacy, discrimination and consumer protection already address most AI-related risks, Uber says. Adopt a risk-based framework: The company says regulations should focus on high-risk use cases and boost innovation in less risky ones such as pricing. CrowdStrike CrowdStrike’s comments center on using and securing AI in the cybersecurity domain. Last year, the cybersecurity company botched an update that cause a global outage of Windows computers and servers. Focus on AI for cybersecurity: CrowdStrike says that the use of AI to detect cyber threats gives the U.S. an “enormous” advantage because it can defeat new threats based on behavior rather than known signatures. Regulation should not stifle innovation: New regulations on AI should not harm innovation and development of new technologies, the company says. Protect the models: The company calls for robust protections around the AI systems themselves and training data for resilience. JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan, which runs more than 500 AI and machine learning systems, calls for greater AI governance. Use existing frameworks: The bank argued that current banking regulations — such as model and third-party risk management, data governance, and privacy — are already well-suited to handle AI. Sector-specific regulation: JPMorgan supports a sector-by-sector approach, where existing financial regulators, such as the OCC or Federal Reserve, lead AI oversight for banks. Level the playing field: The bank wants non-banks offering financial services to be subject to the same standards, especially for AI in credit underwriting and fraud detection. Unify federal and state regulation: JPMorgan echoes the concerns of others about a patchwork of state laws, and calls for the federal government to preempt state laws.

        "description": "The improved Recall still tries to record everything you do on your PC. Nearly a year after announcing the feature, Microsoft is finally ready to roll the controversial Windows Recall feature out to the general public, the company announced today on its Windows Experience Blog. Only available on Copilot+ PCs, a subset of Windows 11 systems sold within the last year or so, Recall takes continuous screenshots of everything you do on your PC, saving them, scraping text from them, and saving it all in a searchable database. This obviously has major security and privacy implications—anyone who can get access to your Recall database can see nearly everything you've done on your PC—which is why Microsoft's initial rollout attempt was such a mess. Recall's long road to release involved a rushed initial almost-launch, harsh criticism of its (then mostly nonexistent) security protections, multiple delays, a major under-the-hood overhaul, and five months of testing in Microsoft's Windows Insider beta program. Microsoft signaled that Recall was nearly ready for release two weeks ago when it came to the near-final Release Preview channel.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The tech industry is often cautious about tying layoffs to performance, even if it might play a role in who gets dismissed during widespread job cuts. But this year has signaled a noticeable shift in how some of the biggest players in tech approach layoffs: Earlier this year, Meta cut more than 3,000 employees in a move that the company framed as “non-regrettable attrition.” The number of Amazon employees on performance improvement plans reportedly surged in recent years, leading up to layoffs—and Microsoft has allegedly cut thousands of employees who were classified as “low performers.” Now Microsoft is giving low performers the option to accept a payout and leave the company rather than being placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP), according to a new Business Insider report. Separation agreement or a PIP An internal email obtained by Business Insider outlined Microsoft’s new performance management system, which the company’s chief people officer described as having “clear expectations and a timeline for improvement.” For those who want to forgo performance management, Microsoft is reportedly offering a separation agreement that would be the equivalent of 16 weeks of pay. (Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment and also declined to comment in response to Business Insider’s inquiries.) Any Microsoft employees who are eligible for a buyout reportedly have five days to accept the offer; if they opt to get on a performance improvement plan instead, they forfeit the option to voluntarily resign and receive a payout at a later time. A previous Business Insider report also claimed that Microsoft is now barring low performers who leave the company or get terminated over performance issues from rejoining for at least two years. Shifting strategies for low performers Microsoft’s new strategy for managing low performers is not unheard of in the tech industry. Amazon uses a program called Pivot that presents similar options to employees who are deemed low performers, and Meta reportedly also employs a “block list” of former employees who should not be hired back by the company. But navigating performance-based layoffs can be tricky: At Meta, some employees who were affected by the recent job cuts claimed they had received high ratings on their performance reviews and expressed frustration over the fact that they were publicly characterized as low performers. (Meta did not comment on all such claims, but in response to one report, a company spokesperson said: “Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations, does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar.”) It’s possible that some of these employees were impacted to meet the 5% quota Meta reportedly set for layoffs across departments, in spite of their performance reviews. Even otherwise, experts say relying solely on performance ratings to determine layoffs can put certain employees at a disadvantage, given the potential bias that is baked into the process. There is also quite a bit of variability across managers and departments, and in some cases employees may not have been performance-managed properly. At a moment when many tech companies are already facing employee dissent and low morale over culture issues—including strict return-to-office mandates—resorting to performance-based layoffs could also engender further mistrust.",

It's harder now, but it's similar tools and determination.\"Concerns have escalated about a collapsing career ladder for younger workers as well as job losses to automation. Yet Kencel doesn't believe that AI will soon be taking the place of software engineers. That trend is \"overhyped,\" he added, and job seekers should avoid allowing it to torpedo their morale.\"I would say, 'remain optimistic,'\" Kencel said. \"Because if you're optimistic about an outcome, it's far more likely that the outcome will actually happen, than if you offer a pessimistic attitude — 'I can't do it, these interviews are too hard.'

With the gap between positions lengthening for many, Kencel acknowledged that being out of a job can be \"hard on the brain\" and can start to grate at a person's sense of worth. Unemployment, he added, is never a reflection of your value.\"Don't let where you're at determine your self-worth as a software engineer, and don't let it get you down,\" he said.There's not a sure-fire way to guarantee success in the course of the search, Kencel said. Instead, it's a \"lot of little things that add up.\" By approaching the hunt from different angles, seekers better their overall chances of success, he said.\"It's not going to be like a great project you made, or you have a great website for yourself, or one connection you made,\" Kencel said. \"It's a lot of those little things.\"Kencel suggested treating failure as an opportunity to switch approaches. If something isn't working out, it could be time to try a new tack rather than continuing to apply the same way.\"Don't give up. 'Cause it's hard and it can be discouraging at times, but if you experience some sort of failure, just rework your strategy,\" he said.As for more actionable advice on how to stand out in a crowded market, Kencel suggests getting out from behind the computer screen and attending relevant local events as often as possible. Broadening the search to include in-person jobs could also prove beneficial, he said.\"I feel like going to actual in-person events and lining up roles like that in your pipeline is important,\" he said. \"Remote gets so many applicants.

        "description": "Companies like Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are using large amounts of water to meet the energy demands of their data center, and they have used a lot of water in the last four years, which is impacting the environment negatively. After collecting environmental and sustainability reports in 2024 by these companies, it was found that most of the water consumption was done by Google in 2023. Google used 24 million cubic meters of water in 2023, which is equivalent to filling 26 Olympic-sized pools every day in a year. If we compare this water consumption to how much an average man consumes in his average lifespan, it's only 25 cubic meters of water. Google uses water that 1,300 people consume in their whole life in just one day. Even though other companies used less water than Google, it's still a large amount. Microsoft used 7.8 million cubic meters of water in 2023, which is equivalent to filling 9 Olympic pools every day, while Apple consumed 6 million cubic meters of water, from which 7 Olympic pools can be filled every day. 3 million cubic meters of water were used by Meta in 2023, which is the least out of the big four companies.Also read: What Countries Are Leading In Investment In AI? The 2025 Index Report Reveals!132,344,557 cubic meters of water were used by Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Google from 2020 to 2023. Which is equivalent to 52,938 Olympic-sized pools in total, or 13,234 pools annually, with average daily consumption reaching 36 pools. Microsoft’s water consumption increased by 87% from 2020 to 2023, with Google’s water consumption increasing by 69%, Meta’s by 40%, and Apple’s by 25% from 2020 to 2023. In the coming years, these companies aims to go water‑positive by funding clean‑water projects and maximizing onsite water reuse. .

        "description": "The modding community is already hard at work despite lack of \"official\" support. Bethesda isn't officially supporting mods for the newly released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches. As noted on Reddit and the Bethesda Game Studios Discord, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original Oblivion have the same effect when plugged into the new Remastered game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using a mod uploaded in 2008 to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the Remastered version. While players of the original game could use the Oblivion Mod Manager to easily install these mods, doing so in the Remastered version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the \"Content/Dev/ObvData/Data\" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like \"DLCHorseArmor.esp\"). Then it's just a matter of opening \"Plugins.txt\" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.Read full article Comments",

But that excitement may have been tinged with at least a little bit of trepidation for the team behind Skyblivion, a volunteer-run project that has spent years trying to \"port and rebuild\" 2007's Oblivion into the updated engine from 2016's remastered Skyrim: Special Edition. Fortunately for the Skyblivion team, Bethesda has apparently decided there's room enough in this world for both official and unofficial remakes of Oblivion. The team took to social media Tuesday to thank Bethesda for \"their continued support\" and for \"the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team.\" \"To clear up any confusion Bethesda made it clear that they have no intention of shutting down our project,\" the team added in a social media reply.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Microsoft released its annual Work Trend Index report on Tuesday, which argued that 2025 is the year that companies stop simply experimenting with AI and start building it into key missions. As part of its release, Microsoft put together a glossary that it says is comprised of “new terms to know for a new world of work.” Here’s the list: Agent: An AI-powered system that can reason, plan, and act to complete tasks or entire workflows autonomously, with human oversight at key moments. Agent boss: A human manager of one or more agents. Capacity gap: The deficit between business demands and the maximum capacity of humans alone to meet them. Digital labor: AI or agents that can be purchased on demand to scale workforce capacity. Frontier Firm: A company powered by intelligence on tap, human-agent teams, and a new role for everyone: agent boss. Human-agent ratio: A new business metric that optimizes the balance of human oversight with agent efficiency on human-agent teams. Intelligence resources: A function dedicated to managing digital labor on an organizational level—think of it as a blend of IT and HR. Work Chart: The next org chart, structured not around functional expertise but around jobs that need to be done.",

        "description": "Artificial intelligence has rapidly started finding its place in the workplace, but this year will be remembered as the moment when companies pushed past simply experimenting with AI and started building around it, Microsoft said in a blog post accompanying its annual Work Trend Index report. As part of this shift, Microsoft is dubbing 2025 the year of the “Frontier Firm.” “Like the digital native companies of a generation ago, they understand the power of pairing irreplaceable human insight with AI and agents to unlock outsized value,” Jared Spataro, CMO of AI at Work at Microsoft, said in the post. These so-called Frontier Firms will be built around “on-demand intelligence and powered by ‘hybrid’ teams of humans + agents, these companies scale rapidly, operate with agility, and generate value faster,” according to the report. Microsoft argued that within the next two to five years, every company will be on the journey to becoming one. Microsoft said that 82% of leaders responded that this is a “pivotal” year to rethink key strategy and operations, while 81% said they expect agents to be “moderately or extensively” integrated into their AI strategies in the next 12 to 18 months. The results are a culmination of survey data from 31,000 workers across 31 countries, LinkedIn hiring and labor market trends, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and conversations with experts, and AI-native startups. Microsoft expects the transition to the Frontier Firm to play out in three phases. The first, it said, is that AI will act as an assistant to streamline work tasks. Second is the addition of AI agents as “digital colleagues,” which can take on specific tasks. The third step calls for a lot more freedom: it’s when humans set direction for agents that run entire business processes and workflows, with the human checking in as needed. It gives the example of a supply chain role. Agents can handle end-to-end logistics, while humans can guide the agents, resolve exceptions, and manage supplier relationships. AI agents are still in the early days, but companies are placing big bets that agentic AI represents the next major frontier and are rapidly innovating. OpenAI recently released “Operator,” a tool that automates web-based tasks, along with Deep Research, which it says can gather information from across the web and summarize it into digestible reports. Amazon launched a model designed to take over a user’s web browser and perform simple tasks. Anthropic, the creator of Claude, and Google have also introduced AI agents. “This shift is multifaceted—every industry and role will evolve differently as the technology diffuses across business and society,” the report said. “Just as the internet era created billions of new knowledge jobs—from social media managers to UX designers—the AI era is already giving rise to new roles, with many more to come.”",

        "description": "Computer experts at Microsoft Research have done a great job of rolling out a new AI model that runs across regular CPUs, instead of the usual GPU. The news is major because it’s something rare in today's time. The latest efforts are published in a new paper that outlines how exactly the masterpiece came into play, what features are on offer, and performance stats during the testing phase. Over the past couple of years, LLMs have been the rage, and we’ve seen models from ChatGPT to more get fame for all the right reasons. The idea of chatbots is incredible, and each day, there’s something new on offer. One thing that they all have in common is the use and training of GPU chips. This has to do with the huge computing power needed for training on such big data collections. Recently, concerns were on the rise about the huge energy consumption used by data centers and how they were more harmful and costly than anything else. Therefore, the Microsoft team seems to have found the best solution for data processing, and now there’s a model that really proves their claims true. One of the most energy-draining parts on offer here is how weights are stored and how they’re used. There’s so much memory involved, and the same goes for the processing of the CPU. The alternative approach involved floating numbers and using what they call a 1-bit architecture. In the latest innovation, the weights get stored as three single values, and this only includes simple math of adding or subtracting for the processing. All of these operations are done through the CPU. The latest model’s test showed that it was a fierce competition against other GPU models in the same class size. They could outperform a bunch of those, and it would use less memory and less energy.To run these models, the team produced runtime environments. It’s dubbed Bitnet.cpp, which is designed to use a 1-bit architecture. Now the question if these claims will hold up until the end. If the answer is yes, then you can say hello to a game-changing opportunity. You don’t need to rely too heavily on the likes of big data companies. Users might run a single chatbot on a PC or perhaps a phone. Such LLM processing that’s more localized can also better protect privacy and enable performance without any internet connection. How brilliant would that be? Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Apple Accused of Misleading Users about AI Features on iPhone 16",

This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans.\"Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Digestion or indigestion?Miller's comments aim to position the pause not as a red flag, but as part of the normal ebb and flow of data center growth.Historically, these digestion periods, marked by slowing new leases or deferred builds, can last 6 to 12 months before a rebound, the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Google, for instance, pulled back from leasing in the second half of 2024, only to return aggressively in early 2025, they noted.The Cowen analysts said Amazon's recent cautious moves to pull back on colocation deals may be related to efforts to increase efficiency across its data center operations. Also, AWS typically doesn't do a lot of colocation deals anyway, preferring instead to build its own data centers, the analysts wrote.They also wrote that other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, are still aggressively pursuing new capacity.The bottom line? While AWS appears to be taking a breath, the AI cloud race is far from over. Analysts and investors will watch closely to see whether this pause marks a brief recalibration or a more significant shift in AI strategy.Read the original article on Business Insider Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman.AmazonWall Street analysts say Amazon has paused some data center deals.The data center market may be slightly cooling, after a frenzied couple of years.Microsoft has also taken its foot off the AI accelerator a bit recently.First, it was Microsoft.

AWS and Microsoft are pausing or slowing down the development of data centers, according to a Wells Fargo research note shared with PYMNTS. Several industry sources told Wells Fargo’s analysts team that AWS has “paused a portion of its leading discussions” on colocated data centers, particularly those abroad. “It’s not clear the magnitude of the pause, but the positioning is similar to what we’ve heard recently from Microsoft,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Eric Luebchow in the Monday (April 21) note. Last week, Noelle Walsh, president of Microsoft Cloud Operations and Innovation, disclosed in a LinkedIn post that the software giant is “slowing or pausing some early-stage projects” as it refines the buildout of cloud capacity relative to customer demand. Microsoft has doubled its data center capacity in the last three years and is on track to spend the budgeted amount of $80 billion or more in 2025 “informed by near-term and long-term demand signals,” Walsh said in the post. Microsoft has more than 350 data centers in at least 60 regions globally. Meanwhile, Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, explained in a LinkedIn post that the change in the hyperscaler’s data center plans is “routine capacity management, and there haven’t been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans.” AWS continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads,” he said in the post. Wells Fargo’s Luebchow acknowledged that “it’s not clear yet” that AWS’ slowing of lease signing “is an area of concern or just the natural ebbs and flows of hyperscale activity.” AWS has 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. Read also: Nvidia and xAI Sign On to $30 Billion AI Infrastructure Fund Other Hyperscalers Remain Active Luebchow said other major data center owners — Meta, Google and Oracle — remain “active” while Nvidia is showing “elevated activity.” This does not include the $500 billion Stargate project to build artificial intelligence data centers, which is a partnership among OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX, plus technical alliances with other companies, the analyst said. It also does not include Apple’s own data center plans, which are ramping up over the next four years, according to the research note. The surge in data center construction is the result of explosive growth in AI, cloud services and digital infrastructure needs. The demand for AI tools like ChatGPT is driving a need for massive computing power and storage, which means the necessity for more data centers. Global data center capacity is expected to grow at 15% per year until 2027, which is forecast to be insufficient to meet growing demand, according to real estate services company JLL. Driven by AI advancements, “global data center construction currently stands at record levels,” JLL said in its 2025 Global Data Center Outlook. “All signals suggest that AI demand will continue to build momentum in 2025.” However, the experience of China is a cautionary tale. After ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November 2022, there was a rush of data center buildout in China as growing demand for AI made the country seem like a sound bet, MIT Technology Review reported in March. In 2023 and 2024, more than 500 new data center projects were announced in China. At least 150 were operational by the end of last year, per the report. But the rise of DeepSeek, which offered a more economical way to train and use AI models, along with faltering economics around AI, is putting a crimp on the industry, according to the report. Many data centers also were constructed hastily and did not meet industry standards.

Motorola phones that are soon to be released will feature an assortment of artificial intelligence (AI) apps, including those from Perplexity AI, Microsoft and Google, a Google executive reportedly told a court Tuesday (April 22). Testifying in the Justice Department’s antitrust case against Google, Peter Fitzgerald, vice president of platforms and device partnerships at Google, shared this news to support the company’s claims that there are options available to customers, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Samsung is also in talks to add several AI apps to its phones, Fitzgerald said, per the report. Fitzgerald also told the court, according to the report, that Google sent letters to phone manufacturers and U.S. wireless carriers last week, clarifying that its contracts don’t prevent them from installing other companies’ voice assistants or generative AI apps. In this antitrust trial, Google is arguing against a breakup of the company, while the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are advocating for the remedies they have proposed for Google’s dominance in the search market. The trial is being heard by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, the same judge who ruled in August that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in the search business with practices like paying Apple to make its search engine the default option on that company’s devices. The changes proposed by the Justice Department include forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser, license search data to competitors and stop paying other companies to make its products the primary choice on their devices and services. It was reported Tuesday that Perplexity AI has been asked to testify during this remedies phase of the trial and that the company is using its platform to speak out against the proposed structural remedies. Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a Monday (April 21) post on X: “The DOJ is pushing for Chrome to be divested from Google. We don’t believe anyone else can run a browser at that scale without a hit on quality, nor the business model to be able to serve that many users profitably by keeping the browser free. Chromium is open source, and others can build using that. Evidence: Microsoft Edge and Perplexity’s upcoming Comet browser.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Efficiency has replaced perks and pampering, as performance-based job cuts become more of a regular occurrence.For instance, Mark Zuckerberg targeted low performers when Meta eliminated thousands of jobs earlier this year. And, similar to Microsoft's new policy, Meta puts ousted employees on \"block lists\" that stop them getting rehired. Earlier this year, Microsoft fired 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as part of changes to the company's performance review and management process, insiders told BI.Coleman's email, in full below, details some of those changes and suggests others on the horizon. Microsoft declined to comment.Read the full email to Microsoft managers:Managers,Thank you for your patience yesterday with the unexpected technical product issues. As customer zero, this was an opportunity to learn and quickly make improvements.As Satya shared at the recent Employee Town Hall, our success as a company depends on our relevance in year 51 and beyond - in terms of our innovation, the products we deliver, and the impact we have for our customers and partners. With that, our focus remains on enabling high performance to achieve our priorities spanning security, quality, and leading Al. This focus and our growth mindset encourage excellence, motivates us to push ourselves through challenges, and enables us to deliver results.Today, we're rolling out new and enhanced tools to help you accelerate high performance and swiftly address low performance. Our goal is to create a globally consistent and transparent experience for employees and managers (subject to local laws and consultation). These tools will also help foster a culture of accountability and growth by enabling you to address performance challenges with clarity and empathy.Manager Readiness: FY25 Performance, Connect and Rewards: Register for a 60-minute virtual, facilitated session to dive deeper into the performance landscape at Microsoft. Each session will explore what's new for FY25 rewards, provide guidance on differentiating rewards outcomes, and define what it means to deliver \"significant impact.\" Next week, you'll also see a mail from Performance and Development to all employees with more details on Connects.Clarity and Transparency in Rewards: This year, we'll ensure more transparency and clarity in the Rewards process for managers including additional guidance for each rewards outcome and showing payout percentages to help you make decisions that align with our high-performance expectations. More Rewards details will be shared by the end of the month.Performance Improvement Process: If an employee is not meeting expectations, you can use the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), a new globally consistent approach to set clear expectations and a timeline for improvement. The employee can accept the improvement plan or choose to transition out of the company with the offer of a Global Voluntary Separation Agreement (GVSA). This performance improvement process is available year-round so you can act quickly to transparently address performance issues, while offering employees choice.Updated Internal Movement/External Rehire Policy: Employees with zero and 60% Rewards outcomes and/or on an active PIP will not be eligible for internal transfers. Former employees who left with zero or 60% Rewards or during/after a PIP will not be eligible for rehire until two years after their termination date.Manager Excellence Initiatives: Additionally, in the coming months, we'll launch several initiatives to strengthen how we measures manage, and motivate teams to deliver for our customers. You'll have access to scenario-based, Al-supported tools designed to help you prepare for constructive or challenging conversations by practicing in an interactive environment.Thank you for your leadership and commitment to driving high performance and accountability across your team.

        "description": "iStock; Rebecca Zisser/BIGenerative AI is reshaping enterprise software, challenging traditional SaaS models.AI agents are evolving from assistants to core applications, impacting mid-market companies.Mid-size SaaS vendors face pressure from AI-native startups and tech giants like Microsoft, AlixPartners says.A foundational shift is underway in enterprise software, and it's being driven by generative AI.The rise of reasoning models and AI agents is beginning to erode the core assumptions that have defined the software-as-a-service business model for decades, according to a new study released on Monday by AlixPartners.The consulting firm warned that this is squeezing more than 100 mid-market software companies, which are stuck in the midst of a powerful trend.These companies are caught in a \"big squeeze,\" pressured on one side by nimble, AI-native entrants that can replicate applications at a fraction of the cost and on the other side by tech behemoths, such as Microsoft and Salesforce, that are pouring billions of dollars into the AI arms race, AlixPartners said.\"We believe many mid-size enterprise software companies will face threats to their survival over the next 24 months,\" the firm added ominously. It declined to identify specific companies, given the sensitive nature of its findings.AI: the new foundation, not just a featureThe most mature uses of AI in enterprise software today include copilots for software coding, such as GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, and support chatbots like Zendesk's Answer Bot. But these could be just the beginning. Generative AI is advancing from narrow use cases to the broader \"logic and presentation layers\" of software, the very foundation that traditional SaaS tools are built on, AlixPartners explained in the study.This means AI agents are no longer just assistants within applications; they are becoming the applications themselves. These agents are capable of handling complex tasks, such as scheduling meetings, analyzing reports, and creating code, with little need for a graphical interface or structured workflow. And because they can run across various data types without needing extensive data normalization, they could render some traditional SaaS layers redundant.\"This shift could eliminate the need for many enterprise software companies that thrived in the traditional SaaS architecture,\" AlixPartners said.A new threat from both sidesThis puts mid-size SaaS vendors in a tricky position, the firm explained, citing a recent analysis it conducted of 122 publicly listed enterprise software companies with annual revenue below $10 billion.It found that sales growth has slowed considerably lately. For instance, the percentage of high-growth companies in this group decreased from 57% in 2023 to 39% in 2024. This year, industry analysts are expecting further declines, indicating that only 27% of companies will be in the high-growth category.AlixPartners also highlighted that software customers are moving around more than before. The median net dollar retention rate of enterprise software companies dropped from 120% in 2021 to 108% in the third quarter of 2024, the firm noted, citing data from Bank of America. (NDR is a common way to measure customer stickiness. When it's above 100%, that indicates revenue from existing customers is growing, while an NDR below 100% suggests revenue is declining from these sources.)Many of these companies are now being undercut by AI-powered challengers with lower costs and faster iteration cycles. Simultaneously, larger players are integrating AI into their broader platforms, offering bundled functionality at lower price points through economies of scale, according to the consulting firm.Klarna's recent decision to drop Salesforce and Workday in favor of smaller AI-powered vendors and in-house agents is a sign of where this trend may be headed, AlixPartners noted.The SaaS model: ripe for reinventionTraditional SaaS depends heavily on the user interface, structured data workflows, and seat-based pricing. But AI agents don't need dashboards, and they can function without rigid data hierarchies. This calls into question the relevance of the SaaS model itself, according to AlixPartners.AlixPartnersSome companies are already pivoting. Salesforce and ServiceNow have begun experimenting with outcome-based pricing for AI agents, where fees are tied to results, not user counts.Among those 122 mid-sized software companies, AlixPartners found that half expect significant changes to business models in the next year.At the same time, the compute costs associated with running AI agents can be significantly higher than for classic SaaS tools, making profit margin compression a potential threat. Software providers may need to rethink infrastructure strategies, possibly shifting to more efficient inference architectures, industry experts have warned recently.Meanwhile, higher interest rates and tightening capital markets in recent years have put the onus on SaaS profitability, not just growth. Software companies have responded by cutting costs, optimizing portfolios, and rethinking pricing strategies.According to the AlixPartners report, more than 60% of executives are now focused on AI as a growth driver. Unlocking that growth requires more than just product tweaks, it may require transformation across operations, go-to-market models, and customer relationships, the consulting firm suggested.How to survive: a new playbookSo what's the path forward? The report discusses several strategic imperatives. Here are a few:Build AI agents: Not as bolt-on features, but as core products.Transform the business model: Move beyond a seat-based fee structure to usage- or outcome-based pricing.Streamline and focus: Shed low-growth products and reallocate R&D to AI development.Lean into M&A: For some, the best route may be to get acquired or consolidate.In a world where generative AI tools can write or replicate software pretty well, differentiation must come from speed, relevance, and efficiency, not UI design or legacy feature sets.The software era isn't ending. But the SaaS era, as we know it, is evolving. The next generation of enterprise tools may not be applications, they could be agents. And only the most adaptable companies will make the leap, according to AlixPartners.Read the original article on Business Insider iStock; Rebecca Zisser/BIGenerative AI is reshaping enterprise software, challenging traditional SaaS models.AI agents are evolving from assistants to core applications, impacting mid-market companies.Mid-size SaaS vendors face pressure from AI-native startups and tech giants like Microsoft, AlixPartners says.A foundational shift is underway in enterprise software, and it's being driven by generative AI.The rise of reasoning models and AI agents is beginning to erode the core assumptions that have defined the software-as-a-service business model for decades, according to a new study released on Monday by AlixPartners.The consulting firm warned that this is squeezing more than 100 mid-market software companies, which are stuck in the midst of a powerful trend.These companies are caught in a \"big squeeze,\" pressured on one side by nimble, AI-native entrants that can replicate applications at a fraction of the cost and on the other side by tech behemoths, such as Microsoft and Salesforce, that are pouring billions of dollars into the AI arms race, AlixPartners said.\"We believe many mid-size enterprise software companies will face threats to their survival over the next 24 months,\" the firm added ominously.

        "description": "Global tech giant Microsoft just issued a host of security rules that will come into play by May, 5th. With only days remaining, nearly half a billion users are expected to be affected by the change. The company is taking into consideration the growing threats linked to emails, where bad actors continue to share phishing attacks and beyond without the user knowing. Many of us resort to sending emails every single day, and that is making this threat very real. These are malicious spam floods that cause serious security problems.Microsoft says it's focusing more on the domain for Outlook users, Live users, and those using Hotmail. May 5th is when they come into play, and users need to be aware of what to do to remain safe and keep using their services with ease. Google is already working on this front by taking action against those sending out malware in bulk through Gmail accounts. This really affects the users’ security for Gmail by rolling out new sender authentication requirements. The point to make here is that such rules reduce the risk of criminals making use of unauthenticated domains to provide dangerous material like payloads.So, software giant Microsoft seems to be following in their footsteps by sharing similar rules that reduce the probability of spam arising. The same goes for spoofing campaigns that reach the user base, as per an announcement shared on April 2 by Windows Defender through a blog.The rules from May 5 feature Sender Policy Framework, Reporting, Conformation, and Domain Keys identified as the leading requirements. The noncompliant texts would first be linked to Junk and get rejected if the problems aren’t resolved. In case you happen to be sending marketing things, you should be paying heed as time is running out.The complete email authentication was explained, but here are some bullet reference points to remember. The email will pass the sending domain and DNS record; it needs to validate email integrity and authenticity checks. Lastly, it needs to align with DKIM or SPF.As shared by experts, the goal right now is to add measures that limit spoofing, spam, and phishing attempts. They also empower people to have stronger brand protection and deliverability rates. This is a direct reflection of statements made by the company in terms of rolling out mandatory strong email authenticators to keep users safe on Gmail.If you are to meet this deadline, companies need to set up email IDs to get the reports of DMARC. Once that’s done, the reports keep getting received as part of the DMARC protocol to keep you safe. Hence, if you are a bulk sender of emails through Microsoft Outlook, you might need to take action now rather than later, as time is ticking.

Google is upgrading Workspace, its rival to Microsoft 365, by embedding more artificial intelligence (AI) and other functionality into the platform. Workspace includes Google’s Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Meet, Google Drive, Slides, Calendar and other tools many workers use globally. Here are the Workspace updates Google recently announced: Google Sheets Adds New AI Analyst Google built an AI analyst to help workers make sense of data in Google Sheets. The “Help me analyze” AI assistant helps employees get started, points out trends that they might have missed, recommends next steps for deeper insights and creates interactive charts to visualize the data. “Help me analyze” is coming to Sheets later this year. (PYMNTS reached out to Google to get a more specific release date.) Also, Google recently rolled out a feature in Sheets enabling users to generate “deeper” insights about trends or patterns between different data points and generate visual “heatmaps,” in addition to charts. For example, a marketing manager analyzing a retail ad campaign can ask Gemini to produce insights and create a chart about the best three performing marketing channels by conversion rate, according to Google. Gemini can generate the report, along with visuals like distribution plots to analyze channel performance.

It can help with research preparation ahead of a client meeting. It then generates detailed reports, which come with links to sources, and users can ask questions about the findings. These reports can be exported to Google Docs and shared with colleagues. Use cases for Deep Research include market analysis, product comparisons, academic research and more. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is Google’s most capable AI model to date. Google Drive to Offer Video Transcripts Last year, Google Drive got the ability to automatically generate captions for uploaded videos. Now, Google is adding video transcripts to videos in Google Drive. Users can now view and search transcripts, which appear in a side bar next to the video player. It highlights the text as it is being spoken. This capability makes it easier to find specific moments in videos. NotebookLM Is Coming to Google Docs Google’s popular audio overview tool, NotebookLM, is being integrated into Google Docs. NotebookLM takes any documents and turns it into a 2-person AI-generated podcast. In Docs, NotebookLM can create either full audio versions of documents in Docs or turn them into podcasts. The capability will be arriving in coming weeks. Google Docs, Gmail and Google Meet Add More Languages Docs’ AI-powered “Help me write” feature supports English, French, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Portugese and German. Gmail can help write emails in eight languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese Korean, Japanese, Italian, French and German. Google’s video conferencing platform, Google Meet, is also adding more languages for taking notes. It is available in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish.

        "description": "Future AI might not need supercomputers thanks to models like BitNet b1.58 2B4T. When it comes to actually storing the numerical weights that power a large language model's underlying neural network, most modern AI models rely on the precision of 16- or 32-bit floating point numbers. But that level of precision can come at the cost of large memory footprints (in the hundreds of gigabytes for the largest models) and significant processing resources needed for the complex matrix multiplication used when responding to prompts. Now, researchers at Microsoft's General Artificial Intelligence group have released a new neural network model that works with just three distinct weight values: -1, 0, or 1. Building on top of previous work Microsoft Research published in 2023, the new model's \"ternary\" architecture reduces overall complexity and \"substantial advantages in computational efficiency,\" the researchers write, allowing it to run effectively on a simple desktop CPU. And despite the massive reduction in weight precision, the researchers claim that the model \"can achieve performance comparable to leading open-weight, full-precision models of similar size across a wide range of tasks.\" Watching your weights The idea of simplifying model weights isn't a completely new one in AI research. For years, researchers have been experimenting with quantization techniques that squeeze their neural network weights into smaller memory envelopes. In recent years, the most extreme quantization efforts have focused on so-called \"BitNets\" that represent each weight in a single bit (representing +1 or -1).Read full article Comments",

        "description": "I’m a journalist, and the first 30 minutes of my day used to be spent mainlining newsfeeds. Now, more often than not, it’s dedicated to LinkedIn. Such is the natural course of technology; I seek an engaged audience for pieces built on considered thought. And I discovered the pseudo social network that I’d once found cringe is actually full of smart people—who crop up if I’m willing to spend a bit of extra time sharing my writing with them. We are now in the era of the AI-born LinkedIn expert. Their mastery is dropping a story into ChatGPT and asking for a perky LinkedIn post summarizing it. (LinkedIn even has its own AI writing assistant that encourages people to “Rewrite with AI” to serve up this slop.) They snatch the thoughts and research of others, reconstitute it, and present it as their own. Even when they source a link, the new work is still oddly pre-chewed. A steak transformed into mechanically processed meat. But honestly, it’s not the plagiarism lite that gets to me most. And LinkedIn is hardly the only spot you’ll find people publishing AI-drafted copy. Beyond the Great Truncation at the heart of Zoom meeting summaries, I can tell the pitch emails I receive are increasingly written with the help of AI, while companies like Microsoft promote Copilot to help write corporate memos (and LinkedIn posts!). It seems every designer I know is using AI to write about their projects, and Canva just unveiled tools to batch write ads for you in about every language on earth. This is all *fine* [the room around me beginning to smoke but not in full flames yet]. Not every pitch deck needs to be a Shakespearean sonnet. Even language specialists will tell you that a lot of writing is formulaic, which is a reason why predictive autocomplete technologies have been so accurate for so long. I used to fear that AI would trap each of us into our own universe. Now I’m imagining a future that’s far more mundane. It’s one where I use AI to write you a thing. Then you have your AI summarize it. Then you have your AI write back. And then my AI summarizes it. Why wasn’t it all just summarized in the first place? Does anyone need to have a full thought ever again? Don’t take me as some Luddite denying the current impact or supreme possibilities lurking inside generative AI. We consolidated all our knowledge into the internet, which we used to train humanity’s synthesizer. Life is gonna be messy for a while. But I’m not just a curmudgeonly old writer who is threatened by a machine that can pump out copy even faster than I can. (And ask my editors; I’m lightning.) What is so insulting to me about those AI-written messages is that they take less time and consideration to produce than they do to consume. You are, by the nature of sharing these automated words, signaling to me that you care less about my time and attention than you do your own. Of course you’re free to believe that as much as you like—in your own head. Just don’t drop it into my inbox or feed. Because that’s rude. In a way, an AI-generated image or advertisement is less offensive to me, because we look at most digital ads for a second or less (with a mere 4% commanding our attention for a full two). To everyone in marketing and graphic design, please do not cancel your weekend plans to get 10 additional microseconds of my engagement! Who cares? (Apologies, I really do enjoy a great ad.) Reading simply takes longer than visual processing. It inherently asks more of an audience. Presenting a friend or colleague with a note an AI wrote is like inviting them over for dinner and microwaving a Stouffer’s. An AI post on LinkedIn is bringing that same microwaved dinner to a potluck. You should be embarrassed in either case! Not by your lack of skill or practice in putting together words, but your lack of respect for not even trying. Now, in full fairness, I will acknowledge that this faux pas is not all your fault. The omnipresent do-anything button of AI is certainly tempting. And companies including OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are encouraging such behavior while hoping to prove out their investment in AI tools. They will addict us to automation even when it’s uncouth because there’s no business plan in the world built on moderation. The truth, however, is if something isn’t worth you writing it, there’s about no way in hell it’s worth me reading it.",

        "description": "E-commerce CEOs are posting daily on LinkedIn, making the rounds on Bloomberg and CNBC, or writing letters to their representatives to warn of the dangers the current tariffs system poses. Two weeks ago, Michael Wieder, the co-founder and president of baby brand Lalo, was on CNBC’s Squawk Box talking about how tariffs would impact his brand, which sells high chairs, play sets and more. Since then, he said he has had dozens of reporters reach out wanting to talk to him about tariffs. He doesn’t have time to take all of their calls, he said, but, “I’m willing to speak to anybody, … because it’s really, really important that we help educate how and why things are made.” He said he’s also reached out to politicians on both sides of the aisle. Most CEOs of small- to medium-sized e-commerce businesses are in a similar boat right now. They’ve spent the past two weeks going on a traditional or non-traditional media blitz, warning of potentially dire consequences: namely, that thousands of companies could go out of business if the current tariffs system — which includes 145% tariffs on most goods imported from China, 10% tariffs on all imports, 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, higher tariffs that are currently paused and the revocation of the de minimis exemption — stays in place.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said he turned down offers from Yahoo, Microsoft, and Netscape when he graduated from college.Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunchMatthew Prince told BI he wishes he had worked at a Big Tech company out of college.Prince said he turned down offers from Yahoo, Microsoft, and Netscape to pursue law school.He said those jobs can accelerate your career and help grow your network.What advice does Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wish he could tell his younger self? Be open to getting experience at a big company before going to grad school.As the cofounder and CEO of a multibillion-dollar cybersecurity firm, Prince said he feels pretty content about the career moves he made — but he wishes he hadn't turned down the job offers he got out of college.\"Figuring out a way to get to some company that's somewhere between 2,000 and 20,000 employees, and is working on interesting projects — that's the thing that I wish I had,\" the Cloudflare CEO said in an interview with Business Insider.After getting a Bachelor's degree in English literature and computer science, the CEO said he had offers to go to Yahoo, Microsoft, and Netscape. Prince said he turned them down because he was \"an arrogant young kid\" who had his mind set on becoming a cybersecurity lawyer. He ended up starting law school at the University of Chicago the year after he graduated, and went on to teach law after he got his degree.At the time of the three job offers, the dot-com boom was in full swing, and companies like Microsoft were at the forefront of innovation. Prince said the three companies offered him the opportunity to work at a fast-growing company with \"a bunch of interesting problems\" and \"some real scale.\" He also said he thinks he could have grown a larger network of colleagues if he had taken one of the jobs.\"The camaraderie and the rolodex and the interesting people that you will meet in that, is just such a huge accelerant to your career,\" Prince told BI.Prince said he doesn't regret turning down later positions that didn't appeal to him, such as an offer to be a bankruptcy attorney when he wanted to be a securities lawyer. He also said he still finds value in his law degree, even if he isn't actively practicing it, because he understands the legal challenges his company has to solve.But he said his advice to his younger self stems more from the missed experience of working at a fast-growing company with a large network of colleagues. Nowadays, that may look like a Stripe or Twin Base, he said.While Prince said it would've been interesting to see where those opportunities led, he may have dodged a bullet. The dot-com bubble eventually burst, and by staying focused on his own path, he was able to launch a company that merged his interests and degrees.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "What’s in your office starter pack? La Colombe cold brew and a New Yorker subscription? Bose headphones and Brooks Brothers? Thanks to the latest ChatGPT trend making the rounds, you can now find out. By uploading a few photos and using a specific prompt, OpenAI’s GPT-4o image generator will spit out a personalized action figure or Barbie box in your likeness—complete with miniature accessories and sealed in plastic. In the past week, the trend has started popping up across TikTok, X, and—where trends go to die—Facebook and LinkedIn. “The Strategic Data & AI Consultant Starter Pack – Now in limited-edition blister packaging,” one LinkedIn user wrote alongside their post. “Unleash Your Inner Leader: The ‘Passion-Driven AI Impact’ Starter Pack!” wrote another. A marketing agency in Texas called it “a cute way to re-introduce yourself to your audience, re-introduce your employees, or even make an ‘action figure,’ (or a few ‘action figures,’) of what your ideal target audience/consumer looks like.” Brands like Starbucks and NYX Cosmetics have also jumped on the trend. Even Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted her own AI-generated figure, complete with Bible and gavel. The Congresswoman MTG Starter Kit ✨ If I was a doll! I love all my accessories, including my Bible and gavel for DOGE Committee chair! pic.twitter.com/2fEWYH1Ubt— Marjorie Taylor Greene (@mtgreenee) April 10, 2025 As with other recent AI trends, reception has been mixed. “People on LinkedIn turning themselves into cheap, plastic, replaceable products is the least surprising thing,” one X user posted. “Can we please stop mass using AI to create social media trends (for example, the action figure trend happening rn)?” another wrote. People on LinkedIn turning themselves into cheap, plastic, replaceable products is the least surprising thing.— akreon (@_akreon_) April 10, 2025 The counter-hashtag #StarterPackNoAI quickly began circulating among creatives pushing back against what they see as the erosion of artistic labor. The starter pack trend follows closely on the heels of the controversial Studio Ghibli AI trend, which sparked debate over whether OpenAI was unfairly using the work of artists, including Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki. Environmental and cultural concerns aside, some users simply hate to see the TikTokification of LinkedIn. “Went over to LinkedIn for a break from tariff world is ending doomscrolling. Got a feed full of ‘I made myself an action figure,’” another X user complained. “Take me back doomscrollers.”",

You can just write a prompt into Copilot or ChatGPT or similar tools, and it will likely write you a basic webpage, or a small application, a game in Python,\" Dohmke said. \"And so, AI makes software development so much more accessible for anyone who wants to learn coding.\"AI, Dohmke said, helps to \"realize the dream\" of bringing an idea to life, meaning that fewer projects will end up dead in the water, and smaller teams of developers will be enabled to tackle larger-scale projects. Dohmke said he believes it makes the overall process of creation more efficient.\"You see some of the early signs of that, where very small startups — sometimes five developers and some of them actually only one developer — believe they can become million, if not billion dollar businesses by leveraging all the AI agents that are available to them,\" he added.Dohmke isn't the only tech leader to have identified the potential for leaner workforces — Garry Tan, CEO and president of famed Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, previously said he believes AI-assisted coding, or \"vibe coding,\" now allows 10 or so engineers to build what would've once required the efforts of \"50 or 100.\" Shrinking tech teams, however, could mean even fewer openings in software development, leading to anxiety around job replacement.\"The anxiety is understandable, but time and again, developers have discovered how to channel the new capabilities into entire domains of innovation that didn't exist before,\" Dohmke wrote in a January blog post. \"They have always used automation to make their life easier.\"Though the tools are new, the mindset that GitHub's CEO said will best allow programmers to take advantage of them is anything but. For those already in the industry, Dohmke advises retaining a sense of curiosity and using everything on hand to continually sharpen their skills.\"You got to keep rehearsing. You got to keep training. You got to keep learning. You're never done with learning,\" he said. \"If I look back 30 years of what development looked like back then and what it looks like now, I would have been very behind if I hadn't constantly read blogposts, literature, and tried out things myself.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, believes AI \"democratizes\" access to software development.GitHubGitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke believes coding should be taught as a core subject in schools.In a recent podcast interview, he said AI \"democratizes\" access to software development.Current developers should every tool available to keep sharpening their skills, the CEO added.You should still learn to code, says GitHub's CEO.

        "description": "In case you didn’t know, the risk of your security 2FA getting bypassed is more now than ever. This might be why experts are sounding the alarm that you might be under attack. Despite the great operating system in use, the apps that appear trustworthy might not be as reliable as once perceived. Threat actors are on the rise, and they’re after your data and your accounts. Obviously, the higher the profile of the accounts, the greater the value they hold. This might be a good reason why we’re seeing a host of security warnings pop up every single day. Most of them have to do with leaks on platforms like X, attacks against Apple ID, and advice from the FBI about keeping your Android or iPhone safe from others.Hackers do love all apps and platforms, but experts claim it's Gmail and Microsoft that most cannot get enough and that puts them at the top of the target list. We’re hearing how there’s a serious threat to how actors can bypass the two-factor authentication security checks easily that both these platforms currently use. This is why we have you covered with what you need to do before it’s too late.The Tycoon 2FA isn’t something new. It was first spotted in 2024 after being revealed in 2023 by security researchers. It was in March of 2024 when we saw criminal developers behind that really turn this threat up a level or two by rolling out updates that targeted Microsoft 365 and other accounts belonging to Gmail. They employed the most advanced forms of obfuscation and capabilities to counter detection.The threat now is nearly 11-fold, and new evidence shared more techniques for evasion that are on a different level of sophistication. As per the newest reports from authors, there are anti-debugging scripts, invisible unicodes, and customized CAPTCHA rendered through HTML5 canvas. These are preventing detection. We agree that none of these methods could be groundbreaking, putting them together rolls out a new threat that makes detection and replies more difficult. We’re talking delayed detection, anti-debugging schemes, and more that make this malicious activity go unnoticed. The best way to stay safe is by monitoring, comprehensive inspections for JavaScript patterns, and also browser sandboxing activities. This really puts users one step forward from attackers employing Tycoon 2FA attacks.Both Google and Microsoft have their own fair share of advice to remain safe. This includes using passkeys as they limit phishing and attacks carried out through social engineering. They’re so much stronger against bots, phishing attempts, and targeting SMS attacks. Microsoft shared how it feels that customers should practice great computing habits online. They need to be more cautious of what’s going on when clicking links and opening strange files. They should switch to passkeys when they can and even consider using tools like Microsoft Authenticator that detect threats or phishing attempts.

        "description": "Microsoft's decision to pace data center growth indicates a shift from AI training to inference, aligning with the industry's embrace of efficiency. Former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates, left, and Steve Ballmer, center, pose for photos with CEO Satya Nadella. The company is taking its foot off the AI accelerator.Stephen Brashear/Getty ImagesMicrosoft recently said it may \"strategically pace\" its data center plans.The change follows a shift in its OpenAI partnership and concern about potential oversupply.Microsoft's pivot reflects a broader industry shift from AI training to more cost-effective inference.In the high-stakes race to dominate AI infrastructure, a tech giant has subtly shifted gears.Since ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022, there's been a mad dash to build as many AI data centers as possible. Big Tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on land, construction, and computing gear to support new generative AI workloads.Microsoft has been at the forefront of this, mostly through its partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.For two years, there's been almost zero doubt in the tech industry about this AI expansion. It's been all very UP and to the right.Until recently, that is.Pacing plansLast Tuesday, Noelle Walsh, head of Microsoft Cloud Operations, said the company \"may strategically pace our plans.\"This is pretty shocking news for an AI industry that's been constantly kicking and screaming for more cloud capacity and more Nvidia GPUs. So it's worth reading closely what Walsh wrote about how things have changed:\"In recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\" she wrote in a post on LinkedIn.\"By nature, any significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects,\" Walsh added.Microsoft has backed off a bit latelyShe didn't share more details, but TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias has found several recent examples of what he said was Microsoft backing off.The tech giant has walked away from more than 2 gigawatts of AI cloud capacity in both the US and Europe in the last six months that was in the process of being leased, he said. In the past month or so, Microsoft has also deferred and canceled existing data center leases in the US and Europe, Elias wrote in a recent note to investors.This pullback on new capacity leasing was largely driven by Microsoft's decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads, Elias said. A recent change to this crucial partnership allows OpenAI to work with other cloud providers beyond Microsoft.\"However, we continue to believe the lease cancellations and deferrals of capacity point to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast,\" Elias added.This is worrying because trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom continuing at a rapid pace. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving. (I asked a Microsoft spokesperson all about this twice, and didn't get a response.)An AI recalibration, not a retreatThe reality is more nuanced than a simple pullback, though. What we're witnessing is a recalibration — not a retreat.Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow put the situation in context. The initial wave of this industry spending spree focused a lot on securing land and buildings to house all the chips and other computing gear needed to create and run AI models and services.As part of this AI \"land grab,\" it's common for large cloud companies to sign and negotiate leases that they end up walking away from later, Lenschow explained.Now that Microsoft feels more comfortable with the amount of land it has on hand, the company is likely shifting some spending to the later stages that focus more on buying the GPUs and other computing gear that go inside these new data centers.\"In other words, over the past few quarters, Microsoft has 'overspent' on land and buildings, but is now going back to a more normal cadence,\" Lenschow wrote in a recent note to investors.Microsoft still plans $80 billion in capital expenditures during its 2025 fiscal year and has guided for year-over-year growth in the next fiscal year. So, the company probably isn't backing away from AI much, but rather becoming more strategic about where and how it invests.From AI training to inferencePart of the shift appears to be from AI training to inference. Pre-training is how new models are created, and this requires loads of closely connected GPUs, along with state-of-the-art networking. Expensive stuff! Inference is how existing models are run to support services such as AI agents and Copilots. Inference is less technically demanding but is expected to be the larger market.With inference outpacing training, the focus is shifting toward scalable, cost-effective infrastructure that maximizes return on investment.For instance, at a recent AI conference in New York, the discussion was focused more on efficiency rather than attaining AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a costly endeavor to make machines work better than humans.AI startup Cohere noted that its new Command A model only needs two GPUs to run. That's a heck of a lot less than most models have required in recent years.Microsoft's AI chief weighs inMustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, echoed this in a recent podcast. While he acknowledged a slight slowdown in returns from massive pre-training runs, he emphasized that the company's compute consumption is still \"unbelievable\" — it's just shifting to different stages of the AI pipeline.Suleyman also clarified that some of the canceled leases and projects were never finalized contracts, but rather exploratory discussions — part of standard operating procedure in hyperscale cloud planning.This strategic pivot comes as OpenAI, Microsoft's close partner, has begun sourcing capacity from other cloud providers, and is even hinting at developing its own data centers. Microsoft, however, maintains a right of first refusal on new OpenAI capacity, signaling continued deep integration between the two companies.What does this all mean?First, don't mistake agility for weakness. Microsoft is likely adjusting to changing market dynamics, not scaling back ambition. Second, the hyperscaler space remains incredibly competitive.According to Elias, when Microsoft walked away from capacity in overseas markets, Google stepped in to snap up the supply. Meanwhile, Meta backfilled the capacity that Microsoft left on the table in the US.\"Both of these hyperscalers are in the midst of a material year-over-year ramp in data center demand,\" Elias wrote, referring to Google and Meta.So, Microsoft's pivot may be more a sign of maturity, than retreat. As AI adoption enters its next phase, the winners won't necessarily be those who spend the most — but those who spend the smartest.Read the original article on Business Insider",

It’s also equally astounding that we have been fighting Windows bugs and frozen screens for decades — and yell “Come on!” when it decides to do long software updates just before an important business presentation. Microsoft is now one of the most valuable companies […] The post Microsoft’s Greatest Hits and Epic Fails: A 50-Year Wild Ride appeared first on PYMNTS.com. It’s hard to believe Microsoft hit the big 5-0 this month. It’s also equally astounding that we have been fighting Windows bugs and frozen screens for decades — and yell “Come on!” when it decides to do long software updates just before an important business presentation. Microsoft is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, but there was a time when things were touch and go. Even Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, wasn’t sure if they’d make it. “I was always running scared,” Gates said in an interview with Geekwire. However, by the late 1990s, “we were so successful that even I could say, ‘Ok, we might even make a few mistakes and not disappear.” Then the internet arrived, promising a new era of disruption for a mature Microsoft — along with an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. government seeking to break the company up due to its Windows operating system dominance. “We had this schizophrenic thing — ‘Are we so obsolete that nobody should care about us? Or are we so dominant we have to be split into pieces? I mean, which one is it? Just tell me!’” said Gates, throwing his hands up. Read more: Microsoft to Invest $80 Billion in AI-Focused Data Centers Amid ‘Golden Opportunity’ ‘Developers, Developers, Developers!’ Gates, the company’s first CEO, would step down in 2000 to make way for Steve Ballmer, a former Harvard classmate. As CEO, Ballmer made some smart moves, diving into enterprise software and launching the Xbox gaming console and Microsoft’s Azure cloud business. All are big money makers. But he also had some doozies: acquiring Nokia to boost a failing phone business and launching Bing. Ballmer also famously laughed at the iPhone. “$500, fully subsidized with a (phone) plan? That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard,” he said in 2007, the year the iPhone launched. Ballmer brought his trademark energy to work: He’s known for running on stage at Microsoft’s conferences screaming, “developers, developers, developers!” In 2014, Satya Nadella, an Azure executive, took over from Ballmer as CEO. He got rid of the failed phone business — Windows Phone and Nokia — changed the culture to be more collaborative and is doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI). Today, Microsoft has a market cap of $2.84 trillion (as of midday on April 9) as the second most valuable company in the world, after Apple. Without further ado, here are Microsoft’s greatest hits and epic fails as the company celebrates half a century of existence. See also: Senators Press Microsoft and Google Over AI Cloud Alliances Amid Antitrust Concerns The Magnificent 5 1. Windows 95 — the launch heard around the world (literally a six-second chiming sound) Microsoft paid the Rolling Stones a reported $3 million to use their song, “Start Me Up,” in the marketing campaign to launch Windows 95. People camped outside stores to get their copy. It was the first Windows with a “start” button and task bar. But it also arguably gave birth to a generation of IT guys who are still telling employees with computer problems: “Did you try turning it off and on?” 2. Microsoft Office — the productivity machine that runs the world Love it or hate it, Office has been the backbone of productivity since floppy disks were actually floppy. PowerPoint single-handedly created an entire genre of corporate torture in countless business meetings. Word has processed more college essays, resumes and passive-aggressive office memos than all other software combined. Excel’s ability to calculate complex formulas saved accounting departments from nervous breakdowns. There’s even a Microsoft Excel Championship — no, it’s not a marketing gimmick by the company. It’s an esport played by hundreds of Excel fans, created by a financial analyst from Latvia (not making this up). 3. Xbox — from zero to Halo hero While Sony PlayStation and Nintendo were duking it out, Microsoft crash-landed into the gaming world with a giant black box and literally changed the game. Xbox Live basically invented online console gaming as we know it. Xbox is the exclusive home of one of the biggest gaming hits ever: Halo. It has reportedly made as much as $10 billion for Microsoft. Not bad, Ballmer. 4. Azure — the money printing machine While AWS got the early lead, Microsoft came back swinging. Azure is now the cloud platform your CEO pretends to understand and your IT department depends on. Azure transformed Microsoft from a has-been software company into a cloud computing juggernaut. Nadella essentially turned “boring enterprise solutions” into the buzziest part of Microsoft’s business solutions — like making accounting the most popular major at college. 5. OpenAI investment — bull’s eye on AI Microsoft first invested in this tiny startup called OpenAI in 2019, with $1 billion. That’s a lot of money to give a startup. But three years later, it looked like a savvy bet when ChatGPT took the world by the proverbial storm. AI became a household word. Microsoft would invest a total of more than $13 billion in OpenAI and enjoy exclusive access to its pre-AGI foundation AI models as competitors scrambled to match them. It’s Microsoft’s shrewdest move since coming up with CTRL+ALT+Delete. Read more: Microsoft’s Q2 AI Business Soars but Cloud, Guidance Disappoint The ‘What Were They Thinking’ Flops 1. Cippy — the annoying sidekick “It looks like you’re writing a letter. Would you like help?” NO, CLIPPY, WE WOULD NOT. Microsoft’s early, bumbling version of a digital assistant in the form of an overeager animated paperclip invaded our documents with the persistence of a telemarketer. Clippy was so disliked that Microsoft killed him off in 2001 — the only office supply that was both famous and infamous. One headline: “The Tragic Life of Clippy, the World’s Most Hated Virtual Assistant.” 2. Zune: The iPod killer that became a meme Remember Zune? No? Exactly. Microsoft’s answer to the iPod arrived with a resounding thud. It wasn’t actually bad, but Zune landed at exactly the wrong time, launched in 2006 just as everyone was switching to smartphones. Now, it’s a meme. Yet there still exists an enclave of Zune diehards — on Reddit. 3. Windows Vista: The OS that made everyone miss Windows XP Among Microsoft’s Windows releases, Windows Vista is often considered the most reviled operating system version for business and home users — verified by an online vote. (Windows Millennium Edition was actually more hated, but it’s meant only for home users.) “After the great success of Windows XP, Windows Vista was a fiasco,” according to a Howtogeek.com blog post. It not only came in six “confusing” editions — Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise and Ultimate — but “ran sluggishly” on PCs and was a “memory hog.” Who could forget the “dreaded” User Account Control prompts that would “pop up every few minutes to cover the screen” when using the computer? Thankfully, Windows 7 fixed Vista’s problems, according to the blog post. 4. Nokia acquisition — the $7.2 billion dumpster fire In 2013, Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone division for $7.2 billion as it tried to revive its own handset ambitions. At the time, it had the Windows Phone mobile operating system and its Lumia line of Microsoft phones. But by then, mobile was a two-horse race between Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Nadella ended Microsoft’s foray into mobile phones in 2017, which he later told Business Insider as something he regrets. 5. Bing — is an explanation even needed? As Zune was Microsoft’s answer to the iPod, Bing was its rebuttal to Google Search. The results were similar: Microsoft fell flat. Google has an 89.7% global market share compared to Bing’s 4%, according to Statcounter. Let Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, express how consumers feel about Bing. During a deposition in the U.S. government’s antitrust lawsuit against Google, Cue was asked about the decision to choose Google Search over Bing to power iPhones and other iOS devices. Cue said they wanted a revenue-sharing arrangement and Google had the best search engine while Bing was “inferior.” Google would bring more money to Apple over time. But even if Microsoft matched Google, Apple would never switch. “I don’t believe there’s a price in the world that Microsoft could offer us,” Cue said.

Security and privacy advocates are girding themselves for another uphill battle against Recall, the AI tool rolling out in Windows 11 that will screenshot, index, and store everything a user does every three seconds. When Recall was first introduced in May 2024, security practitioners roundly castigated it for creating a gold mine for malicious insiders, criminals, or nation-state spies if they managed to gain even brief administrative access to a Windows device. Privacy advocates warned that Recall was ripe for abuse in intimate partner violence settings. They also noted that there was nothing stopping Recall from preserving sensitive disappearing content sent through privacy-protecting messengers such as Signal. Enshittification at a new scale Following months of backlash, Microsoft later suspended Recall. On Thursday, the company said it was reintroducing Recall. It currently is available only to insiders with access to the Windows 11 Build 26100.3902 preview version. Over time, the feature will be rolled out more broadly.

        "description": "Google will knock 71% off government Workspace subscriptions for a limited time. Google has long been on the lookout for ways to break Microsoft's stranglehold on US government office software, and the current drive to cut costs may be it. Google and the federal government have announced an agreement that makes Google Workspace available to all agencies at a significant discount, trimming 71 percent from the service's subscription price tag. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the government has engaged in a campaign of unbridled staffing reductions and program cancellations, all with the aim of reducing federal spending. It would appear Google recognized this opportunity, negotiating with the General Services Administration (GSA) to offer Workspace at a lower price. Google claims the deal could yield up to $2 billion in savings. Google has previously offered discounts for federal agencies interested in migrating to Workspace, but it saw little success displacing Microsoft. The Windows maker has enjoyed decades as an entrenched tech giant, leading the 365 productivity tools to proliferate throughout the government. While Google has gotten some agencies on board, Microsoft has traditionally won the lion's share of contracts, including the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solutions contract that pushed Microsoft 365 to all corners of the Pentagon beginning in 2020.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Don’t let Canva’s rainbow gradients fool you. The Aussies are relentless, and their global conquest through easy-to-use design software continues as they set their sights on markets owned by Adobe and Microsoft. Even after a controversial price increase last year, growth is still explosive. Canva has added 50 million active users over the past 12 months, bringing its total to 230 million, with $3 billion in annual revenue.But despite this success, Canva decided it was time for a redesign. And it’s launching what the company considers its biggest overhaul since the app launched in 2012. It includes a Teams-crushing approach to file collaboration, a powerful AI-fueled spreadsheet reminiscent of Notion, and the ability to spin up about any project with an AI prompt—including code.[Image: Canva]The file-juggling redesignAt the core of the updates, Canva has reimagined the project interface of its entire Visual Suite. Whereas you used to pick what you wanted to do on a single track—like make a website or design a T-shirt—Canva has been using AI automation to blur the bounds between projects, turning a document into a slide deck, for some time.[Image: Canva]Now, the interface supports this behavior by default. Your canvas sits center screen, and just below it, Canva has added a bar that contains any and all permutations of what else your project can be. So you can be working on a document above, but have thumbnails with decks, social media posts, and other variations below. You just hit a little “plus” sign and determine what sort of template you’d like to add on next, and AI can take the first steps to translate what you already have to this new type of media. All of these media projects can be edited with your colleagues in real time. But conceptually speaking, this UI is also a real time file management system. Instead of digging through a Microsoft Teams directory to find your social media plan for the Q4 strategy doc, those items just sit side by side, editable and interdependent, on the front end. Print, digital, physical brand assets can all live in the same spot, and a brief, pitch, and budget can live side-by-side.As cofounder Melanie Perkins explains, the interface unifies, not just “creation and consumption” but also “context and communication.” “Something our enterprise clients were really excited about was the idea that you’d often have different specialties working in different places and in different tools,” she says. But now, “your team can literally get on the same page.”[Image: Canva]Canva SheetsNo doubt, Canva is developing a lot of these tools for marketers and social media managers. But while the company has made a lot of progress on unifying brand assets, it has only supported simple tables for data management.Canva Sheets is their full blown response to Excel, loaded with AI capabilities reminiscent of Notion. Everything can be programmed in plain language.[Image: Canva]You can type “list restaurants in Milwaukee and their addresses and use an emoji to signify the type of food they sell,” and propagate an organized spreadsheet with all of this information. You can also import data sets of your own (HubSpot, Statista, Snowflake, and Google Analytics at launch—with custom API integration coming down the line), then visualize them. Canva teases how its data visualization can parse insights on ad spend and ROI, even though it doesn’t formally integrate with ad platforms at this time.[Image: Canva]The other thing Sheets is used for is batch content creation, which is a big part of the appeal to AI for marketers. You can take all of your pieces of media on a spreadsheet, each housed in their own cell, and translate them to another language with a button press.But more than any of these examples, spreadsheets will let Canva dig into more complex computational and organizational tasks. “This is going to be a really foundational piece moving forward for our future ambitions,” says Perkins.[Image: Canva]Canva CodeThen on the most experimental arm of Canva’s updates, it’s introducing Canva Code. While most LLMs will attempt to produce code for you these days, Canva has already tightly integrated such capabilities into the rest of the Canva Suite.Starting from a prompt box on top of Canva’s site, you can already type in whatever you’d like to create, like, “poster for Malibu B&B” to automatically generate a first draft. But with Canva Code, you can now type in interactive features—like “build me a math quiz to practice multiplication with lots of dinosaurs” or “make me a map of flights from Chicago to Tokyo.” Canva will start coding these visions in a process that can take a minute or two. [Image: Canva]When attempting to make my map, I asked for a generic “flight tracker to Tokyo,” and the system generated a somewhat abstract ribbon for the map, with arcs flying into the city. (I could have been more specific.) Then below that, the Canva generated interactive tables listing flight times complete with sortable buttons. It listed if the airports were operational, and listed percentages of flights that were running on time. Assuming you like this, a big button labeled “use in a design” will take this code and put into your Canva projects. With a few more taps, you can publish it to the web.The integration is impressive. Without trying it myself, it’s hard to know the limits of the system’s actual coding ability. But Canva is trying to set expectations at a reasonable level with its own prompting in the UI—mortgage calculators, quizzes, and other simple concepts work well, I’m told.“It’s not going to build the entirety of the Canva application, for example, but we think it’ll get better and better over time as well,” says Perkins, in what she frames as a longer term strategy to the company. “It’s really bringing that interactivity, connectivity, and that dynamic content . . . Until today, [Canva] was ending at quite static content, and now all of a sudden, people can bring [in] very rich interactive experiences.”The updates demonstrate that Canva is still not slowing down on its trajectory, and it’s expanding its capabilities to ensure users can make just about anything within its interface. Or as Perkins puts it, “the company is picking off” the features it believes will offer “the biggest unlock for our community” year after year. The challenges now are just how well Canva can actually execute these features, and whether or not they can truly protect operational simplicity with so many disparate tools.",

        "description": "BufferApp analyzed different social networks like Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Threads, and X to find out which apps are getting the highest engagement rates and where the engagement rates are declining. Engagement rate is a key metric to find out how much people interact with content. If a post has reached 10,000 people but it has gotten fewer likes, it means that the engagement rate is low, but the engagement rate will be considered high if the post gets hundreds of interactions. According to the calculations by Buffer, LinkedIn has the highest engagement rate, with an average engagement rate of 6.50%. It was followed by a 5.07% engagement rate on Facebook which is steady and a 4.86% engagement rate on TikTok. YouTube’s engagement rate was 4.41%, especially in short-form videos. The lowest engagement rate calculated was on Instagram with a 1.16% engagement rate, but there is also a chance of hidden engagement through private interactions on the app. Engagement rates on those apps from January 2024 to January 2025 were also analyzed, which shows how engagement trends have changed over time. It was found that LinkedIn’s engagement rate was steadily rising over this period to reach 6.50% average which is the highest. In January 2024, the median engagement rate of LinkedIn was 6.00% which reached 8.01% in January 2025. There were some factors like less content saturation, conversations getting rewarded by algorithm, and diverse content formats which contributed towards the overall growth of engagement rates on LinkedIn.The analysis also found that even though Instagram has the lowest median interaction rate right now at 1.16%, it declined slowly over the past year. In January 2024, Instagram’s engagement rate was 2.94% which declined to 0.61% in January 2025. It doesn't mean that Instagram is disappearing, it just means that it is moving behind the scenes. More content consumption, private engagement, and reel performance are some factors that are bringing a shift in user behavior which is then contributing to the decline in Instagram engagement.Meta's Threads had the highest engagement rate when it was initially launched, but its engagement rate declined from 4.76% in February 2024 to 3.60% in February 2025. Even though it is still doing better than X, its engagement rate has leveled out because of increased competition and algorithm changes. The early adopter effect is also fading but it is still a high-engagement platform because of its interactive content and real-time engagement.TikTok has surpassed YouTube in engagement rate and now has an engagement rate of 4.86%. Its median engagement rate was 5.14% in January 2024 which decreased to 4.56% in January 2025. Longer videos on TikTok are performing better and creators are making content that keeps users hooked. There is also a competition of short-form videos with YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels being there so TikTok is no longer the only major player. Users have also complained about the content being more polished and predictable on TikTok because of the increase in the presence of brands. YouTube Shorts are quickly catching up with TikTok, with a median engagement rate of 4.41%. Its median engagement rate increased from 3.95% in January 2024 to 4.71% in January 2025. YouTube Shorts is doing well because its content is more discoverable than TikTok, there is higher audience intent and there are more ad revenue opportunities for creators.In January 2024, Pinterest’s median engagement was 3.08% which increased to 5.26% in January 2025 which shows that it has potential for long-term engagement. Pinterest is a search-driven platform which means that users actively seek out content there and pins get longer engagement, unlike engagement on other platforms which fade quickly. Most users are also using Pinterest as a search engine for ideas and inspiration. Facebook’s engagement rate is as steady as ever at 5.45% over the past year mostly because of Facebook groups, demographic engagement, and new monetization tools. X has recently seen a drop in its engagement, from 3.47% in January 2024 to 2.15% in January 2025, which makes it the second-lowest platform in terms of engagement after Instagram. There have been major algorithm changes on X which are prioritizing subscribers and recommended content instead of organic reach and there's a lot of lurking behavior seen on the platform with users passively consuming the content without liking or commenting. Many creators have left the platform as well because of its instability and frequent policy changes. So, if you are making a strategy for your content and need a platform that can get you the highest engagement, make sure to pick one that aligns with your goals. Each platform has a different content requirements so adapt your strategy in a way that goes well with all platforms if you are posting on multiple apps. LinkedIn and Facebook prefer quality over quantity, while platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts want frequency as well. Consistently engaging in real-time conversations on platforms like Threads and X will help you build a community and get high engagements.

It's unclear how many jobs will be cut, but one of the people said it was a significant portion of their team. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment. In the tech industry, there's already a culling of middle managers underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that Google cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.Inside Microsoft, the discussions focus on decreasing the \"PM ratio\" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss, brought this concept from Amazon, where he was a cloud pioneer. There, it's called the \"Builder Ratio,\" and tracks the ratio of software engineers to \"non-builders,\" such as program managers and project managers.Microsoft is considering increasing these targets in some organizations. For example, Bell's security organization right now is around 5.5 engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach 10:1, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans.One of the people familiar with the matter said this ratio is basically a proxy for how many people code. Under discussion are not only cuts that would require managers to meet a certain budget, but to meet a specific team-based ratio, too, the person explained.Earlier this year, Microsoft ousted about 2,000 employees it deemed low-performers.The potential cuts coming in a month or so could also include lower performers. At least some Microsoft leaders are considering terminating those who received an \"Impact 80\" or lower score in performance reviews for two consecutive years, one of the people said.Microsoft evaluates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 called the \"ManageRewards slider.\" Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses.The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. \"Impact 80\" gives employees 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus.Have a tip?

        "description": "Carmack: \"Power tools\" like AI are \"central to all the progress in computers.\" On Monday, John Carmack, co-creator of id Software's Quake franchise, defended Microsoft's recent AI-generated Quake II demo against criticism from a fan about the technology's impact on industry jobs, calling it \"impressive research work.\" Last Friday, Microsoft released a new playable tech demo of a generative AI game engine called WHAMM (World and Human Action MaskGIT Model) that generates each simulated frame of Quake II in real time using an AI world model instead of traditional game engine techniques. However, Microsoft is up front about the limitations: \"We do not intend for this to fully replicate the actual experience of playing the original Quake II game,\" the researchers wrote on the project's announcement page. Carmack's comments came after an X user with the handle \"Quake Dad\" called the new demo \"disgusting\" and claimed it \"spits on the work of every developer everywhere.\" The critic expressed concern that such technology would eliminate jobs in an industry already facing layoffs, writing: \"A fully generative game cuts out the number of jobs necessary for such a project which in turn makes it harder for devs to get jobs.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Redesigned Start menu would give users more control over what apps they see. Windows 11 has become so synonymous with Microsoft's push into generative AI that it's easy to forget that it originally launched as a mostly cosmetic overhaul of Windows 10. But Microsoft continues to work on fundamental elements of the operating system's design. Case in point, Windows tester phantomofearth enabled an overhauled version of the Start menu from a recent Windows 11 beta build, the menu's first substantial rethink since Windows 11 launched a little over three years ago (via The Verge). The new, larger Start menu displays up to two rows of eight pinned apps—you can't see more than two rows by default, but you can expand this section to show more apps—and then shows the scrollable list of apps installed on your PC. This list is hidden behind an \"All\" button on the current Start menu. These apps can be displayed as a vertically scrollable list, in a horizontal grid, or sorted by category (which does appear to be the most space-efficient display option). A redesigned Windows 11 Start menu available in current beta builds. Note that the Recommended section can be hidden and that the rows of pinned apps are wider. Credit: User phantomofearth on Bluesky Viewing all your installed apps by category rather than alphabetically appears to be your most space-efficient option. Credit: User phantomofearth on Bluesky Perhaps most interestingly for people who are tired of Windows' constant reminders and recommendations, the new Start menu looks like it lets you turn that \"Recommended\" section off entirely, replacing it with a full list of all apps installed on your PC. I find the Recommended area inoffensive when it sticks to showing me recently installed apps or opened files, but recent Windows 11 builds have also used it to advertise apps from the Microsoft Store.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "From AI resources to upskilling growth programs, LinkedIn’s annual Top Companies list reveals top employers are investing in making the workplace a place to grow and succeed. “These are companies that make a commitment to their employees and their employees know that they’re not alone in their career,” said Andrew Seaman, editor at large for Jobs & Career Development at LinkedIn News. “I think you can use the methodology in your own job search too.” Published on Tuesday, the list uses LinkedIn data on upskilling, attrition and retention, gender diversity, ability to advance, and more to rank the top 50 U.S. companies for career growth. The list not only honors the companies, but serves as a tool for members looking for jobs. Each honoree will receive a badge on its company page. And according to LinkedIn, all of those top companies are hiring right now, with more than 129,000 job openings across the companies. Landing at the top of the list, Google’s parent company Alphabet takes the number one spot, followed by Amazon and Wells Fargo, which ranked last year as well. AI companies also took the spotlight, with NVIDIA and ServiceNow landing on the list for the first time. Among the 50 honorees, which span across various industries, employers are using AI-powered resources for employees, like Bank of America’s (no. 11) AI virtual assistant Erica; Moderna’s (no. 43) AI academy which customizes learning for employees’ needs; and AT&T’s (no. 7) conversational productivity assistant “Ask AT&T.” AI upskilling initiatives further advances this year’s top skill on the rise, equipping employees with AI literacy. Beyond AI, many top companies shared growth programs for employees like cross-practice rotations. Some of the companies include Walmart (no. 10), which invested $1 billion in week-long training and certificate degrees, creating a pathway for in-demand jobs; and Kearny (no. 46), which offers rotational programs and six-month individualized coaching programs. LinkedIn’s methodology is based on eight pillars: ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, external opportunity, company affinity, gender diversity, educational background, and employee presence in the country. “It can feel really lonely navigating your career, and it’s nice to see companies that invest in their employees and have a vested interest in seeing them succeed,” Seaman said. Here are the top ten companies for 2025 in order: Alphabet Amazon Wells Fargo Northrop Grumman PwC Capital One AT&T JPMorgan Chase EY Walmart",

FreeDOS creator and maintainer Jim Hall goes into more detail about the FreeDOS 1.4 changes here, and full release notes for the changes are here. The release has \"a focus on stability\" and includes an updated installer, new versions of common tools like fdisk, and format and the edlin text editor.

Jefferies analysts cut Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time by 17%.MetaJefferies analysts said that tariffs could allow companies to reset their financial guidance.Tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainties impact tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google.Global stock markets suffered significant losses last week due to the new tariffs.Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies.In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a \"free hall pass\" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures.\"Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance,\" said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill.The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days.The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health.Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days.The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets.Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider.For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, \"likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks,\" the analysts wrote.Roiling marketsThe Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties.Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10.The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week.On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning.\"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,\" Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. \"The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Microsoft is proving to the tech world that it’s not taking a back seat as the AI race heats up. The company just celebrated its 50th anniversary, and that meant a lot of things to look forward to. This includes big plans to host different features that bring it in line with ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. The popular AI assistant will now show support for offerings like customization, deep research, memory, podcast, and camera analysis.Other than that, the latest Memory variant can keep track of different preferences, the user’s personal details like birthdays, interests, and even advice on how to make it all the more proactive. As per Microsoft, it can even select which data it wants Copilot to recall or opt out as a whole.The matter is a huge part of the current efforts to transform the assistant into something more personal. As per the software giant, it’s still in the early process of thinking and evaluating. But once that phase is over, it does hope to give a more personalized touch and entail options such as the return of Clippy.Copilot is more than a simple AI. Every individual gets the chance to uniquely style and blend different attributes that suit every individual separately. So it’s not really just limited to making the AI chatbot more personal to your likes, but also giving it more power. There’s a new Actions feature that provides AI the chance to roll out tasks through web browsers, similar to how the Operator agent works. We’ve similarly seen Amazon’s newest Nova Act model do the same. Microsoft shared how that might be used for show ticket bookings, reservations at restaurants, and purchasing products. When you combine this with shopping features, you’ll see Copilot products appear and now can find more sales and discounts.Copilot Vision first started with the launch of a unique web tool that we found in the year 2004. It’s now undergone a serious expansion to reach Windows and mobile platforms. Through this, the Copilot can see what’s visible on screens across various other platforms and files. In this manner, you can answer queries or interact with content and material at the same time. iOS and Android say that it could discuss anything visible from a phone camera or images seen on camera rolls. Deep Research shared how Copilot could analyze big documents or sources from the internet for giant projects. The research abilities are getting combined with Bing to power AI replies inside a search engine.Related: AI Adoption Enters New Phase Driven by Infrastructure Overhauls and Embedded FeaturesSimilar to how other AI offerings work today, this new Copilot could also use studies to produce podcast-themed audio to look for different topics. Meanwhile, the latest Pages feature will allow it to plan notes and research for various documents into a single file. The software giant says that most of the latest features are launching today in ‘initial files’ and will get even better with time. So we’ll keep an eye on this in the next few weeks and months. The availability varies by feature, the market, and even the app. None of these would be a first, as we’ve seen ChatGPT include memory features in the past year. Then Google Gemini rolled out a vision mode, and now every tech giant wants to make its own personalized AI agent. Remember, ChatGPT first included memory features in the past year, and then we saw Google Gemini roll out vision modes. After that, every AI firm wished to design more personalized AI agents, but included them altogether. This proves how Microsoft is keen on keeping up with other archrivals in the industry. This is also proof that it wants to get the best returns from its investments done inside OpenAI.Read next: Study Reveals ChatGPT’s Cognitive Shortcuts and Biases, Questioning AI’s Trustworthiness in Critical Decisions",

        "description": "Bill Gates said Microsoft had to \"build teams in a more mixed, diverse set of skills than I expected.\" John Nacion/Getty ImagesBill Gates cofounded Microsoft 50 years ago and in hindsight, he'd do some things differently.He said in a recent podcast that he \"turned out to be wrong\" about some elements of building teams.He also said he was \"pretty naive\" when it came to politics.Happy birthday to Microsoft.The tech behemoth turns 50 this month. While it has revolutionized personal computing and become one of the world's biggest companies today, there are some things one of its leaders might've done differently if he could turn back time.Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates recently talked about the advice he'd give his younger self on a podcast featuring the three CEOs who've led Microsoft in the company's 50-year history: himself, his successor Steve Ballmer, and now Satya Nadella.\"Well, there was a lot of learning about how to grow the company and bring in different skill sets, how to manage people,\" he said. \"I certainly at first thought that engineering skill meant you would be good at other things. That turned out to be wrong. So we had to really build teams in a more mixed, diverse set of skills than I expected.\"Gates also said he'd have advised his younger self to be more politically savvy.\"You know, I might tell my younger self, watch out for the government,\" he said. \"I might have a little bit of a tussle with them. I didn't anticipate that. I was pretty naive about not engaging in Washington, DC, as soon as I should have.\"Microsoft was the subject of a massive antitrust case in the 1990s brought by the US Department of Justice and several states, which alleged Microsoft was becoming a monopoly.In 2000, a judge found that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws, and Microsoft was ordered to split into two companies. An appeals court later tossed the judge's order, and the Justice Department gave up its effort to split up Microsoft. The DOJ and Microsoft settled in 2001.Gates has mulled advice to his younger self before. He periodically does \"Ask Me Anything\" sessions on Reddit, and in 2017, one user asked him, \"If you could give 19-year-old Bill Gates some advice, what would it be?\"Gates answered: \"I would explain that smartness is not single-dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then, but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that — maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Bill Gates is reflecting on 50 years of Microsoft.Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesBill Gates is taking a look back at the code that started it all.The Microsoft cofounder this week published the code that became the first product of the company.Take a look at Microsoft's origins as the company turns 50 this month.Microsoft is turning 50 this year, and Bill Gates is looking back at how the company got its start.The Microsoft cofounder published a blog post on Wednesday about the code that would become the company's first product, which was the Altair Basic, an interpreter that translated code into instructions that the Altair 8800 microcomputer could read.\"That code remains the coolest code I've ever written to this day,\" Gates wrote. \"It's amazing to think about how this one piece of code led to a half-century of innovation from Microsoft. Before there was Office or Windows 95 or Xbox or AI, there was the original source code — and I still get a kick out of seeing it, even all these years later.\"At the end of his post, he included a PDF of the original source code for the Altair Basic — all 157 pages of it. You can check it out here.In his blog post, Gates noted that late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen finished part of the code on a flight to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Microsoft was originally based. Gates shared other details on the source code, fittingly, in his memoir \"Source Code,\" which came out in February.Gates reflected on his childhood through his career into today in the book. He wrote that he was disinterested in school growing up, noting that his preschool teachers called him \"rebellious\" and said he showed a \"complete lack of concern for any phase of school life.\"Gates also wrote about his approach, decades later, to recruiting Steve Ballmer to Microsoft, saying he and Allen had agreed to a split of 64% and 36%, respectively, but Gates ended up giving a 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school for Microsoft.Gates' ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, has her own memoir, \"The Next Day,\" out later this month.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "A story about an obsolete PC, an old library book, and a one version of MS-DOS. On this day in 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded a company called Micro-Soft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The two men had worked together before, as members of the Lakeside Programming group in the early 70s and as cofounders of a road traffic analysis company called Traf-O-Data. But Micro-Soft, later renamed to drop the hyphen and relocated to its current headquarters in Redmond, Washington, would be the company that would transform personal computing over the next five decades. I'm not here to do a history of Microsoft, because Wikipedia already exists and because the company has already put together a gauzy 50th-anniversary retrospective site with some retro-themed wallpapers. But the anniversary did make me try to remember which Microsoft product I consciously used for the first time, the one that made me aware of the company and the work it was doing.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "In March, we saw Google share the arrival of a new AI mode that was reserved for Search. Now, we can confirm that Microsoft has entered the race with its own Copilot Search on Bing. The latest rollout does exactly what Google’s AI Mode promises. We saw it first popping up during the latter part of February, where Microsoft shared another dedicated UI for rolling out searches that gave instant replies in a more focused manner through AI. While the classic blue links might not be there, there is a new AI summary of queries or search, and a whole list of resources from the internet that’s seen below it. The software giant shared how it was testing out the feature nearly a month back, but now chose to release it widely and also on Bing’s UI.The news comes to us thanks to eagle eye viewers on X, who say the company is showing Copilot Search as the initial search filter across Bing. That’s more ahead of any dedicated shortcuts for the entire Copilot experience. As mentioned by Microsoft, it’s hoping to experiment and roll out generative search through mega efforts.The change does not seem to be popping up too widely for all users right now. But through our account, we do see it showing up as a new shortcut, hidden across the ‘more’ overflow category.It’s obvious how tech giant Microsoft is really pushing on this entire experience, right at the same time as Google gears up to launch the AI Mode. The feature was officially shared in the early part of last month and right now is in beta with a group of users. However, it’s not determined when there would be a widespread release. All free users who signed up for this and were added to the waitlist are now using it since last week. So we’ll definitely keep an eye out for the mega release for all, so stay tuned!

        "description": "Rebecca Zisser/BIA few months ago, I began noticing an unusual pattern across my digital feeds. Wherever I scrolled, people kept telling me to play Tetris.Aspiring thought leaders on LinkedIn touted the game as a tool for honing strategic thinking. On TikTok, it was promoted as a salve for workday anxiety. Reddit users sang its praises, saying it may help prevent flashbacks from traumatizing experiences, such as witnessing a stabbing at Grand Central Terminal or watching a surfer swallowed up by a deadly swell. In the past six months alone, dozens of Reddit posts have suggested Tetris to help with PTSD, accumulating thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments.I was skeptical. But I quickly realized that I was late to the party. Studies on the game's potential to improve players' mental health and cognition date back to at least the early 2000s. Research on how the brain adapts to playing Tetris goes back even further. In recent years, amid the rise of social media and the modern cult of self-optimization, Tetris has gained new momentum as a better-living gambit. The game has shown up in enough personal development content that its self-help status has graduated from the ultrafringe to the almost mainstream. Somehow, while I was busy living my life, Tetris had become a life hack for business bros, wellness gurus, and plenty of others in between.But how exactly does it work?Tetris was created in 1984 as an arcade game in Soviet Moscow by the scientist Alexey Pajitnov. The concept was simple: Players pieced together descending multicolored puzzle blocks to form tidy rows that fell away to clear space for even more blocks, which tumbled from above at an ever-increasing speed — a hypnotic, quick-thinking race against a game-ending pileup. Players couldn't get enough. Within a few years, the video game creator Henk Rogers partnered with Pajitnov and secured a deal to bring Tetris to Nintendo's then new Game Boy devices, cementing the game as an international obsession and a staple of '90s childhoods.It wasn't long before Tetris devotees began reporting a strange occurrence. The game's cascading blocks would follow them off their screens and show up against the walls of darkened rooms, when they closed their eyes to fall asleep, and even in their dreams. A 1991 study of Tetris players' brain scans found that their cognitive processing while playing the game became more energy-efficient the more they played, suggesting that as they grew their Tetris-playing skills, their brains became ever more primed toward solving the puzzle. Players were able to engage with the game so deeply that they stayed in the zone even after they'd finished playing, the study found, and without virtual Tetris blocks to maneuver, their brains conjured up imaginary ones. In 1994, Wired dubbed this the \"Tetris effect.\"Multiple studies went on to find that playing Tetris within a critical time window following a traumatic event might reduce the onset, intensity, and frequency of PTSD symptoms. A study published last year found that among 164 Swedish healthcare workers who faced work-related trauma during the pandemic, playing a single 20-minute round of Tetris immediately after focusing on the visual aspect of a traumatic memory led to an average 85.9% drop in intrusive memories five weeks after playing. Tetris players continued showing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at about half the rate of nonplayers in follow-ups three and six months later.Amy Morin, a psychotherapist and mental health podcaster in the Florida Keys, says that the research on Tetris and PTSD aligns with a broader shift in the clinical understanding of how memory consolidation and trauma work together. Earlier in her career, Morin recalls, she was expected to coax patients \"to process and debrief\" in the aftermath of possibly trauma-inducing experiences, such as an act of violence in the workplace. Instead of helping people move past the event, this approach often made them feel worse, she says. She and her professional peers now recognize that diving headfirst into processing terrible moments right after the fact can exacerbate distress and give way to rumination, which is a known risk factor for developing PTSD. Its fast-paced decision-making gets me into a flow state that carries over to solving complex programming problems. Playing Tetris, on the other hand, has been found to have the opposite effect. \"Tetris takes just enough brainpower that you have to be much more present and can't be worried about the future or rehashing something in the past,\" Morin says. \"Your brain's kind of like a file cabinet, trying to decide which folder to put these memories into. And something about the way that Tetris works makes it so those things don't end up in the 'let's revisit this later' file.\" In other words, whether through neurocognitive trickery or the sheer force of distraction, playing Tetris may safeguard against locking in the kinds of memories that might become intrusive thoughts down the line. Morin is so enthusiastic about the therapeutic possibilities of Tetris that she recently devoted an entire episode of her podcast to the subject.Other studies point to further applications for Tetris' magic. Richard Haier, the psychologist who first uncovered the mechanism behind the Tetris effect, found that the cerebral cortices of frequent Tetris players became thicker over time, which could lead to improvements in associated functions such as memory capacity and cognitive development. Another study, published in 2018, found that playing Tetris may help counteract anxiety by inducing a state of flow, or being able to focus deeply on a task. Further research has indicated that these brain changes aren't unique to Tetris, with gamers reporting Tetris effect-like hallucinations from other video games. Repetition and puzzle-solving alter your perception, whether you're fitting together a cascade of colorful blocks or mining for materials to slay the \"Minecraft\" dragon. But it's the simplicity and accessibility of Tetris that keep new generations of players discovering — and rediscovering — its hypnotic capabilities.Will Padilla, a 28-year-old content creator and software-as-a-service sales rep in Scottsdale, Arizona, hadn't heard about any of this research when he discovered that playing Tetris helps him push through the trickiest parts of his workday. It was a happy fluke when Padilla decided, on a whim, to queue up the game to keep himself preoccupied one day during the first nerve-racking round of cold calls on the job.\"Cold calls make me really nervous — and everyone who has to make them — because you're calling someone out of the blue,\" Padilla tells me. \"The person could be really rude to you. But it's part of the job.\" Padilla tried other means of distraction to ease the process, such as squeezing a stress ball, to no avail. With Tetris, he realized he'd found his ideal solution. \"It helped me get over the initial 30 seconds of nerves,\" Padilla says. He went on to share the tip on TikTok with fellow SaaS sellers.Padilla's explanation for why the game helped aligns with the research. \"You're doing this stimulating thing that's not causing more anxiety but is making you think in a very calm and analytical way,\" he says.Abhishek Shankar, the founder of a fertility-planning tech startup in Delaware, plays Tetris to clear his mind and sharpen his focus so he can code. \"Its fast-paced decision-making gets me into a flow state that carries over to solving complex programming problems,\" Shankar, 39, tells me. He's even programmed a version of the game for personal use. Who hasn't played Tetris or some other, similar game? You're not out on anything by giving it a shot. Katherine Yan, a 27-year-old engineering manager at Medium who's based in Los Angeles, similarly says that Tetris helps train her brain to quickly recognize patterns and make decisions under pressure. \"It's a constant exercise in prioritization, spatial reasoning, and adapting to imperfect conditions — just like managing competing deadlines and priorities or untangling a legacy codebase.\" Yan, who began playing the game in high school, says she noticed over the years that after playing for even just a few minutes she would return to her work with more focus and faster decision-making capabilities.Jamie Krenn, an adjunct associate professor of human development at Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University's Teachers College, has students play Tetris in her classes every semester to demonstrate how some games can improve problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and working memory by forcing players to think fast and adapt on the fly. \"The way Tetris makes you recognize patterns and plan ahead is basically a workout for your brain,\" Krenn says.At least some of the surge in awareness over the science of playing Tetris comes down to simple SEO. In 2018, Rogers and a team of Japanese video game developers unveiled a spinoff of the game called \"Tetris Effect\" — a sly homage to the cognitive phenomenon. Google searches for the term predictably soared when the game came out, a process that repeated with subsequent releases for new gaming consoles over the next five years. It's all but certain that many of the gamers looking for news on the game stumbled upon the research behind the title.But with growing interest comes expanded misunderstanding. Content creators and even journalists don't always have the scientific background to correctly interpret researchers' studies, which can lead to exaggerated or oversimplified claims, confusion, and backlash. \"'Play Tetris' is the new 'Have you tried yoga?' for PTSD and I'm not having any of it,\" a frustrated Reddit user wrote a couple of years ago in a support channel for complex post-traumatic stress disorder.It's a problem that spreads far beyond Tetris. \"Once an idea that's overly simplistic takes root, it's really hard to challenge that, even if the broader res",

        "description": "It can be said without a doubt that ChatGPT is the world’s most famous chatbot platform. However, it’s not the only one making it big in the AI industry. Yes, new stats prove how Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Co-Pilot are serving serious competition to OpenAI in terms of website traffic, bot usage, and popularity. On average, Gemini saw a 10.9M average daily visit growth, which is up 7.4% MoM. Meanwhile, daily visits for Microsoft Copilot hit 2.4M, which is 2.1% up from stats seen last month.Reports from Similarweb shared how Anthropic’s Claude hit 3.3M average visits each day this month while DeepSeek saw 16.5M visits during the same month. On the other hand, Musk’s xAI’s Grok hit 16.5M visits, which is the same as Chinese startup DeepSeek.The figures fall pale when you compare them to the likes of ChatGPT, which rose above 500M weekly active users at the end of last month. The editor for Similarweb shared how there is fierce competition arising for the second position, after ChatGPT, of course.For the month of March, DeepSeek is the runner-up, but that’s despite the fact that it saw its own traffic fall 25% from that witnessed in February, depending on daily visits. After that, DeepSeek from China came from nowhere. Whatever the case might be, we have to give props to Elon Musk’s Grok, which managed to really pick up the pace in terms of growth. The traffic figures have grown immensely by 800% MoM.A lot of the growth stems from the fact that AI model launches continue to expand with bigger and better model releases. The user bases keep getting bigger. As per stats seen from Sensor Tower, Claude witnessed a 21% growth WoW for weekly active users during that week. This is when we also saw the rollout of Claude’s latest 3.7 Sonnet model. Two weeks before that, we saw Google make a bang with its Gemini 2.0 Flash variant. This caused the figures for weekly active users to grow by 42%.Sensor Tower experts feel the rising tide is not only for newer releases but also has to do with advanced capabilities. This past month, we saw Google bring its canvas feature for Gemini. This gives the chance to preview output linked to coding projects. And then Anthropic continued to add more tools to the Claude clients. The launch of famous AI models rises, and so does the consumer interest and demand in this domain. There are so many unique cases and better user growth for different AI chatbot platforms.OpenAI is not panicking right now. It’s got its own stats to worry about that are doing great at this moment in time. Mobile app usage for ChatGPT has grown 10 times when compared to the likes of Gemini and Claude for the last month. So again, it’s a huge milestone for the AI giant. Image: DIW-AigenRead next: OpenAI Anticipates Delays in New Image Generation Tool for ChatGPT Due to Capacity Challenges",

Jensen Huang said Nvidia could have 100 million of them.Product managers need to be \"domain experts\" in AI agents, said the chief technology officer of Microsoft.Kevin Scott said on an episode of the Twenty Minute VC podcast published Monday that product managers play a crucial role in setting up \"feedback loops\" to make AI agents better.AI agents — AI that can act and make decisions independently — are a hot topic in tech and the workforce. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in January that \"the age of agentic AI is here\" and said last year that Nvidia's 50,000-person staff could work with 100 million agents. OpenAI's Sam Altman predicted that AI agents could start entering the workforce this year.AI agents are intended to be digital coworkers or assistants to human workers in fields ranging from healthcare and supply chain management to cybersecurity and customer service.But for now, AI agents lack something fundamental, Scott said.\"They are conspicuously missing memory, which makes them awfully transactional,\" Scott said. Even the agents that do have memory, he added, have a very limited form of it.Scott said he hopes AI agents can remember user interactions over time, allowing them to \"conform\" themselves more to users' preferences.This kind of memory would give agents \"abstraction and compositionality,\" making them feel less like simple chatbots and more like intelligent digital coworkers, he added.Eventually, he said, the goal is for AI agents to handle increasingly complex tasks — just like a real colleague would.Product managers' roleIn the tech world, product managers have been referred to — both affectionately and critically — as \"mini-CEOs\" of the products they oversee.They act as a bridge between engineers, sales teams, customer service, and other departments, ensuring that products align with user needs.But the role has become a polarizing one, Business Insider's Amanda Hoover reported in November. Some tech workers argue that product managers add little value.According to ZipRecruiter, the average product manager in the US makes about $160,000. Software engineers, meanwhile, average about $147,000, and tech marketing specialists average about $87,000.Microsoft wants to increase the number of engineers relative to product or program managers, BI's Ashley Stewart reported last month. Other companies like Airbnb and Snap are rethinking the need for product managers.The call for executives to go \"founder mode\" — a concept coined by the Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham and touted by Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky — has some leaders questioning whether they should delegate product decisions to product managers.In 2023, Chesky merged product management with marketing, and Snap told The Information in the same year that it laid off 20 product managers to help speed up the company's decision-making.Others believe product managers' influence will only grow in the age of AI.\"The future really does belong to product managers,\" Frank Fusco, a product manager turned CEO of a software company called Silicon Society, told BI in November.As AI becomes more capable of handling coding and other engineering tasks, Fusco said it's an opportunity for product managers to take on an even greater role.With investors and executives eager to capitalize on AI and consumers still skeptical, the demand for product managers will only rise as they help bridge the gap, he added.Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, said product managers play a crucial role in setting up \"feedback loops\" that make AI agents better at their tasks.JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty ImagesProduct managers will work closely with AI agents, said Microsoft's chief technology officer.AI agents — AI that acts independently, including as digital coworkers — are a hot topic in tech.Tech's top execs are psyched about AI agents.

        "description": "Have you ever wanted to sign up for an online service but you didn’t want to provide your real email address as part of the process? There’s a good chance your email address has your actual name in it. Or perhaps you want to avoid the risk of getting spammed. What if you’d rather just sign up privately and have a quick “no more emails please” button? That’s precisely where a reliable email forwarding service can save the day. It empowers you to create a special disguised email address and then use it when signing up with a new app, services, or website. You’ll still get any emails sent to the anonymous email address in your normal email inbox—but the service you sign up with won’t ever see your real address, and you can turn off the incoming emails whenever you like. Most such services require a payment, and they aren’t all trustworthy. But I’ve got a great exception to recommend. Unearth all sorts of fantastic tech treasures with my free Cool Tools newsletter from The Intelligence. A useful new discovery in your inbox every Wednesday! Protect your privacy with anonymous email addresses The best email-masking service for casual, everyday purposes is ​SimpleLogin​. It’s owned by Proton—a reputable company with a history of trust around the privacy-focused ProtonMail and ProtonVPN services. ➜ With a free SimpleLogin account, you can create up to 10 disguised email aliases for free. You can then use them wherever you want online to shield your real email address. ⌚ You can get started in about 30 seconds: Go to ​​the SimpleLogin website​​ and sign up for an account. Just provide your real email address (here, at least, lest you be unable to receive any of your fake-address forwarding messages)—then choose a password and click a link sent to your real email account to confirm. Click “Random Alias” on the SimpleLogin dashboard to create your first new random email alias. (There are other options, too—and a nice little tutorial.) Provide that email alias to any website while creating an account instead of your actual, real address. ~simplelogin.pngSimpleLogin makes it easy to create and copy privacy-minded masked addresses.~ That’s it! You can manage email addresses on the SimpleLogin site—for example, you can click a switch and stop receiving new emails sent to the alias. It’s very helpful for avoiding spam. SimpleLogin is available ​on the web​ as well as through ​an Android app​ and iPhone app​, if you’d rather. The service is free for up to 10 aliases. For ​$36 per year​, you can get unlimited aliases and more features, including the premium version of the Proton Pass password manager. SimpleLogin’s ​privacy policy​ looks great. The service says it never keeps your emails, and it does not log your IP address.

        "description": "Did everyone get the Microsoft 365 rate-hike notice? The personal plan is going from $70 a year to $100 a year. According to the email, my financial commitment is getting me “secure cloud storage, advanced security for your data and devices, and cutting-edge AI-powered features,” among other goodies. But the real reason I subscribe? Microsoft Word. We’ve all used it and many of us rely on it. But many people even aren’t using all the bells and whistles that come with Word and the larger Microsoft 365 package. So as Microsoft hits us with a price hike to go along with all the other price hikes consumers have been facing in the past year, now might be the perfect time to explore some excellent—and completely free—alternatives. Google Docs [Photo: Google] You probably already have a Google account, which means you already have access to Google Docs. That’s likely the most frictionless switch from Word. And just because Google Docs is free and easy doesn’t mean its a slouch. It’s cloud-based, has excellent collaboration features, plus real-time editing, voice typing, auto-saving, and seamless integration with other Google services. If you’re looking for collaboration, sharing documents with multiple people, and quick document creation that won’t feel vastly different from Word, this is it. LibreOffice Writer [Photo: LibreOffice] If you prefer a desktop application, need advanced formatting options, and want a powerful, feature-filled Word replacement, check out LibreOffice Writer. It’s part of the LibreOffice suite, an open-source alternative to Microsoft Office, so if you’re also looking to replace the desktop versions of Excel, PowerPoint, and the like, you’re covered. Though LibreOffice Writer can feel a bit outdated compared to some modern options and there’s an initial learning curve for those used to Word’s interface, this is a tried-and-true alternative for grizzled word-processing pros. WPS Office Writer [Photo: WPS] If you’re looking for a Word-like experience without the price tag and don’t mind occasional ads, give WPS Office Writer a look. It’s got a similar interface to Microsoft Word, good compatibility with Microsoft Word formats, and nice extras such as free templates, cloud saves, and mobile apps. And though it contains ads in the free version, there’s an affordable $36 per year premium subscription that removes ads and throws in some extra features you may or may not use. Give the free version a fair shake first, though: The ads aren’t super intrusive and the feature list is plenty full for what you get.",

        "description": "\"Bypassnro\" is an easy MS Account workaround for Home and Pro Windows editions. Microsoft released a new Windows Insider build of Windows 11 to its experimental Dev Channel today, with a fairly extensive batch of new features and tweaks. But the most important one for enthusiasts and PC administrators is buried halfway down the list: This build removes a command prompt script called bypassnro, which up until now has been a relatively easy and reliable way to circumvent the otherwise mandatory Microsoft Account sign-in requirement on new Windows 11 PCs and fresh installs of Windows 11 on existing PCs. Microsoft's Windows Insider Program lead Amanda Langowski and Principal Product Manager Brandon LeBlanc were clear that this change is considered a feature and not a bug. \"We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11,\" Langowski and LeBlanc write in the post. \"This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Mozilla is giving its Firefox users another reason to celebrate with a new extension for VPN services. This means they can set an IP address for a specific online page. For now, the feature only works for Windows and depends on a third-party vendor, but we could see this expand soon. The news is great, as the current VPN experience is called out as frustrating to say the least. On most occasions, classic VPNs make use of blanket locations for traffic, so it’s cumbersome to switch between different points. So many pages tend to misinterpret the incoming traffic through VPN as suspicious. This makes it accessible to restrictions, a host of time-consuming steps for authentication, and even major slowdowns seen online. Mozilla can solve issues with the latest extension, and that’s what it’s boasting with the new change that comprises two features. The first one is designed for selecting certain pages or websites that don’t need any type of VPN protection. The alternate one is a setting that’s different from VPN locations seen on the site. So in essence, you don’t need to toggle the VPN on and off to reach a certain page. The URL bar will display when a page uses VPN protection, so it’s easier to switch back on when and if necessary. You do get the chance to go through one page like you’re in America, but are actually logging in through Paris. It's all done in a single session. The tech giant shared how it’s bringing a series of new features to different apps soon and hopes to better experience to give a more focused, reliable, and better-performing service. Remember that the company does not run a separate infrastructure for VPNs. The cost each month for a subscription is nearly 10 Euros, while the yearly one costs 60 Euros, which is more expensive than services like Mullvad. For now, the tech giant hasn’t addressed how the solution addresses many different domains that load material for similar websites, such as ads and trackers. It can roll out more risks compared to that seen with Mullvad or different VPN providers when you use wrapper VPNs. Let’s not forget how Mozilla is located in America while Mullvad is present in Sweden. So the former might struggle with surveillance concerns while the latter has stronger guardrails for safety but still faces stringent EU rules.

        "description": "A federal judge has ruled that The New York Times and other newspapers can proceed with a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft seeking to end the practice of using their stories to train artificial intelligence chatbots.U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein of New York on Wednesday dismissed some of the claims made by media organizations but allowed the bulk of the case to continue, possibly to a jury trial.“We appreciate Judge Stein’s careful consideration of these issues,” New York Times attorney Ian Crosby said in a statement. “As the order indicates, all of our copyright claims will continue against Microsoft and Open AI for their widespread theft of millions of The Times‘s works, and we look forward to continuing to pursue them.”The judge’s ruling also pleased Frank Pine, executive editor of MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, owners of some of the newspapers that are part of a consolidated lawsuit in a Manhattan court.“The claims the court has dismissed do not undermine the main thrust of our case, which is that these companies have stolen our work and violated our copyright in a way that fundamentally damages our business,” Pine said a statement.Stein didn’t explain the reasons for his ruling, saying that would come “expeditiously.”OpenAI said in a statement it welcomed “the court’s dismissal of many of these claims and look forward to making it clear that we build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner grounded in fair use, and supportive of innovation.”Microsoft declined to comment.The Times has said OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft have threatened its livelihood by effectively stealing billions of dollars worth of work by its journalists, in some cases spitting out Times‘s material verbatim to people who seek answers from generative artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.—————The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.",

        "description": "Italy just began a new tech battle with American web giants Meta, X, and LinkedIn, where it handed tax demands as part of the VAT claim. The move is major and could give rise to serious consequences across the entire EU region. We already know from previous reports how Facebook and Instagram’s parent firm Meta, with X, was under scrutiny for tax fraud, seeing LinkedIn’s name added to the list is shocking. Many didn’t see the professional networking platform being caught up in the country’s VAT case for Europe that could shake up the tech world. Italy says it needs to claim $961M from Meta, €12.5M from X, and nearly €140M from LinkedIn. The figures are linked for the whole period of scrutiny, which spans from 2015 to 2016 and 2021 to 2022. All of this is dependent on the case, but notices for tax assessment only cover a few years where the claims could expire.The issue is very controversial and sensitive at this moment in time, as there are high tensions due to the trade war between the US and EU after the arrival of the Trump administration. We know that Musk and Italy’s PM have great relations, with plans for Starlink expansion to continue in Italy. The case is major as it determines the manner social networks give access to services. We know more about how authorities in Italy continue to argue about user registrations related to X, Meta, and LinkedIn.Meta failed to share more details on the matter and explained how it tried its best to fully cooperate with authorities in Italy. Meta has been very clear since the start about how no VAT could be collected for providing data to users online. X and LinkedIn also didn’t wish to comment on the case. The case might get extended to the EU, which features 27 different countries, and that means giving rise to a new business model for the tech world. So this approach taken up by Italian authorities could have drastic consequences for many to access free services on different sites. Now only time can tell what the final outcome of the case is as the stakes are high, both in terms of financial and political interests.

        "description": "Bellevue, Washington, is the home of thousands of Microsoft employees. Its AI-powered traffic monitoring system lives up to such expectations. Using existing traffic cameras capable of reading signs and lights, it tracks not just crashes but also near misses. And it suggests solutions to managers, like rethinking a turn lane or moving a stop line.But this AI technology wasn’t born out of Microsoft and its big OpenAI partnership. It was developed by a startup called Archetype AI. You might think of the company as OpenAI for the physical world.[Image: Archetype AI]“A city will report an accident after an accident happens. But what they want to know is, like, where are the accidents that nearly happened—because that they cannot report. And they want to prevent those accidents,” says Ivan Poupyrev, cofounder of Archetype AI. “So predicting the future is one of the biggest use cases we have right now.”Poupyrev and Leonardo Giusti founded Archetype after leaving Google’s ATAP (advanced technology and projects) group, where they worked on cutting-edge projects initiatives like the smart textile Project Jacquard and the gadget radar Project Soli. Poupryev details his history of working at giants like Sony and Disney, where engineers always had to develop one algorithm to understand something like a heartbeat, and another for steps. Each physical thing you wanted to measure, whatever that may be, was always its own discrete system—another mini piece of software to code and support.There’s simply too much happening inside our natural world to measure or consider it all through this one-problem-at-a-time approach. As a result, our highest-tech hardware still understands very little of our real environment, and what is actually happening in it.What Archetype is suggesting instead is an AI that can track and react to the complexity of the physical world. Its “Newton” foundational model is trained on piles of open-sensor data from sources like NASA—which publishes everything from ocean temperatures gathered with microwave scanners to infrared scans of cloud patterns. And much like an LLM can infer linguistic reasoning by studying texts, Newton can infer physics by studying sensor readings. [Image: Archetype AI]The company’s big selling point is that Newton can analyze output from sensors that already exist. Your phone has a dozen or more, and the world may soon have trillions—including accelerometers, electrical and fluid flow sensors, optical sensors, and radar. By reading these measurements, Newton can actually track and identify what’s going on inside environments to a surprising degree. It’s even proven capable of predicting future patterns to foresee actions ranging from the swing of a small pendulum in a lab to a potential accident on a factory floor to the sunspots and tides in nature.In many ways, Archetype is constructing the sort of system truly needed for ambient computing, a vision in which the lines between our real world and computational world blur. But rather than focusing on a grand heady vision, it’s selling Newton as a sort of universal translator that can turn sensor data into actionable insight.“[It’s a] fundamental shift to how we see AI as a society. [Right now] it’s an automation technology where we replace part of our human labor with AI. We delegate to AI to do something,” Giusti says. “We are trying to shift the perspective, and we see AI as an interpretation layer for the physical world. AI is going to help us better understand what’s happening in the world.”Poupyrev adds, “We want AI to act as a superpower that allows us to see things we couldn’t see before and improve our decision-making.” [Image: Archetype AI]How does Archetype AI work? Lenses.In one of Archetype’s demos, a radar notices someone entering the kitchen. A microphone can listen for anything prompted, like washing dishes. It’s a demonstration of two technologies that reside in many smartphones, but through the context of Newton, sensor noise becomes knowledge.In another demo, Newton analyzes a factory floor and generates a heat map of potential safety risks (notably drawn in the path of a forklift coming close to people). In yet another demo, Newton analyzes the work of construction boats, and actually charts out a timeline of their active hours each day. Of course, physics alone can’t extrapolate everything happening in these scenes, which is why Newton also includes training data on human behavior (so it knows if, say, shaking a box might be inferred as “mishandling” it) and uses traditional LLM technology for labeling what’s going on.Each different front-end UX described above required some custom code, and Archetype has been working with its early partners in a white-glove approach. But the core logic at play is all built upon Newton. “Our companies don’t care about some AGI benchmark we can meet and not meet,” Poupyrev says. “What they care about is that this model solved their particular use cases.”Much like entire apps are now built upon OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, Archetype is making Newton AI available as an API (and customers can request access now). Technically, you can run Newton from computers operated by Archetype, on cloud services like AWS or Azure, or even on your own servers if you prefer. Your primary task is simply to feed whatever sensor data your company already uses through a Newton AI “lens.” The lens is the company’s metaphor for how it translates sensor information into insight. Unlike LLMs, which work on question-answer queries that lead us to metaphors like conversations and agents, sensors output streams of information that may need constant analysis. So a lens is a means to scrutinize this data at intervals or in real time. And the operational cost of running Newton AI will be proportionate to the amount and frequency of your own sensor analysis. [Image: Archetype AI]Tuning the lens is surprisingly simple: You can use natural language prompts to ask the system something like “alert me every time there’s a safety issue on this floor” or “notify me if an alarm goes off.” But what’s particularly exciting to the company is that in analyzing sensor waveforms, Newton AI has proven that it doesn’t just understand a lot of what’s happening, but it can actually predict what may happen in the future. Much like autocomplete already knows what you might type next, Newton can look at waveforms of data (like electrical or audio information from a machine) to predict the next trend. In a factory, this might allow it to spot the imminent failure of a machine.To demonstrate this idea, Archetype shares data from an accelerometer measuring the swing of an elastic pendulum (aka a pendulum on a spring—which is a classic way to generate chaotic behavior). Even though the model has never been trained specifically on pendulum equations or been programmed to understand accelerometers, Archetype claims that it can accurately track the swing of the chaotic pendulum and predict its next movements. Poupyrev says the same is true for thermoelectric behaviors, like we might see in electronics.By observing patterns normally ignored, and coupling that information with predictive analysis, Archetype believes it can revolutionize all sorts of platforms, ranging from industrial applications to urban planning. And for its next act, the company wants Newton to output in more than text; there’s no reason why it can’t communicate in symbols or real-time graphs.The claims are, on one hand, outrageously large and tricky to grok. But on the other, Poupyrev has built his entire career on building mind-bendingly novel innovations from existing technologies—that actually work.For any company interested in Newton, Archetype is still working closely with partners to use their API. Pilots start in the mid-six figures, while annual projects range into the millions, depending on scale.",

Striking a balance between the desire for founder control and board oversight is essential; otherwise, why have a board at all?' Avey said. \"It's a familiar trope in Silicon Valley that wealth translates into unquestionable business savvy. But no matter how great an idea, the importance of the dynamics of the founding team and their ability to listen to feedback is key.\"Avey, Wojcicki, and representatives for 23andMe did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.23andMe struggled before filing for bankruptcy23andMe has weathered several storms since 2023.Although privacy concerns have bogged down the company for years, criticism spiked that October over news that some user data had been compromised. Hackers claiming access to the data, including birth details and names, were selling it on the dark web. 23andMe told BI the ancestry data for almost 7 million users were accessed. Following a class action lawsuit, the company agreed to a $30 million settlement last September.That same month, the independent directors of 23andMe's board resigned in a letter addressed to Wojcicki, saying it's \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"23andMe announced three new independent board members in October 2024 and added another member this month.Wojcicki landed in the hot seat in 2024 when an SEC filing said she \"would be open to considering third-party takeover proposals.\" After consumers expressed concerns over what could happen to their personal data, Wojcicki reversed course.The cracks at 23andMe deepened last November when the company announced it was restructuring its business, laying off roughly 40% of its staff, and ending further development of its therapeutics program.Most recently, 23andMe said it will continue to operate while seeking a buyer.\"After a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximize the value of the business,\" chair Mark Jensen said in a press release. \"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities.\"Read the original article on Business Insider 23andMe cofounder Linda Avey discussed the company in a social media post on Wednesday.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images23andMe cofounder Linda Avey discussed the company in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday.Avey said the biotech company \"lost its way\" without product development and \"proper governance.\"23andMe filed for bankruptcy, and CEO Anne Wojcicki resigned this week.23andMe cofounder Linda Avey is mourning what the biotech company could have become.Avey reflected on 23andMe — and criticized former CEO Anne Wojcicki — in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday, saying that \"it was time to express my views on the company, after witnessing the downfall of an idea and brand that could have become the world's leading digital health platform.\"On Sunday, 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced Wojcicki's resignation.

We can only imagine the importance of the dataset that could have been built, combining blood work, deeper gene sequencing, wearable data, and providing actionable insights,\" Avey said. \"Now, the market is fragmented with data siloed in many different companies.\"Avey said 23andMe \"lost its way\" without \"consumer-focused product development\" and \"proper governance.\"\"The 14+ million people who bought into the concept deserve to see their data moved to a secure platform with new leadership and vision,\" Avey said.Avey rounded out her statement by emphasizing the importance of a balanced C-Suite.\"There are many cautionary tales buried in the 23andMe story. Striking a balance between the desire for founder control and board oversight is essential; otherwise, why have a board at all?' Avey said. \"It's a familiar trope in Silicon Valley that wealth translates into unquestionable business savvy. But no matter how great an idea, the importance of the dynamics of the founding team and their ability to listen to feedback is key.\"Avey, Wojcicki, and representatives for 23andMe did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.23andMe struggled before filing for bankruptcy23andMe has weathered several storms since 2023.Although privacy concerns have bogged down the company for years, criticism spiked that October over news that some user data had been compromised. Hackers claiming access to the data, including birth details and names, were selling it on the dark web. 23andMe told BI the ancestry data for almost 7 million users were accessed. Following a class action lawsuit, the company agreed to a $30 million settlement last September.That same month, the independent directors of 23andMe's board resigned in a letter addressed to Wojcicki, saying it's \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"23andMe announced three new independent board members in October 2024 and added another member this month.Wojcicki landed in the hot seat in 2024 when an SEC filing said she \"would be open to considering third-party takeover proposals.\" After consumers expressed concerns over what could happen to their personal data, Wojcicki reversed course.The cracks at 23andMe deepened last November when the company announced it was restructuring its business, laying off roughly 40% of its staff, and ending further develo",

Welsh FinTech Burbank has raised $6 million to bring “tap and PIN” payments online. The company’s funding round, announced Tuesday (March 25) on its LinkedIn page, will help Burbank develop its “Card Present over Internet” (CPoI) tool, which it calls a first-of-its-kind technology aimed at addressing fraud and chargeback issues. The tool lets users make payments by tapping their cards against their phones and entering their PIN number, similar to the way they’d pay in store. “The payments experience should be the same for everyone, regardless of channel,” CEO Justin Pike said in the company’s announcement. “In-store we pay by tap and PIN, which is globally trusted and familiar, and now, for the first time ever, we’re enabling the same process in online channels. Simple, secure, and scalable.” Writing about the issue of chargebacks earlier this month, PYMNTS argued they are a “fact of life” in the commerce world. “Customers dispute transactions, money is kept back from merchants amid the dispute, and the card issuer determines whether the money should be kept by the merchant or returned to the cardholder,” that report said. “But for merchants, and specifically eCommerce firms, the specter of increased chargebacks hits the top and bottom lines and limits visibility into operational cash flow.” In addition, there are also the issues of damaged customer relationships and fees incurred in tandem with chargebacks. An overabundance of chargebacks can cause payment processors to levy fines or penalties. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence focused on Australia said that eCommerce firms in that country want their payment service providers (PSPs) to help mitigate the impact of chargebacks. For middle-market eCommerce businesses — ones whose revenues are $1 billion or less — widespread improvements are being seen with checkout, as a relatively small number of merchants compared to other countries said they face roadblocks in that area. “Limiting chargebacks was a key driver for 44% of merchants, which indicated that there is a real and lasting concern that the appeal of card-not-present transactions (that are easier for consumers) and the volume of those transactions must be balanced against the risks of chargebacks and disputes,” PYMNTS wrote. “Focusing on higher conversions addresses one of the most immediate business goals — ensuring more shoppers finalize their purchases — but it can open the door to chargebacks after the purchase is completed.” The post Burbank Raises $6 Million to Tackle Online Fraud and Chargebacks appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

In the business realm, the word “startup” conjures up the garage as innovation lab, the bootstrapping and scrapping micro-firm that has the potential to disrupt an industry and grow into a behemoth. Apple comes to mind, and so does Microsoft. Social media platforms were once only a twinkle of a college student’s daydream mused upon in a dorm room. For middle-market companies and especially those with $100 million to $1 billion in sales — which means that they are already well-established — the smaller players in their respective industries, particularly within the services verticals, are gaining currency as formidable competitors. As detailed by PYMNTS Intelligence in the “Navigating Uncertainty: How Middle-Market Executives Adapt, Compete and Innovate,” 60 heads of product said that the development and tech-driven businesses they help steer are finding that the competitive landscape is shifting. Among middle-market firms, 42% consider innovation a primary or significant factor in their competitive strategy. But 13% of middle-market product leaders now see startups as their biggest competitive threat, a 2.6x increase from six months ago. Among the reasons that these smaller players are able to pose new challenges: They may be outstripped by their larger brethren in terms of sales, but they also have the key edge of being nimble, and quite often they harness artificial intelligence (AI) to improve their operations and to innovate in new ways. Large corporations remain the most frequently cited rivals for the middle-market companies, though the trend has been declining a bit, as the share of middle-market companies stating that these juggernauts are the biggest competitive threat has declined (in favor of smaller companies) from 33% to 27%. Rival middle-market businesses also saw a slight uptick in being named top competitors, rising from 12% to 15%. Private equity-backed competitors seen as a concern were lower among middle-market companies, inching lower from 10% to 6.7%. Drilling Down Into Service Industries The competitive shift is most keenly felt in service industries like real estate and finance. In those fields, 16% of leaders now view small businesses or startups as their main competitors, up from 11%. There’s awareness among all middle-market firms that innovating — in a bid to joust with the smaller challengers — has the beneficial effect of improving their own fortunes. The data shows that, in particular, heads of product prioritizing tech-driven strategies report 54% fewer instances of high uncertainty. Innovation leads to product differentiation and better perceptions of their brands in their respective marketplaces. In just the past half year, the share of middle-market firms citing technological advancements as a competitive challenge has risen fivefold. Innovation Is Key to Competitive Strategy We found that the firms that make innovation a primary or significant factor in their business development roadmaps are likelier to emphasize industry shifts (36%) and customer demand for more advanced solutions (24%), enabling them to pivot faster and reduce uncertainty. But the road to tech-driven innovations is no straight line. With technological advancements also emerging as a greater challenge — rising from 3.3% to 20% — middle-market firms must balance policy compliance with innovation to avoid falling behind in a complex business landscape.

        "description": "Reid Hoffman was once an intellectually curious student at Stanford. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesIn 'AI Valley,' journalist Gary Rivlin follows Silicon Valley's biggest names and their contributions to AI.One is LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, a legendary investor once called the \"most connected person in Silicon Valley.\"His front-row seat to AI left Hoffman unimpressed; he viewed it as a toddler, he once told Elon Musk. The following is a book excerpt. Reid Hoffman loved his time on campus. He was among the first 10 people at Stanford to pursue a newly minted major called Symbolic Systems, which, just like the field of artificial intelligence, melded computer science with linguistics, psychology, and other disciplines.On campus, computer science majors dismissed Symbolic Systems as \"C.S. lite\" but the intellectually curious Hoffman valued the opportunity to take a wide array of classes across campus. Life was finally as he had fantasized it when he was younger, surrounded by like-minded souls who shared his thirst for learning and desire for late-night debates on vital issues.One of those late-night debate partners was Peter Thiel, who would play a critical role in the development of artificial intelligence. The two made for an unlikely pairing. Where Thiel had been raised in a deeply religious conservative family, Hoffman was a product of the counter-culture sixties.Family lore put Hoffman on his father's shoulders at demonstrations opposing the Vietnam War that sometimes turned tumultuous. \"Apparently, I was running from tear gas even before I could walk,\" Hoffman said. The two met during their sophomore year in a philosophy class called \"Mind, Matter, and Meaning.\"\"I'm pretty sure he saw me as a bleeding-heart pinko commie,\" Hoffman said. \"And I'm absolutely certain I saw him as a libertarian wacko who seemed to have sprung out of Ayn Rand's book, 'The Fountainhead,' fully formed.\"Gary Rivlin released a new book, \"AI Valley: Microsoft, Google, and the Trillion-Dollar Race to Cash In on Artificial Intelligence.\"HarperCollins PublishersThe two argued for well over an hour after their first class together and pretty much continued that debate for several decades, until Thiel gave more than $1 million to Donald Trump's first campaign and they decided, for the sake of their friendship, to avoid politics. As upperclassmen, the two ran for Stanford's student government on a joint ticket. Hoffman was the left-winger, Thiel the right-winger. Both won.The second AI winter hit just as Hoffman arrived on campusBut the kid who had worked his way through shelves of science fiction at the local library was excited for a real-life glimpse at what machines could do. \"I was not alien to the notion of robots and artificial intelligence,\" Hoffman said. He secured a summer internship at the legendary Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), which gave the world the mouse and icon-driven computing, among other cornerstone contributions. There he became so engrossed in the AI-related research project he was assigned that he took a semester off to continue his work.The next summer, he worked on expert systems at IBMAs an upperclassman, Hoffman worked with David Rumelhart, a giant of the AI world who had pioneered \"parallel distributed processing models,\" an approach that accelerated the speed by which a neural net could process information. Rumelhart served as Hoffman's advisor through much of his time at Stanford.Yet his front-row seat on AI left Hoffman unimpressed. As he would tell Musk years later over dinner, he viewed the technology as if it were just a toddler. An AI winter meant less money for research but, even if cash had been flowing, computers were still not powerful enough. \"The networks were so small they wouldn't do anything other than toy problems,\" Hoffman said. A major breakthrough while he was still at Stanford was a computer that could reliably read numbers printed on a check.\"I concluded AI was not going to happen anytime soon,\" Hoffman said. \"So I just went off to do other things.\" An exceptional student, he applied for and won a coveted Marshall Scholarship, which provides free tuition and living expenses for American citizens pursuing a graduate degree at a university in the United Kingdom.In 1990 he moved to England to pursue a doctorate in philosophy at Oxford UniversityThere, at the oldest university in the English-speaking world (Oxford was founded in 1096), he imagined himself \"grappling with the big questions of values and ethics and who we should be as a society,\" he said. Instead, he learned that his teachers were \"hostile to the idea of academics being public intellectuals. The professors there seemed to only want to talk about esoteric theories without any interest in actual people. I very quickly realized that wasn't me.\"Hoffman stuck it out long enough to earn a master's in philosophy from Oxford's Wolfson College. With no savings and no job prospects, he returned to his homestead to figure out what he would do next.Hoffman moved in with his father back in BerkeleyHis father, who had been a crusading lawyer earlier in his life, had settled into a career as a real estate attorney. During Hoffman's second week home, his father asked him: You're going to get a job, right?\"I'm researching my options,\" Hoffman told him. His father's retort: Why don't you research why you need to get a job?Hoffman had taken several computer science courses at Stanford but did not have the background or training he needed to secure a programming job in Silicon Valley. But plugging into the substantial network of friends he had built during his four years in Palo Alto, he learned about a team inside Apple developing a new online service called eWorld. They needed a contractor who could produce design mockups using Adobe's Photoshop.Hoffman had never used PhotoshopBut his contact there handed him a manual and told him to be ready to start the following week. \"Locking myself in a room for a weekend, I became a Photoshop ninja,\" Hoffman said. Soon he was working as a full-time junior product manager, overseeing the design and launch of eWorld's international offerings. Hoffman had imagined himself as a public intellectual who penned essays and books on the day's big issues. Instead he was helping Apple find a way to cash in on the internet.From the book: \"AI Valley: Microsoft, Google, and the Trillion-Dollar Race to Cash In on Artificial Intelligence\" by Gary Rivlin.

        "description": "LinkedIn has revealed top professional skills based on LinkedIn members and job listing data in its new report, which is an expansion of its annual Work Change Report. The report looked at top rising skills in 15 different sectors what the users are adding to their profiles and which ones are listed on LinkedIn ad postings. It is no surprise that AI skills are most needed on the platform because of how technology and businesses are adopting AI. The number one skill that is rising on LinkedIn in 2025 is AI literacy, which is followed by content mitigation and adaptability. Some other top skills include public speaking, customer engagement and support, process optimization, and stakeholder management. The report also mentioned innovative thinking, solution-based selling, LLM development, and application and growth strategy as the top skills on LinkedIn. Budget & Resource management, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and GTM strategy are also among the top 15 skills mentioned by LinkedIn members and job postings. Many LinkedIn users are seen adding “Artificial Intelligence” as a skill after using tools like GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT but this doesn't mean that they truly have technical expertise. To clarify that, LinkedIn has added ‘AI literacy’ as a skill which shows that someone with this skill has familiarity and not expertise in model building or AI development. More advanced AI skills like working with LLMs have also appeared on the list. Even basic AI skills are also becoming highly needed in the job market and many businesses are prioritizing employees with AI-related expertise.

        "description": "At NVIDIA’s developer conference on Thursday, a large group of energy companies—along with a few technology companies—announced plans to collaborate on building AI models and apps aimed at improving the generation and distribution of electric power. The initiative, called the Open Power AI Consortium, is organized by the Palo Alto-based Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Founding members include Nvidia, Microsoft, AWS, and Oracle. Notably absent from the group are all of the leading developers of frontier AI models such as Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI. “This is about getting the right data, and getting it clean, so that it can be used for AI,” Jeremy Renshaw, who leads the consortium at EPRI, tells Fast Company. Renshaw says energy companies have mountains of data, but organizing it in a way that AI models can process is key. But already, over two dozen regional power companies in the U.S. have signed on, including Con Edison, Duke Energy, New York Power Authority, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Westinghouse Electric Company. EPRI President and CEO Arshad Mansoor said in a statement that the consortium will create an AI model, datasets, and apps to “enhance grid reliability, optimize asset performance, and enable more efficient energy management.” It will also foster a collaborative environment where utilities, startups, academics, and national labs can work together to address power sector challenges using AI. The consortium doesn’t include representatives from government agencies, but Renshaw said he’d like to see their inclusion. “We intend to include anyone involved in the making and moving of electricity,” he says. “Government is important because they do the permitting, licensing, and they provide regulations.” The announcement comes amid growing concern in the tech sector over the strain that AI workloads can place on data centers. (Google even pledged last year to buy energy from small modular reactors developed by Kairos Power to support its growing AI ambitions.) Axios climate reporter Alex Freedman notes that the power demands of the so-called AI boom have become a top priority for energy company CEOs in the U.S. Freedman highlights an ongoing debate within that sector over whether the power demands of AI will prolong the use of fossil fuels. Should that prove to be the case, AI could further push back constructive work toward climate goals.",

Skills needed for jobs are rapidly changing, with LinkedIn estimating that 70% job skills will change by 2030. In response, the social network identified the top 15 fastest-growing skills in the United States with its inaugural Skills on the Rise 2025 report. With a quarter of professionals planning on learning new skills, LinkedIn’s list pinpoints the most popular skills for both professionals and companies hiring. LinkedIn identified growth on skills by measuring various metrics and comparing the findings from 2024 and 2023. The metrics included the increase of a skill mentioned in paid job postings, the rate of new skills added to users’ profiles, and skills of users hired within the past year. Successful collaboration is crucial in a tension-filled world Landing second place on the list, conflict mitigation is set to become popular among various industries like higher education, consulting, and tech. By navigating workplace conflicts effectively, conflict mitigators generate successful collaborative environments. Other soft skills on the list include innovative thinking, public speaking, and adaptability, with professionals prioritizing. “You can teach technical skillsets but if you are unable to work well with others, listen effectively, collaborate with others, be respectful, be open to outside thoughts you will struggle,” one LinkedIn user commented on the list. LinkedIn’s report also notably accounts for the proliferation of AI use in the workplace, with AI Literacy landing the top spot on the list, and large language model (LLM) development and application scoring farther down the list. Here are the full 15 skills in order: AI Literacy Conflict Mitigation Adaptability Process Optimization Innovative Thinking Public Speaking Solution-Based Selling Customer Engagement and Support Stakeholder Management LLM Development and Application Budget and Resource Management Go-to-Market Strategy Regulatory Compliance Growth Strategy Risk Assessment",

Even if you don't know its roots as an outgrowth of a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project, Plex is not your typical \"streaming\" service, given how most people use it. So as Plex announces its first price increase to its Plex Pass subscription in more than 10 years, it has its work cut out explaining why, what's included, and what is changing. Starting April 29, the cost of a Plex Pass rises from $5 to $7 monthly, from $40 to $70 annually, and a lifetime pass now costs $250, previously $120. In a blog post, Plex cites rising costs and its commitment to an independent service that supports \"personal media.\" \"We are all in on the continued success of Plex Pass and personal media,\" the post states. \"This price increase will ensure that we can keep investing dedicated resources in developing new features, while supporting and growing your favorites.\" The post cites a roadmap that contains an integration with Common Sense Media, a new \"bespoke server management app\" for managing server users, and \"an open and documented API for server integrations,\" including custom metadata agents.Read full article Comments",

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

The attack, which originally targeted the widely used “tj-actions/changed-files” utility, is now believed to have originated from an earlier breach of the “reviewdog/action-setup@v1” GitHub Action, according to a report. The initial compromise of tj-actions/changed-files, designated as CVE-2025-30066, was discovered last week when researchers found malicious code injected into the tool. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has officially acknowledged the issue, noting that “This supply chain compromise allows for information disclosure of secrets including, but not limited to, valid access keys, GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), npm tokens, and private RSA keys.”",

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel (L) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (R).Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch and David Ramos/Getty ImagesEvan Spiegel is best known as the CEO of Snap.However, he was briefly listed as a VP of product at Meta on LinkedIn — as a gag by an employee.Meta's platforms have copied features from Snap over the years, such as Stories.Evan Spiegel doesn't work at Meta, but if you're looking at his LinkedIn, you might have thought he did.The Snap cofounder and CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday that one of his employees temporarily put on his profile that he was \"VP Product @ Meta\" as a gag. (His LinkedIn profile no longer shows that.)The joke appears to be a dig at Meta, which has taken a few pages from Snapchat's book over the years when it comes to features.For example, Snapchat was the first to introduce user Stories that disappear after a while, rolling out a feature in 2013 that let users post photos and videos that'd vanish after 24 hours.Meta in 2016 unveiled its own Stories feature on Instagram, and Facebook got them the following year. WhatsApp debuted a similar feature called Status also in 2017.Facebook offered to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013, but Spiegel's company declined. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Spiegel in 2016 to try again.Zuckerberg has been asked about the striking similarities between some of the companies' offerings before.In a 2017 earnings call, he talked about what was at the time called Facebook's Camera Effects Platform.\"I think we were a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works,\" he said. \"But I do think at this point we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making an open platform, I think, is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps. And I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.\"Snapchat had previously unveiled animated AR selfie masks and filters.More recently, Snapchat showed off its newest AR glasses, called Spectacles, last year, days before Zuckerberg announced Meta's competing Orion glasses.Meta and Snap did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Read the original article on Business Insider",

How do you stay on your boss's radar in a positive way?Simply put, if your boss already knew what you were up to, they wouldn't need to send an email like that. As the former VP of HR for Microsoft with 40 years of business leadership experience, I've seen a lot of people who know how to stay visible.Being visible helps avoid uncomfortable inquiries like the \"five bullet points\" request and makes performance reviews easier for both you and your boss. It helps you avoid being labeled an underperformer when cuts are considered and it can help you be more top of mind when opportunities arise — it's a great way to \"manage up.\"Here are three ways to help you stay visible to your boss and reduce your chances of being laid off. You should always track your accomplishments at workIt doesn't matter if your boss sends an intrusive status report request like \"send five bullet points from last week\" or a simple \"Hey, what's up?\" inquiry; you should always be ready to talk about what you've been up to.That's why you should track your accomplishments. There are many ways to do this. Some people keep a \"brag book,\" a simple document where they list the significant things they've done. Others use a notes application or even a complex database.For years I kept a simple four-column spreadsheetMy spreadsheet had columns labeled: Date, Item, Significance, and Notes. Every day, or at worst, every week, I'd add a couple of rows to the sheet. I'd insert the date and a phrase for the item — just enough to remind me what it was.In the significance column, I'd put a number to represent how important the item felt at the time, with \"5\" being the highest. In notes, I'd add a comment or even a link to the project or document.Then whenever I wanted, I could sort by significance and date and get the most important things from the last month, week, or year. When bosses requested a progress report, I was always ready to respond: \"I'm glad you asked.\"The best way to ensure this happens is to make it a habit. Spend two minutes updating your list at the end of every day. This also helps at performance review time, where you'll inevitably need to report on your accomplishments for the year.Don't be shy to take credit where dueAnother important way to stay visible is to ensure you take credit when you deserve it. Too many people get shy or humble at work and let others grab the limelight.Work is not a place for excessive humility. The forever humble, the \"I'm just doing my job\" kind of people are often overlooked. They're just doing their jobs, after all. If you want to be seen, you have to be visible. Don't be afraid to take credit for your accomplishments.Ways to make sure you get credit for your workInsist your name appears on that proposal or presentation. Don't be afraid to put your name under the title of that document. Don't be shy about answering \"That was me\" when someone asks about a great idea.Also, don't let others steal your work without objection — even if you lose a battle for representation. For example, when your boss takes the credit, putting them on notice helps for the next time. If you simply let people take credit for your work, they'll never stop.Raise your hand and help outA final way to stay visible is to not shrink into a corner when the boss needs help. When the call comes for volunteers, raise your hand.One of the best ways to stay on your boss's good side is to help them get their job done. The best way to do that is to do things they don't want or have time to do. Just being able to say, \"Don't worry, I'll handle that,\" means a lot.But it's often hard to know what they need help with. You don't do their job, so it's a challenge to understand where you can jump in. When they explicitly ask, that's where you can most certainly be useful.Know when to volunteer and when to sit backYou don't have to raise your hand all the time. You don't have to answer your boss's every whim. You shouldn't stretch yourself beyond your limits just to be in their good graces.But you should also not be the one who never volunteers. Your boss will notice that you never pitch in or lend a hand to your peers. That's how you stay on your boss's radar in the worst possible way.Essentially, if you track your performance, take credit where due, and learn when to help out, you'll never be blindsided by the \"five things you did last week\" request because both you and your boss will already know. These are three great ways to increase visibility at work.Chris Williams is a former VP of HR at Microsoft.

The role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is shifting from summarizing or creating content for single users to co-working and collaboration with multiple agents, according to the chief product officer of Microsoft Experiences and Devices. “In the early phase, we were just adding AI to existing applications,” said Microsoft’s Aparna Chennapragada, referencing tools like Microsoft Copilot, which can summarize meetings, draft emails and help with research. “The second phase is now about co-working and collaborating with AI,” she said. With improvements in deep reasoning capabilities, AI is moving from basic automation to becoming a “thought partner” that can analyze complex problems and assist leaders in making better decisions, she said. However, the “more interesting” change will come in the third phase, which will be AI’s role in group collaboration, Chennapragada added. “So far, everything has been single-player, individuals with AI. The third phase is actually a group of people and a group of agents working,” collaborating and co-existing together, she said. The human employee will interact with an AI agent that acts as a “digital chief of staff,” which in turn will manage a team of other AI agents that each specialize in different tasks or domains, she said during a panel at last week’s HumanX conference in Las Vegas. This shift will create what Chennapragada describes as a “cognitive energy surplus.” Instead of employees wasting time on repetitive, low-value tasks, AI will handle the routine while human workers focus on creativity, strategy and decision-making. In a few weeks, Microsoft is planning to launch an initiative combining deep reasoning capabilities with an enterprise’s knowledge graph as a foundation for custom AI agents, Chennapragada said. Read more: AI Agent Systems Are Here — Will They Transform B2B? AI Normalization at Work The use of AI use is becoming increasingly commonplace and accepted in the workplace, Chennapragada said. Previously, employees often used AI tools without their employers’ explicit approval. A Microsoft study from a year ago found that over 80% of workers were using AI at work, but only around 50% were comfortable telling their managers. That is changing rapidly. “There’s a lot more acknowledgment that this is actually useful for employees,” she said. “In response, CIOs are saying: ‘We want both — we want our employees to be able to use it, but there needs to be guardrails’” in audit, governance, compliance and security, she added. Sharing the stage with Chennapragada, Jerry Dischler, president of cloud applications at Google, said CIOs and CTOs he talked to have said that cost is a factor in not expanding AI usage to more employees. But after Google included more features in its base product, there was a “very large” increase in usage, he said. “They want everybody to use it,” Dischler said. As long as there are guardrails, “they very much see it as part of the strategic capability of their business to get good at AI.” Despite growing enthusiasm for AI, they acknowledged that companies still face barriers to adoption. Chennapragada pointed to three key hurdles: Information overload — “There’s just this gush … of AI tools. What do we even do? Which of these tools do we choose?” Organizations are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of AI solutions available. Defining next steps — Using today’s generative AI tools, “people can ask questions and get answers, but what’s the next click after that?” Companies may struggle to figure out what to do next. User interface needs work — “The chat interface is fine and all, but it’s like an AOL dial-up modem interface to a superintelligence,” she said. The user interface with AI is a blank box. It needs to improve. Dischler added that after a company rolls out AI tools to its employees, “everybody just looks at it and (says), ‘I’m not sure what I do with it.’” That is a problem with the user interface by builders like Google and Microsoft. “We should have user interface patterns that allow people to do their best work with the help of AI every single time.” Both Microsoft and Google executives agreed that AI is on the verge of becoming far more autonomous. “I think we’re going to be surprised by what AI can do with minimal interaction from users over the next 24 months,” Dischler said. Chennapragada took the idea a step further, predicting that the AI-driven workplace transformation would change job roles altogether. “In 12 to 24 months, every employee will be a manager — every worker will be the boss of these AI agents,” she said.

        "description": "Copilot can be reinstalled from the Microsoft Store if it's something you want. Microsoft's Windows updates over the last couple years have mostly been focused on adding generative AI features to the operating system, including multiple versions of the Copilot assistant. Copilot has made it into Windows 11 (and even, to a more limited extent, the aging Windows 10) as a native app, and then a wrapper around a web app, and soon as a native app again. But this month's Windows updates are actually removing the Copilot app from some Windows 11 PCs and unpinning it from the taskbar, according to this Microsoft support document. This bug obviously won't affect systems where Copilot had already been uninstalled, but it has already led to confusion among some Windows users. Microsoft says it is \"working on a resolution to address the issue\" but that users who want to get Copilot back can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and repin it to the taskbar, the same process you use to install Copilot on PCs where it has been removed.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "AI image editing may be all the rage, but good old-fashioned image editors are still essential. There’s a problem, though: Windows PCs, Chromebooks, and Macs don’t include exceptional image editors that go beyond the most basic editing needs. Sure, you can pay for Photoshop or hunt down another image editor—but what if you just want to do something quick? Well, then you’re left searching the web—and maybe you come across a reasonably decent online image editor, but perhaps it forces you to sign into an account or pay for a subscription. Or maybe it just doesn’t do what it promises to do in any especially impressive way. Let’s skip all that. Today’s tool is an easy, free, and completely browser-based image editor that doesn’t need any accounts or payments. You can access it from any type of device, too, and start editing images almost instantly. Psst: If you love these types of tools as much as I do, check out my free Cool Tools newsletter from The Intelligence. You’ll be the first to find all sorts of simple tech treasures! Photoshop for the rest of us Allow me to introduce you to Photopea. ➜ ​Photopea​ is a powerful tool that many of our Cool Tools newsletter readers have recommended over time. ⌚ You can get started with it in roughly 10 seconds. It’s simple: Just head to ​the Photopea website​. (The first time you load it, you’ll want to click the “X” in the top-right corner to hide the welcome banner.) Then choose the “Open From Computer” button and select an image from your device’s storage—or, if you’re on a PC, drag and drop an image from your computer’s file manager directly onto the Photopea page. Photopea makes it easy to import files from your phone or computer. You’ll then see an image-editing interface that’ll look immediately familiar if you’ve ever used Adobe Photoshop. Photopea is packed with professional-grade tools that are normally limited to costly, complex, and at-times clunky desktop image editors. You’ll find layers, filters, a ​clone stamp​ for touch-ups, a background removal system, and even batch resizing and image-converting options. Whenever you’re made the modifications you need, click the “File” menu and select “Save” to download your final file. That’s it. Photopea looks and feels a lot like Photoshop, but it’s completely free and runs entirely in your browser. Now you’ve got a Photoshop-caliber image editor at your fingertips whenever you need it—for free, usable without signing in, and without any software installation required. What’s not to love? You can ​use Photopea on its website​ in your browser. (It’s technically compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers, but the desktop experience tends to be best. If you see a Photopea app in the Android or iOS App Store, know that it isn’t official or associated with this same site.) Photopea is free with ads. You can sign up for an account and pay $5 per month to remove the ads and get access to AI photo-editing tools, if you like, but it absolutely isn’t required. Photopea’s ​privacy policy​ says all your photos are stored on your device and never sent to any remote servers or shared in any way. Keep the geeky goodies coming with my free Cool Tools newsletter. You’ll get an instant introduction to an incredible audio app and a new off-the-beaten-path gem in your inbox every Wednesday!",

Hogan has served in the role since then, helping Nadella craft a new workplace management system around the concept of a \"growth mindset.\"It's the idea is that employees develop skills through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a \"fixed mindset,\" which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure.\"Kathleen and I have been discussing this transition and succession planning for some time, and we both agree this is the critical juncture to apply new focus and intention to this work,\" Nadella wrote in an email to employees announcing the change.Coleman, the incoming chief people officer, is likely to have a big impact on the redesign of Microsoft's performance review process.Read CEO Satya Nadella's email to employees:Subject: Senior Leadership UpdateAs we've seen time and again throughout our 50-year history, times of great change for the world and for our industry require us to have a mindset that enables us to continually adapt and transform ourselves. There's no question that we are at the forefront of another such moment, with the rapid changes across every industry and business function in this AI era.This means we must have the right product portfolio, the right business models, attract and retain top talent, and optimize our processes to meet changing customer expectations and succeed in the marketplace.With this context, I've asked Kathleen Hogan to transition to a new role focused on defining our overarching corporate strategy and structure and leading our continuous transformation as a company. Kathleen will assume a new role as EVP, Office of Strategy and Transformation, reporting to me.It is hard to overstate the impact Kathleen has had on Microsoft as Chief People Officer. Over the past 10+ years, she has led our cultural transformation, as we embraced a growth mindset, positioning us to seize new opportunities with agility and attract and retain world-class talent. She is recognized externally as a consequential HR leader transforming culture and the world of work. Her more than 20-year tenure at Microsoft, including leading our global services business, paired with her prior experience as a McKinsey partner in Silicon Valley, and a development manager at Oracle, makes her uniquely suited to lead this work as we accelerate our pace of change across our people, processes, and portfolio. Kathleen will work across the SLT as we chart this next phase of our transformation, which requires both interpreting the outside and redefining the inside.Kathleen and I have been discussing this transition and succession planning for some time, and we both agree this is the critical juncture to apply new focus and intention to this work.With this transition, I'm very pleased to share that Amy Coleman will assume the role of EVP, Chief People Officer, leading our HR organization. She joins the senior leadership team reporting to me.Amy has led HR for our corporate functions across the company for the past six years, following various HR roles partnering across engineering, sales, marketing, and business development spanning 25 years. In that time, she has been a trusted advisor to both Kathleen and to me as she orchestrated many cross-company workstreams as we evolved our culture, improved our employee engagement model, established our employee relations team, and drove enterprise crisis response for our people. Amy's commitment to operational excellence and high performance will be key in driving our continued success, and I'm confident in the perspective, expertise, and thoughtful approach she'll bring as we navigate the next phase of our journey.Please join me in congratulating Kathleen and Amy on their new roles.SatyaRead the original article on Business Insider Kathleen Hogan, who was chief people officer at Microsoft, will switch to a role in the company's Office of Strategy and Transformation.MicrosoftMicrosoft has replaced its chief people officer as it overhauls performance reviews.Kathleen Hogan is switching to a role in the \"Office of Strategy and Transformation.\"Amy Coleman, a longtime HR executive, will step in as the new chief people officer.Microsoft has replaced its chief people officer as the company rethinks its performance review process.CEO Satya Nadella announced in an email to employees on Wednesday that Kathleen Hogan will leave the chief people officer position and take on a new role as executive vice president of the \"Office of Strategy and Transformation.\" Amy Coleman, already a longtime Microsoft HR executive, will take over for Hogan.\"As we've seen time and again throughout our 50-year history, times of great change for the world and for our industry require us to have a mindset that enables us to continually adapt and transform ourselves,\" Nadella wrote in the email. \"There's no question that we are at the forefront of another such moment, with the rapid changes across every industry and business function in this AI era.\"The change comes after Microsoft fired nearly 2,000 employees deemed low-performers in January and February as it reviews its performance review and management process, several people with knowledge of the plans recently told Business Insider.One of Nadella's first big leadership moves after he took the helm in 2014 was to name Hogan as Microsoft's chief people officer. Hogan has served in the role since then, helping Nadella craft a new workplace management system around the concept of a \"growth mindset.\"It's the idea is that employees develop skills through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a \"fixed mindset,\" which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure.\"Kathleen and I have been discussing this transition and succession planning for some time, and we both agree this is the critical juncture to apply new focus and intention to this work,\" Nadella wrote in an email to employees announcing the change.Coleman, the incoming chief people officer, is likely to have a big impact on the redesign of Microsoft's performance review process.Read CEO Satya Nadella's email to employees:Subject: Senior Leadership UpdateAs we've seen time and again throughout our 50-year history, times of great change for the world and for our industry require us to have a mindset that enables us to continually adapt and transform ourselves. There's no question that we are at the forefront of another such moment, with the rapid changes across every industry and business function in this AI era.This means we must have the right product portfolio, the right business models, attract and retain top talent, and optimize our processes to meet changing customer expectations and succeed in the marketplace.With this context, I've asked Kathleen Hogan to transition to a new role focused on defining our overarching corporate strategy and structure and leading our continuous transformation as a company. Kathleen will assume a new role as EVP, Office of Strategy and Transformation, reporting to me.It is hard to overstate the impact Kathleen has had on Microsoft as Chief People Officer.

Once Ballmer came aboard in 1980, he \"became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,\" Gates wrote.Ballmer was later succeeded by Satya Nadella, who has held the role since taking over in 2014.Gates says his fears were unfounded in hindsight since Ballmer \"took us to new heights\" and Nadella has done well at \"navigating what even today remains one of the most complex CEO jobs in the world.\"The company has notched several important milestones since Gates departed as CEO.Its market cap has grown substantially, hitting a record $3 trillion dollars late last year. The company released the first Xbox in 2001 and has snapped up video game makers Mojang and Activision Blizzard. It also acquired companies like GitHub and LinkedIn. In recent years, it's poured billions into a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\"It makes me feel so good that I get to just come in and play a very bit role of doing product reviews, learning about AI, you know, getting some help from Microsoft on the work that I'm doing,\" Gates added. \"And it's allowed me, you know, to throw everything in and to have the incredible resources that my Microsoft ownership created.\"While Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000, he continued to serve on the company's board of directors until 2020, when he stepped down following allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward female employees.He has spent much of his time since on the philanthropic foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.BI's Ashley Stewart reported last year that Gates remains \"intimately involved in the company's operations\" behind the scenes, reviewing products, advising on strategy, and recruiting top executives.Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told BI at the time that Gates' role as a technical advisor, which he began in 2014, hadn't substantially changed since he vacated his board seat.The \"insistence on portraying the role of Bill Gates as 'pulling strings' at Microsoft,\" Shaw told BI at the time, \"is fundamentally inaccurate and at odds with reality.\"\"With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company,\" Gates wrote in 2020 about the move. \"Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in January 2000.Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for NetflixBill Gates had one big question on his mind when he stepped down as CEO of Microsoft.He said he wondered, \"Was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence?\"Gates was succeeded first by Steve Ballmer and later by Satya Nadella, though he's become more involved amid the AI race.It's not easy handing over the reins of the company you created — just ask Bill Gates.Gates worried about the company's future when he ended his tenure as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, he said in an interview Microsoft posted Thursday.\"I've had two successors, and boy, do I feel lucky because as I went off to do the foundation work, the one thing that plagued me was, was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence, and would I be haunted by should I go back, should I not go back?\" he said.The billionaire Microsoft cofounder was succeeded as CEO by Steve Ballmer, who led the company from 2000 to 2014.Gates wrote in his his memoir, \"Source Code,\" which came out last month, that he gave a 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school and join Microsoft.

        "description": "Google has big plans for gaming in 2025. The annual Game Developers Conference is about to kick off, and even though Stadia is dead and buried, Google has a lot of plans for games. It's expanding tools that help PC developers bring premium games to Android, and games are heading in the other direction, too. The PC-based Play Games platform is expanding to bring every single Android game to Windows. Google doesn't have a firm timeline for all these changes, but 2025 will be an interesting year for the company's gaming efforts. Google released the first beta of Google Play Games on PC back in 2022, allowing you to play Android games on a PC. It has chugged along quietly ever since, mostly because of the anemic and largely uninteresting game catalog. While there are hundreds of thousands of Android games, only a handful were made available in the PC client. That's changing in a big way now that Google is bringing over every Android game from Google Play. Starting today, you'll see thousands of new games in Google Play Games on PC. Developers actually have to opt out if they don't want their games available on Windows machines via Google Play Games. Google says this is possible thanks to improved custom controls, making it easy to map keyboard and gamepad controls onto games that were designed for touchscreens (see below). The usability of these mapped controls will probably vary dramatically from game to game.Read full article Comments",

Last year, Microsoft showed off a pair of concept videos highlighting how \"real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot\" might one day provide personalized guidance and companionship while playing a solo game of Minecraft. Now, Microsoft is announcing that it will roll out \"Copilot for Gaming\" as an \"ultimate gaming sidekick\" that will be available via mobile app preview for Xbox Insiders starting in April. Unfortunately, the current version of Microsoft's gaming \"copilot\" seems to fall well short of last year's demo, providing some bare-bones automation of functions that can mostly be achieved pretty easily today without the aid of AI. The new app feels less like a revolutionary new use case for conversational AI and more like a glorified, Xbox-branded version of Apple's Siri. Wait, is that it? Watching a short, livestreamed demo of the new Copilot for Gaming app, my reactions quickly shifted from \"that's kind of neat\" to \"wait, is that it?\" That process started from the very first moment, when a player asked, \"I want to get back into Age of Empires... Can you install it?\" Conversational installation prompts could be a bit more convenient than simply clicking the handful of buttons needed to start a game install without AI, but it's not the most exciting use case to lead off with.Read full article Comments",

Using a Windows PC with an Arm-based Snapdragon processor in it feels a lot like using a regular-old Intel or AMD PC these days, thanks to the work developers have put in to get their apps running natively on Arm chips and the work Microsoft has done on Windows' Prism technology for translating x86 apps to run on Arm processors. But some of the old compatibility gaps still remain. For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running. Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company announced that it's bringing its Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for Fortnite. Both are coming to Arm PCs \"later this year.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Identifying which companies you hope to work for is one of the biggest hurdles job seekers face. I know this because I was a search consultant for over 25 years. Now, I have an executive résumé and LinkedIn profile writing practice. And my clients almost always ask questions about how to find future employers. I advise them to use AI chatbot platforms like ChatGPT, Claude AI, and Perplexity. To help the platforms work their magic, I encourage them to use NAICS codes in their prompts. Here’s how to do this: What are NAICS codes? NAICS is the acronym for the North American Industry Classification System. It assigns six-digit codes to companies as follows: The first two digits in a NAICS code identify economic sectors (e.g., 23 for Construction). NAICS has 20 sectors. The third and fourth digits divide economic sectors into subsectors. Example: 23 becomes 2382 for Building Equipment Contractors, a type of construction company. NAICS has 99 subsectors. The fifth and sixth digits divide economic subsectors into industries. Example: 2382 becomes 238220 for Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors, a type of building equipment contractor. NAICS has 1,000-plus industries. Thus, you can use NAICS codes at different levels to identify where you want to work. Once you know that, you can ask AI chatbot platforms to find companies in those NAICS codes. How AI chatbots can help find companies I asked ChatGPT how it finds companies. It searches for and analyzes public information from filings, directories, and the internet. It does in a minute or two what would take a job seeker hours, days, or weeks. I ran several searches on different platforms to show you how to use these chatbots to speed up your job search. You can see my prompts and results below. Prompts to find target companies I used these prompts to find companies by industry, location, and size: Prompt 1: Please list all the companies in NAICS code 713210 (Casinos) in Nevada. Claude AI provided a list of 55 large casinos. When I asked it to limit its results to Reno, it gave me 20 casino and gaming establishments. Prompt 2: List the 20 largest companies in the US in NAICS code 221115 (Wind Electric Power Generation). Perplexity listed 20 companies. When asked, it also shared locations, descriptions, and the 21st through 40th-largest companies. Prompt 3: List the companies in NAICS code 441110 (New Car Dealers) in Washington State’s King County. Perplexity named 17 dealerships, which was a good start but not comprehensive. ChatGPT wouldn’t answer my query. Instead, it suggested I use Data Axle Reference Solutions, which I have recommended for years. DARS has a database of almost 100 million U.S. businesses. It’s the ultimate resource if you hit a dead-end finding target employers, and it’s searchable by NAICS codes. Prompts to find recruiting, private equity, and venture capital firms Job seekers also want to find potential sources of opportunities, such as recruiting and private investment firms. To identify these targets, I used the following prompts. They included a subsector, industries, and specific investment strategies: Prompt 1: Please list search firms that recruit executives for companies in NAICS code 3254 (Pharmaceutical & Medicine Manufacturing). ChatGPT provided a list of 25 firms, although I had to re-prompt it with “Any more?” several times. Prompt 2: List venture capital firms that invest in AI start-ups (NAICS code 541745). ChatGPT provided a list of 28 firms. While I had to re-prompt it with “Any more?” several times, I stopped asking before it was done sharing firms. Prompt 3: Please list private equity firms that acquire turnaround clothing retailers (NAICS code 458110). ChatGPT provided a list of 17 firms. Again, I re-prompted it several times. Perplexity, prompted and re-prompted, gave me a list of 18 firms. You can use different platforms and variables at will. Doing so enables you to assemble lists of potential target companies in minutes.",

[…] The post Report: FTC to Continue Biden Administration’s Antitrust Probe of Microsoft appeared first on PYMNTS.com. An antitrust probe of Microsoft that was launched in the last days of the Biden administration will reportedly continue under the Trump administration. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff have continued gathering information for the investigation, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (March 12), citing unnamed sources. Neither the FTC nor Microsoft immediately replied to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, the FTC sent Microsoft a civil investigative demand late last year demanding information about the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) operations, data centers, software licensing practices and decision to cut funding on its own AI projects after making a deal with OpenAI. One company that was asked for information as part of the investigation told Bloomberg that the FTC wants to determine whether Microsoft has an edge over other AI companies because of the profits it earns from other parts of the business, per the report. The FTC’s questions about the company’s software licensing practices may relate to competitors’ complaints about Microsoft bundling its office productivity, security software and cloud offerings, which makes it harder for them to compete, according to the report. Microsoft’s decision to cancel some of its own work on AI after investing in OpenAI and using that company’s software is also under scrutiny by the FTC because that move may have reduced competition in the field, per the report. Wide-ranging antitrust investigations like the one targeting Microsoft can take years and don’t always result in a case brought by the FTC, the report said. Microsoft spokesmen Alex Haurek said in the report: “We are working cooperatively with the agency.” It was reported in November that the FTC was set to investigate allegedly anticompetitive practices at Microsoft’s cloud computing business, focusing on allegations that the tech giant illegally uses the market power of its Office 365 productivity software to benefit its Azure cloud service. In December, it was reported that Microsoft formally requested an investigation into the FTC after reports surfaced that details of the antitrust investigation were leaked. The company asked the regulator’s inspector general to examine whether senior management at the agency disclosed nonpublic information about the probe.

        "description": "It needs to be more than just stock Windows with a coat of paint. The long-running rumors and hints that Microsoft is planning to enter the portable gaming market accelerated forward this week. That's thanks to a Windows Central report that Microsoft is planning to partner with a \"PC gaming OEM\" for \"an Xbox-branded gaming handheld\" to be released later this year. The device, code-named Keenan, will reportedly feature \"Xbox design sensibilities,\" such as the branded Xbox guide button, but will almost certainly be a PC gaming device running Windows at its core. Any Microsoft entry into the world of gaming handhelds will join a market that has become quite crowded in the wake of the Steam Deck's success. To make its own portable gaming effort stand apart, Microsoft will have to bring something unique to the table. Here are some of the features we're hoping will let Microsoft do just that. A bespoke user interface There's never been a better time to bring back the old Xbox 360 \"blades\" interface. Credit: Microsoft / Reddit For decades, Windows has been designed first and foremost for the world of large monitors driven by a mouse and keyboard world. When hardware makers try to simply stick that OS into a handheld screen size controlled by buttons and analog sticks, the results can be awkward at best.Read full article Comments",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.Before becoming Hootsuite's CEO, I lived on social media and consumed my news, information, and trends online — but I was more of a passive consumer than a content creator.When I became CEO in 2023, I leaned more into content creation. I felt the role of CEOs was changing, and I wanted to interact with our customers directly online.It's a scary jump to go from passive consumer to content creator. I've sat across from dozens of executives who are hesitant about social media. Many leave dealing with it up to their 22-year-old intern or social media team, but leaders need to interact directly with customers.Reports suggest customers are more likely to buy something if the CEO has a strong social media presence. Leaders need to show up where their customers are at. We don't have the luxury of deciding whether to post. You're late if you're not doing it.I was scared to put myself out there, but authenticity is important to customersWhen I started posting as a CEO, the first thing that came into my head was fear. I wondered what to say and was cautious about putting myself out there. Though I still feel nervous now, I've also received overwhelming support. People are hungry for real voices.A lot of the CEOs and customers we work with want to talk about their company and product, and that's it. However, from surveys we know people want to see posts from brands and executives that showcase an authentic point of view.This involves putting yourself out there, which can be scary. It's your name, face, and thoughts. You're opening yourself up for debate. Executives want to make sure we're protecting our company and brand, and talking about our own personal thoughts can put that at risk.I started making video content to post on LinkedInI have accounts on multiple social media platforms, but I only post on LinkedIn, where I have over 18,000 followers. It feels like the right professional environment for me to post on. I set aside at least 15 to 30 minutes a day to engage with people online. Over the past year, I've increased my LinkedIn follower count by several thousand.I started ramping up my social media efforts by commenting on other people's posts and following executives and leaders I was interested in. The more time I spent listening to what my customers and peers were saying online, the more ideas I had about things I wanted to say.English is a second language for me, so I find writing more difficult than talking. Though I started with written posts, I found creating videos easier. I could just open up a camera and go, even when walking to a meeting or in the back of a cab.I've shared personal and professional stories to give people a peek behind the curtain of my life and often include lessons I want to pass on to other business leaders. For example, I recently posted about being daunted by networking events and why the discomfort is a great opportunity to grow.The videos aren't live, so I can decide not to post them later. Sometimes, if there's background noise, I'll have someone make some edits, but they're mostly what you see is what you get. The more raw and authentic it is, the better. They tend to drive impressions, bringing awareness to the brand, which can also bring in potential revenue.It's important that leaders have control over what's posted on their accountIn the past, especially early on in my journey, I've asked people to double-check my posts to make sure I wasn't doing anything to put the company at risk. I think it's a healthy thing for leaders to do.I've also asked our social media team if they had ideas about what I should post about or for suggestions about how to improve posts. It's useful to get help from the experts, but at the end of the day, it's my voice, my thoughts, and mostly my language.I'm sure there are people who have ghostwriters who do everything for them without them reviewing it, but the whole point is it needs to be authentic. It's my face recording the videos, so I have to believe what I'm saying.Leaders should use any help they can get, but since it's your voice and your name, having final control over it is really important.I've journeyed with how much of my personality to share onlineWhen I became a CEO for the first time at a previous company, I thought I needed to act and talk in a certain way and that I shouldn't use emojis or exclamation marks.I got tired of having a double persona, and once I leaned into who I actually was, it made my leadership life a lot easier. Now, I embrace emojis and show my authentic self in my videos.One of the biggest vulnerability points was when I shared a picture of me and my parents, celebrating my immigration anniversary. I was thinking about how many years we've been in America and what it's meant for my family.I felt so vulnerable posting it and called my social media team to ask if I'd made a terrible decision. Self-doubt is normal. More leaders should talk about it and embrace it.It's scary to put your thoughts out there, but that's the role of a leader.Read the original article on Business Insider Hootsuite CEO Irina Novoselsky said posting authentic, raw videos has helped her build her LinkedIn presence.Courtesy of HootsuiteHootsuite CEO Irina Novoselsky was a content consumer but never saw herself as a creator.Since becoming a top exec, she had to overcome her fears of posting to build her online presence.Novoselsky said it's important to meet customers where they are and be relatable as a CEO.This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Irina Novoselsky, CEO of the social media management platform Hootsuite.

        "description": "Some physicists are doubting the claims made last month by Microsoft after it shared a breakthrough in quantum computing. The software giant’s claims were outlined as unreliable and the need to be revisited in the future, a leading quantum physicist from St. Andrews University says. Henry Legg shed light on how he and his team made major progress on a two-decade-old quest to produce the first ever topological qubits using Majorana particles.Therefore, he feels the work lacks a constant definition and the results can vary greatly, even for measurements done on a similar device. However, the news didn’t make Microsoft happy. The company's VP for quantum dismissed the claims as a load of hot air, insisting the critics hadn’t even peeked at the published papers. He also says they lack the basic comprehension to try to understand the findings.Microsoft put its findings in Nature, but without peer review, some saw it as skating on thin ice. While the study outlined the approach, it does not speak about progress as per one spokesperson from the software giant.The tech giant mentioned how there is so much progress since when this domain was last studied. However, it lacks to defend its claims as no future publishing was done in the form of a more detailed report.Another critic was seen questioning the news on social media shortly after it was revealed. So this means that the matter they are working on for the past two decades was attained successfully, but they are not going to publish more details on the findings, she added.The head for Amazon’s quantum tech also shared more on this subject. They said that the report in Nature does not really demonstrate anything major or justify the claims Microsoft has made. The matter is a major tech advancement. But it doubted it was a serious breakthrough. Some people at Amazon went as far as to call the claims made by Microsoft, nothing but serious hype. On the other hand, Amazon tried to steal the limelight with its own breakthrough findings. This includes a new quantum computing chip called Ocelot. Meanwhile, Google shared its own quantum chip called Willow late last year. Image: DIW-AigenRead next: YouTube Tests Automated Ad Reviews to Boost Creator Monetization",

        "description": "Construction at a CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia.Nathan Howard/Getty ImagesData centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to the US economy from 2017 to 2023, a PwC study says.Most of those jobs were attributed to \"the multiplier effect,\" a standard and controversial model.Data centers require a massive amount of skilled labor during construction, and less after.When President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, he said the massive AI infrastructure project—a joint venture formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank—would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.\"Little evidence supports the accuracy of Trump's statement, though he wouldn't be the first politician to suggest that data centers are a boon for job creation. The data center industry has grown rapidly in recent years, and state governors have touted the jobs it would create.A new study from PwC supports these claims, reporting that data centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to national employment in 2023, up 60% from 2017. While the data center market has grown rapidly in recent years and has been fueled by the rise of cloud computing and AI, most of those jobs aren't direct tech jobs. Economic development experts are divided over the accuracy of the study, which was sponsored by data center industry lobbying group Data Center Coalition.Big Tech companies spent a combined estimated $246 billion in capital expenditures last year, much of which was on data center expansion. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are expected to spend another $320 billion in capital expenditures this year.State and local government officials have touted the number of jobs that would result from all the new development. However, once built, data center facilities don't employ large numbers of permanent employees, and the economic development contracts they sign in exchange for tax incentives often reflect that.In a press release announcing Amazon's $10 billion data center expansion in Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said in December that the investment would support \"thousands\" of jobs. Documents filed with the Ohio Department of Development showed that Amazon is committed to creating 1,058 new jobs, none of which are required to be full-time, salaried positions.The data center industry overhypes job creationOf the 4.7 million jobs attributed to the data center industry in the PwC study, only 603,900 were actual industry jobs, otherwise known as \"direct\" jobs.The Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group that counts Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta as members, commissioned the PwC study, which grouped jobs into three categories — \"direct,\" \"indirect,\" and \"induced.\"A \"direct\" job, the study said, is any job — full-time, part-time, or self-employed — tied to the operation of the data center. An \"indirect\" job refers to a full-time, part-time, or self-employed job created to produce necessary goods and services in a data center's supply chain. \"Induced\" jobs are jobs that result from spending that occurs in an area due to the data center's presence there.Nearly 4.1 million data center jobs — the vast majority of the total number of data center jobs accounted for in PwC's study — were considered indirect and induced. Indirect and induced jobs can comprise a wide range of potential positions, from the construction and maintenance of data centers to jobs in the local service industry near the data centers. The service sector, which includes everything from tourism, hospitality, and retail, to healthcare and financial services, accounted for 60% of the data center industry's induced jobs.\"DCC asked PwC to quantify the economic contributions made by the data center industry nationally as well as in each state and the District of Columbia. The report and analysis were conducted independently by PwC using publicly available government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics,\" a Data Center Coalition spokesperson said.Some economists say induced and indirect jobs can be difficult to accurately quantify.Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas's Department of Government, questioned the study's estimate of the number of jobs created by the data center industry.\"The economic impact of these projects aren't particularly high,\" Jensen said. \"It's head-shaking to me how you could come up with that jobs number.\"PwC used IMPLAN, an economic modeling software that is considered an industry standard for economic impact analysis and data. While IMPLAN has been used since the late 1970s to demonstrate potential job creation for a variety of industries, Jensen said the program is vulnerable to misuse.\"There's a lot of controversy around IMPLAN,\" he said. \"It's often used to justify economic development incentives.\"IMPLAN's model relies on the North American Industry Classification System, which the federal government uses to classify businesses, to determine the \"multiplier effect\" of an economic development project to measure the overall impact on the local economy.PwC determined that the data center industry has a multiplier effect of 7.5, meaning that every direct data center job leads to another 7.5 jobs elsewhere in the US economy.Jensen said a multiplier effect of one or two is likely more accurate.The data center boom creates construction jobsData centers do offer significant job creation opportunities, said John Boyd Jr., principal at site selection advisory The Boyd Co. — it's just that the jobs are in unexpected places.Construction jobs are bigger and more important to the data center industry than people realize, he said. Boyd's firm has helped large corporations like AT&T, Dell, and Visa choose locations for major development projects, and it has also advised government agencies on economic development deals.\"The actual amount of on-site labor is enormous, and wages are over double the national average for construction workers,\" Boyd said of data center projects.This is because data center construction requires skilled labor across a variety of expertise.\"You're looking at cooling systems, natural gas turbines, specialized server equipment,\" he said.Construction workers often travel to data center sites and stay for extended periods of time, which leads to a need for hotels, restaurants, and other services. The data center development boom has led to a surge in occupancy rates at properties owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, CEO Geoff Ballotti said on the company earnings call in February.Data centers also require routine and specialized maintenance after they are built, leading to a continued need for skilled labor nearby.The industry tends to cluster together. Once one data center is located in a certain area, others tend to follow. Ballotti said Wyndham's business development experts are focusing on expansion in areas near Jackson, Mississippi, and Columbus, Ohio, because of that.\"These aren't one and done,\" Boyd said.Read the original article on Business Insider Construction at a CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia.Nathan Howard/Getty ImagesData centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to the US economy from 2017 to 2023, a PwC study says.Most of those jobs were attributed to \"the multiplier effect,\" a standard and controversial model.Data centers require a massive amount of skilled labor during construction, and less after.When President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, he said the massive AI infrastructure project—a joint venture formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank—would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.\"Little evidence supports the accuracy of Trump's statement, though he wouldn't be the first politician to suggest that data centers are a boon for job creation.

Financial technology firm FIS has introduced a new AI-powered offering for treasurers. The company’s “Treasury GPT,” unveiled Monday (March 10), is an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven product support tool created in collaboration with Microsoft, using that company’s Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. “Corporate treasurers have a major role to play in their organizations, but emerging risks and expanded responsibilities can create disharmony and disruption to their strategies and workflows,” JP James, head of treasury and risk at FIS, said in a news release. “In this fast-changing environment, having access to the best tools and innovations is what will keep corporate treasurers ahead of the curve. By launching Treasury GPT, we’re giving our customers a competitive edge that can unlock the power and capabilities of FIS solutions and steer their companies to growth.” The release added that companies can use Treasury GPT to reference “product documentation and use machine learning through Azure OpenAI Service to quickly provide FIS users with high-quality, informed guidance.” This allows clients “to focus less on low-value administrative tasks and more on liquidity management and strategy,” the company said. FIS pointed out that this launch is happening as a majority of companies say that AI will impact their businesses, if it hasn’t already. As noted here last week, research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that nearly 90% of surveyed chief financial officers (CFOs) reported a “very positive” ROI from the technology, a sharp increase from just 26% in March 2024. That’s according to PYMNTS recent CAIO Report, which examines how CFOs are enjoying the benefits of GenAI and where they continue to face obstacles. “While CFOs are adopting GenAI, trust in the technology is paramount, especially in critical business functions like risk management and financial reporting, PYMNTS wrote. “Consider that 97% of CFOs expressed high or complete trust in GenAI’s output in risk management, while 98% trusted it for strategic decision-making. The ability of GenAI to work with internal data, which CFOs are familiar with and confident in, plays a significant role in this trust.” However, trust is not universal, the research found. There are persistent concerns about GenAI’s output, especially around accuracy and data security. Close to 30% of CFOs are concerned that GenAI might yield less insightful results, while 22% pointed to potential issues surrounding the integrity of its outputs. Data security is also a concern, with 28% worrying about unauthorized access to sensitive information. For all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.

        "description": "Does it feel to you like there are way too many AI assistants to keep track of? Between ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, and others, it’s hard to remember what each one excels at—if anything. Beyond just the underlying differences in large language models, each AI assistant has its own features, integrations, premium features, and peculiarities. I’m writing this guide both for myself and for anyone who wants to stay informed about generative AI. While I have some reservations, I also think it’s worth keeping an eye on what’s available. Rather than getting into the technical details of how these AI assistants work, I’ll focus on what they can actually do. ChatGPT by OpenAI The most recognizable name in generative AI is also the most fleshed out as a standalone consumer tech product, with features like web search, a built-in document editor, and a conversational voice mode. ChatGPT also provides one of the most robust free tiers of any AI assistant, with all but its most bleeding-edge features available in some capacity without a subscription. Notable features: Voice mode for engaging in back-and-forth conversation, including an advanced version with more emotive responses. Traits that define how ChatGPT should converse with you. Temporary chats that don’t appear in your history and don’t train OpenAI’s models. Canvas document editor that uses AI to generate and revise content. Web-search for bringing in real-time information. GPTs that bring in information from third-party apps and services. Reason button that offers more in-depth problem solving and decision making. Price: Free for limited model access, $20 per month for more advanced models and new features, $200 per month for unlimited access to experimental features. Claude by Anthropic As The New York Times has noted, Claude is a favorite among AI insiders for its sense of emotional intelligence, with responses that are “less like the generic prose generated by other chatbots.” While its features are on the bare-bones side—it can’t search the web and lacks a voice conversation mode (for now)—it does offer some helpful features for creating and interacting with documents. Notable features: Projects mode, which lets you upload documents and data for context in your chats. Artifacts, which are standalone documents and image files you can download for use in other apps. Styles, which let you refine how Claude writes its responses. You can even upload a document for Claude to try and mimic. Price: Free for limited usage. $20 per month for additional models, reasoning, and the Projects feature. Google Gemini Google’s AI products are more diffuse than some of its startup rivals. While Gemini exists in standalone form on the web and in mobile apps—and serves as the default voice assistant on newer Android phones—it also generates summaries in Google Search, and is baked into other Google products such as Gmail, Docs, and Chrome. All this makes Gemini a bit tricky to quantify as a whole, except that it feels unavoidable if you regularly use Google’s products. Notable features: Extensions for interacting with other (mostly Google) services, for instance by summarizing YouTube videos or flagging important message from Gmail. Gemini Live for free-flowing voice conversations. Google Assistant features such as smart home control and reminders. NotebookLM, a separate but popular product that can analyze your documents, create summaries, and even turn them into podcasts. Price: Free, with $20 per month Gemini Advanced subscription for Workspace integration, book-length document analysis, and more advanced models. Microsoft Copilot Just as Gemini is built into Google products, Copilot is weaved into Microsoft’s Windows operating system, Office suite, and Edge browser. Its actual capabilities aren’t much different from other AI assistants—it primarily uses OpenAI’s large language models—but it’s easier to access if you’re deep into Microsoft’s ecosystem. (Microsoft’s GitHub also has its own version of Copilot for programmers.) Notable features: Office tie-ins, including writing assistance in Word and spreadsheet analysis in Excel. Think Deeper offers access to OpenAI’s reasoning models. Copilot Voice offers free-flowing voice conversations both on desktop and mobile devices. Edge sidebar lets you summarize and ask about web pages. Pricing: Free for limited usage, requires Microsoft 365 (starting at $10 per month) for full Office integration, $20 per month Copilot Pro for advanced models, early features, and Copilot in Office web apps. DeepSeek DeepSeek, the product of a previously-obscure Chinese company, shook up the AI world earlier this year, offering performance on par with OpenAI’s latest models with training costs that were apparently miniscule (though later disputed). It’s also raised privacy concerns over the data it sends to China, and it won’t talk about topics that are censored in China, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre. Even so, American companies are now looking to use DeepSeek’s open-source code, including Microsoft, which is offering local DeepSeek models on Qualcomm-powered PCs, and Nvidia, which offers its own online version. As for DeepSeek’s own app, it’s a bit on the crude side, but it offers image recognition, document scanning, web search, and a “DeepThink” reasoning model for problem solving and decision making. Notable features: Unlimited access to DeepSeek’s latest models. Pricing: Free. Grok While Elon Musk’s AI assistant looks like a lot of its rivals on the surface, it has a kind of edgelord sensibility lurking underneath. Grok won’t flat-out tell you how to build a pipe bomb, for instance, but it won’t shut the conversation down, either. Instead, it’ll encourage you to ask more about pipe bombs in general and give you details about how they work when prompted. (Meanwhile, researchers have coaxed into providing dangerous weapon-building instructions in detail.) Notable features: Voice modes with distinct personalities, including “unhinged” and “sexy” versions. “Think” and “DeepSearch” modes that reason through answers and pull information from online sources, respectively. Price: Free with limited use of the latest models, $30 per month for increased rate limits and access to Think, DeepSearch, and voice modes. Perplexity This GPT-based AI tool started off as an alternative to traditional web search, but has since evolved into a more all-encompassing personal assistant with tools for managing documents and interacting with apps. It’s also developing its own web browser. (In other words, it’s becoming less reliant on scaping websites against their wishes.) Notable features: Web search results, with summaries and citations. Spaces for summarizing and analyzing documents. Agent features on Android devices, including music playback, reminders, and calendar interactions. Discover section with AI-generated news summaries. Price: Free for basic web search with some usage limits on other features, $20 per month for more deep research usage, unlimited document uploads, and a choice of AI models. Duck.ai With Duck.ai, DuckDuckGo offers a more privacy-focused alternative to the major AI assistants. DuckDuckGo says it’s made agreements with major AI providers so they won’t train their models on your data, and will only store it for 30 days at most. There’s no document interaction or voice chat, but it’s good enough for basic conversations. Private chat history that’s stored on your device, not online. Choice of large language models, including GPT-4o, Llama 3.3, Claude 3, o3-mini, and Mistral. AI answers in search results, with an option to customize how often they appear. Price: Free A few others Siri: While the current version of Siri isn’t based on large language models—and may not be for years—it will occasionally ask ChatGPT for answers on devices that support Apple Intelligence. Alexa+: Amazon’s just-announced AI overhaul promises more conversational capabilities than the old Alexa while still offering features like home automation, music playback, and TV suggestions. It’s launching on select Echo Show devices in an “early access period” next month. Meta AI: This one’s powered by Meta’s llama open-source models but is pretty basic as a consumer-facing product. It’s only available on the web or as a feature of the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. Standalone mobile apps are reportedly coming.",

        "description": "A new scientific study warns that using artificial intelligence can erode our capacity for critical thinking. The research, carried out by a Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University scientific team, found that the dependence on AI tools without questioning their validity reduces the cognitive effort applied to the work. In other words: AI can make us dumber if we use it wrong. “AI can synthesize ideas, enhance reasoning, and encourage critical engagement, pushing us to see beyond the obvious and challenge our assumptions,” Lev Tankelevitch, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research and coauthor of the study, tells me in an email interview. But to reap those benefits, Tankelevitch says users need to treat AI as a thought partner, not just a tool for finding information faster. Much of this comes down to designing a user experience that encourages critical thinking rather than passive reliance. By making AI’s reasoning processes more transparent and prompting users to verify and refine AI-generated content, a well-designed AI interface can act as a thought partner rather than a substitute for human judgment. From ‘task execution’ to ‘task stewardship’ The research—which surveyed 319 professionals—found that high confidence in AI tools often reduces the cognitive effort people apply to their work. “Higher confidence in AI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking,” the study states. This over-reliance stems from a mental model that assumes AI is competent in simple tasks. As one participant admitted in the study, “it’s a simple task and I knew ChatGPT could do it without difficulty, so I just never thought about it.” Critical thinking didn’t feel relevant because, well, who cares. This mindset has major implications for the future of work. Tankelevitch tells me that AI is shifting knowledge workers from “task execution” to “task stewardship.” Instead of manually performing tasks, professionals now oversee AI-generated content, making decisions about its accuracy and integration. “They must actively oversee, guide, and refine AI-generated work rather than simply accepting the first output,” Tankelevitch says. The study highlights that when knowledge workers actively evaluate AI-generated outputs rather than passively accepting them, they can improve their decision-making processes. “Research also shows that experts who effectively apply their knowledge when working with AI see a boost in output,” Tankelevitch points out. “AI works best when it complements human expertise—driving better decisions and stronger outcomes.” The study found that many knowledge workers struggle to critically engage with AI-generated outputs because they lack the necessary domain knowledge to assess their accuracy. “Even if users recognize that AI might be wrong, they don’t always have the expertise to correct it,” Tankelevitch explains. This problem is particularly acute in technical fields where AI-generated code, data analysis, or financial reports require deep subject matter knowledge to verify. The cognitive offloading paradox Confidence in AI can lead to a problem called cognitive offloading. This phenomenon isn’t new. Humans have long outsourced mental tasks to tools, from calculators to GPS devices. Cognitive offloading is not inherently negative. When done correctly, it allows users to focus on higher-order thinking rather than mundane, repetitive tasks, Tankelevitch points out. But the very nature of generative AI—which produces complex text, code, and analysis—brings a new level of potential mistakes and problems. Many people might blindly accept AI outputs without questioning them (and quite often these outputs are bad or just plain wrong). This is especially the case when people feel the task is not important. “Our study suggests that when people view a task as low-stakes, they may not review outputs as critically,” Tankelevitch points out. The role of UX AI developers should keep that idea in mind when designing AI user experiences. These chat UX should be organized in a way that encourages verification, prompting users to think through the reasoning behind AI-generated content. Redesigning AI interfaces to aid in this new “task stewardship” process and encourage critical engagement is key to mitigating the risks of cognitive offloading. “Deep reasoning models are already supporting this by making AI’s processes more transparent—making it easier for users to review, question, and learn from the insights they generate,” he says. “Transparency matters. Users need to understand not just what the AI says, but why it says it.” You probably have seen this in an AI platform like Perplexity. Its interface offers a clear logical path that outlines the thoughts and actions that the AI takes to obtain a result. By redesigning AI interfaces to also include contextual explanations, confidence ratings, or alternative perspectives when needed, AI tools can shift users away from blind trust and towards active evaluation of the results. Another UX intervention may involve actively prompting the user for key aspects of the AI-generated output, prompting users to directly question and refine these outputs rather than passively accepting them.The final product of this open collaboration between AI and human is better, just like creative processes are often much better when two people work together as a team, especially when the strengths of one person complements the strengths of the other. Some will get dumber The study raises crucial questions about the long-term impact of AI on human cognition. If knowledge workers become passive consumers of AI-generated content, their critical thinking skills could atrophy. However, if AI is designed and used as an interactive, thought-provoking tool, it could enhance human intelligence rather than degrade it. Tankelevitch points out that this is not just theory. It’s been proven on the field. For example, there are studies that show that AI can boost learning when used in the right way, he says. “In Nigeria, an early study suggests that AI tutors could help students achieve two years of learning progress in just six weeks,” he says. “Another study showed that students working with tutors supported by AI were more likely to master key topics.” The key, Tankelevitch tells me, is that this was all teacher-led: “Educators guided the prompts and provided context,” thus encouraging that vital critical thinking. AI has also demonstrated that it can enhance problem-solving in scientific research, where experts use it to explore complex hypotheses. “Researchers using AI to assist in discovery still rely on human intuition and critical judgment to validate results,” Tankelevitch notes. “The most successful AI applications are those where human oversight remains central.” Given the current state of generative AI, the technology’s effect on human intelligence will not depend on the AI itself, but on how we choose to use it. UX designers can certainly help promote good behavior, but it’s up to us to do the right thing. AI can either amplify or erode critical thinking, depending on whether we critically engage with its outputs or blindly trust them. The future of AI-assisted work will be determined not by the sophistication of the technology but by humans. My bet, as with every other technological revolution in the history of civilization, some people will get a lot dumber and others will get a lot smarter.",

        "description": "Shifting political headwinds and escalating energy demands are shining a spotlight on Big Tech’s backpedaling on climate commitments. Companies like Meta and Microsoft, who were once vocal about their clean energy goals, are now pivoting towards dirty fossil fuels, pointing to deepened corporate complicity in an era of silence on climate action. Tech titans such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have lined up to buy access to the new administration and have remained largely silent in the face of the new administration’s attacks on clean energy. This is a sharp pivot from Trump 1.0 when these companies overwhelmingly spoke up against the decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement. This time: crickets. A recent survey among U.S. adults indicates growing unpopularity for figures like Mark Zuckerberg, coinciding with deeply concerning trends in corporate behavior that appears to support an increasingly unlawful and autocratic federal administration. While Zuckerberg assures employees that the company is “holding true to its values,” he has also made it clear that a “productive partnership with the U.S. government” is a priority amid dramatic policy shifts. In recent weeks, Meta has ditched its fact-checking program; rolled back hate speech protections; cut back diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; and is full steam ahead with a $10 billion, 4 million-square-feet natural gas-powered data center in Louisiana that fuels pollution and accelerates fossil fuel reliance. Even though nearly 70% of the world’s 500 largest companies have a public climate commitment, the world’s largest tech companies, once leaders in the corporate climate commitment space, are abandoning their emissions targets. In light of this alarming about-face, tech workers should ask themselves if they support their company’s currying favor with a billionaire-led agenda that undermines environmental protections, rolls back climate rules, scrubs scientific databases and clean energy funding, and accelerates the production of climate change disinformation. If not in support of these trends, employees should actively use their influence to engage coworkers and press their leaders for responsive action. Some may decide that they can no longer be complicit in their employer’s backtracking on climate action, and will choose to leave—but we believe there is still opportunity to change companies from within. In the past, Silicon Valley employees have engaged a number of tools to exercise internal advocacy muscles: employee walkouts, protests, open letters, petitions. And those tactics sparked change. More recently, employees can follow the example of internal employee advocates such as those in Microsoft’s Sustainability Connected Community who have been elevating climate policy as a top company priority. Their advocacy led to Microsoft’s first Sustainability Policy Alignment Report last year focused on U.S. trade associations, spotlighting the company’s misalignment with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which consistently works to block climate policy progress). As a result, Microsoft committed to addressing lobbying misalignment, stating “we will redouble efforts to engage with the trade association to drive closer alignment in their advocacy for a more sustainable future.” Employees have organized events and educational webinars to engage coworkers and raise awareness, invited meetings with company leaders, sent emails to decision makers, asked questions at town hall meetings, and posted calls to action and engagement opportunities on internal message boards. This year, employees across companies such as Alphabet, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Pinterest, and Salesforce are also exchanging ideas and sharing best practices in order to amplify positive action. For those who choose to leave their company, advocacy might look like former tech employees who have launched a new Enabled Emissions Campaign, a global effort to curb the use of advanced technology for increased fossil fuel production. Those with inside knowledge of how AI is being developed might choose to speak up on how “We’re Wrong About AI,” as Will Alpine, a former Microsoft employee who built tech behind ChatGPT, did last month. Over these next four years, it will be essential to hold the line on climate action and clean energy deployment—and while employees should actively work for change, corporate leadership and investors must ultimately take responsibility and step up. Employees, however, have a critical role to play and should hold companies accountable when they don’t. Sustainability professionals should especially be empowered to provide reasoned and diplomatic calls to action that are in line with what science tells us about planetary boundaries. If you’re a sustainability professional, now is the time to publicly commit to advocating for climate policy, as more than 1,000 have done by signing the LEAD Statement. Big Tech leaders have previously acknowledged the climate crisis and been major buyers of renewable energy. With the growth of AI data centers, they should be advocating for clean energy rather than doubling down on continued dirty fossil fuel dependency. Leaders and employees must leverage their influence by continuing to prioritize clean energy action and supporting the development of the clean energy infrastructure. This includes supporting the maintenance of federal clean energy tax credits, upholding federal pollution and energy efficiency standards, prioritizing energy efficient and clean energy powered AI, and elevating climate-related financial risk as a serious and material risk to businesses and communities, especially the role of extreme weather events. There has never been a more important time to speak up. The decisions made by corporations today will have a profound and lasting impact on our environment, our society, and our future. There is no time to wait.",

        "description": "Charles O'Rear/Getty, thawornnurak/Getty, valiantsin suprunovich/Getty, twomeows/Getty, aluxum/Getty, Tyler Le/BITech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to develop a functional quantum computer.Each has released a prototype quantum chip with different approaches and potential applications.The field is rapidly evolving, but major hurdles remain before it becomes commercially useful.The quantum race is heating up.Tech titans Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft each recently announced advancements in their prototype chips, tightening the race to develop a commercially useful quantum computer that could solve some of the universe's stickiest problems faster than a classical computer ever could.Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving — though still largely theoretical and deeply technical — field. But cracking it open could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, among other outcomes, researchers say.Naturally, each of the major players in Big Tech wants to be the one to take quantum computing mainstream.\"You're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point,\" Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services, told Business Insider in late February, following the company's announcement of its Ocelot chip.Stick with us — here's where it gets complicated.Where classical computing uses binary digits — 0s and 1s, called bits — to represent information, quantum computing relies on a foundation built from the quantum equivalent of bits, called qubits. When they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits allow quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.However, qubits are unstable, and their behavior is unpredictable. They require specific conditions, such as low light and extremely cold environments, to reduce errors. When the number of qubits is increased, the error rate goes up — making advancement in the field slowgoing.Small-scale quantum computers already exist, but the race is on to scale them up and make them useful to a wider audience rather than just scientists.Recently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have announced new prototype chips, and IBM has made strides in its existing quantum road map. Each company is using unique approaches to solve the error reduction and scalability problems that have long plagued the field and make useful quantum computing a reality.Here's how each approach stacks up.MicrosoftMicrosoft's Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits.MicrosoftApproach to quantum: Topological qubitsMost powerful machine: Majorana 1In February, Microsoft unveiled its new quantum chip, Majorana 1. The aim is for the chip to speed up the development of large-scale quantum computers from decades to years.Microsoft said the chip uses a new state of matter to produce \"topological\" qubits that are less prone to errors and more stable. Essentially, this is a qubit based on a topological state of matter, which isn't a liquid, gas, or solid. As a result, these quantum particles could retain a \"memory\" of their position over time and move around each other. Information, therefore, could be stored across the whole qubit, so if any parts fail, the topological qubit could still hold key pieces of information and become more fault-resistant.\"Microsoft's progress is the hardest to get an idea about because it's very niche,\" said Tom Darras, founder of quantum computing startup Welinq. \"Even experts in the industry find it difficult to assess the quality of these results.\"Quantum experts agree that Microsoft still has many roadblocks to overcome, and its peer-reviewed Nature paper only demonstrates aspects of what its researchers have claimed to achieve — but some in the quantum ecosystem see it as a promising outcome.GoogleGoogle researchers are aiming to reverse a long-standing qubit problem.GoogleApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: WillowIn December, Google announced Willow, its newest quantum chip, which the company claims takes just five minutes to solve a problem that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years.Perhaps more impressive was Google's breakthrough in how quantum computers scale. Historically, the more qubits that are added, and the more powerful the computer becomes, the more prone it is to errors. With Willow, Google's researchers said that adding more physical qubits to a quantum processor actually made it less error-prone, reversing the typical phenomenon.Known as \"below threshold,\" the accomplishment marks a significant milestone by cracking a problem that has been around since the 1990s. In a study published in Nature, Google's researchers posit this breakthrough could finally offer a way to build a useful large-scale quantum computer. However, much of this is still theoretical, and now Google will need to prove it in practice.AmazonA superconducting-qubit quantum chip being wire-bonded to a circuit board at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing in Pasadena, Calif.Amazon Web ServicesApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: OcelotIn late February, Amazon Web Services announced its Ocelot chip, a prototype designed to advance the company's focus on cloud-based quantum computing.An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the Ocelot prototype demonstrated the potential to increase efficiency in quantum error correction by up to 90% compared to conventional approaches. The chip leverages a unique architecture that integrates cat qubit technology — named for the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment — and additional quantum error correction components that can be manufactured using processes borrowed from the electronics industry.Troy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that Amazon's Ocelot chip is another building block that the industry will use to build a functioning quantum computer. However, its error rate needs to be substantially lowered, and its chips would require more qubit density before they're useful.\"There's lots of challenges ahead. What Amazon gained in error correction was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip,\" Nelson said. \"We're still in prototype days, and we still have multiple years to go, but they've made a great leap forward.\"IBMCES patrons take a look as IBM unveils this quantum computer, Q System One.Ross D. Franklin/ASSOCIATED PRESSApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubitsMost powerful machine: CondorIBM has been a quantum frontrunner for some time, with several different prototype chips and its development of Q System One, the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, unveiled in January 2019.IBM's Condor chip is the company's most powerful in terms of its number of qubits. However, since its development, IBM has focused its approach on the quality of its gate operations and making its newer quantum chips modular so multiple smaller, less error-prone chips can be combined to make more powerful quantum computing machines.Condor, the second-largest quantum processor ever made, was unveiled at the IBM Quantum Summit 2023 on December 4, 2023. At the same time, IBM debuted its Heron chip, a 133-qubit processor with a lower error rate.Rob Schoelkopf, cofounder and chief scientist of Quantum Circuits, told Business Insider that IBM has prioritized \"error mitigation\" over traditional error correction approaches. While IBM has so far been successful in what Schoelkopf calls \"brute force scaling\" with this approach, he said the methodology will need to be modified in the long run for efficiency.Who leads the race?Sankar Das Sarma, a theoretical condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland, told Business Insider that the Amazon Web Services Ocelot chip, Google's Willow, and IBM's Condor use a \"more conventional\" superconducting approach to quantum development compared to other competitors.By contrast, Microsoft's approach is based on topological Majorana zero modes, which also have a superconductor, but in \"a radically different manner,\" he said. If the Majorana 1 chip works correctly, Das Sarma added, it is protected topologically with minimal need for error correction, compared to claims from other tech companies that they have improved conventional error correction methods.Still, each company's approach is \"very different,\" Das Sarma said. \"It is premature to comment on who is ahead since the whole subject is basically in the initial development phase.\"Big Tech companies should be cautious about \"raising expectations when promoting results,\" said Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO of quantum computing startup Pasqal. \"Otherwise, you could create disillusionment.\"Reymond's sentiment was echoed by IBM's VP of quantum adoption and business development, Scott Crowder, who told Business Insider he is concerned \"over-hype\" could lead people to discount quantum technology before its promise can be realized.\"We think we are on the cusp of demonstrating quantum advantage,\" said Crowder, referring to when a quantum computer outperforms classical machines. \"But the industry is still a few years from a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Charles O'Rear/Getty, thawornnurak/Getty, valiantsin suprunovich/Getty, twomeows/Getty, aluxum/Getty, Tyler Le/BITech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to develop a functional quantum computer.Each has released a prototype quantum chip with different approaches and potential applications.The field is rapidly evolving, but major hurdles remain before it becomes commercially useful.The quantum race is heating up.Tech titans Amazon, Google, IBM",

Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Reflection AI emerged from stealth Friday (March 7), saying it is focused on building autonomous coding systems. “At Reflection, we’re building superintelligent autonomous systems,” the company said in a Friday post on LinkedIn. “We believe that solving autonomous coding will enable superintelligence more broadly.” A Friday Bloomberg article to which the post linked said that Reflection raised $130 million, including a $25 million seed funding round led by Sequoia Capital and CRV and a $105 million Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and CRV. The company was founded by two former research scientists at Alphabet’s AI unit, Google DeepMind: Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou, according to the report. Reflection aims to build tools that are fully autonomous, rather than being co-pilots or assistants, and to develop superintelligence, which is AI that is smarter than most humans, the report said. The company already has paying customers in financial services, technology and other sectors that have large coding teams, per the report. Sequoia said in a Friday blog post that coding assistants already help developers increase their speed and productivity tenfold and that autonomous coding agents are the next leap forward. “Reflection’s autonomous coding agents integrate directly into an organization’s codebase and engineering workflows, and autonomously tackle well-scoped engineering tasks entirely end-to-end,” Sequoia’s post said. “They read, write, test and deploy code, handling all the infrastructure on your behalf, relieving the burden of entire engineering workloads from developers and teams.” CRV said in a Friday blog post that the technology Reflection is building “has the potential to redefine industries.” “Imagine a world where engineering teams can tackle their backlogs in days instead of months, where code migrations happen seamlessly and where cyber vulnerabilities are remediated before they become critical,” CRV’s post said. “This is the world Reflection AI is building.” Lightspeed said in a Friday blog post that Reflection AI’s approach to scaling the autonomous capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) brings AI closer to superintelligence. “Their system can plan, debug and execute complex programming tasks autonomously — a leap forward that positions Reflection AI as a major player in the future of intelligent software engineering and beyond,” the Lightspeed post said.

Nearly 1 million Windows devices were targeted in recent months by a sophisticated \"malvertising\" campaign that surreptitiously stole login credentials, cryptocurrency, and other sensitive information from infected machines, Microsoft said. The campaign began in December, when the attackers, who remain unknown, seeded websites with links that downloaded ads from malicious servers. The links led targeted machines through several intermediary sites until finally arriving at repositories on Microsoft-owned Github, which hosted a raft of malicious files. Chain of events The malware was loaded in four stages, each of which acted as a building block for the next.

Microsoft is reportedly testing artificial intelligence (AI) models from other companies that could replace OpenAI’s models in Copilot. The tech giant is also training models that could compete directly with OpenAI’s, both for use in Copilot and for sale to outside developers who could add them to their own apps, Reuters reported Friday (March 7), citing a paywalled article from The Information that cited unnamed sources. Microsoft has completed training of a family of models that perform nearly as well as OpenAI’s leading models on commonly accepted benchmarks, according to the report. Microsoft did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Reuters reported in December that Microsoft was considering powering Copilot with in-house and third-party models, according to the report. Microsoft is a major backer of OpenAI and benefited from its early partnership with the company but has been looking to diversify its technology and reduce its costs, the report said. It was reported in August that Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors in its fiscal 2024 report. Microsoft counts OpenAI among its competitors in the search and news advertising fields, along with Google and various social media platforms. While the relationship between the two firms has been critical — with Microsoft turning to OpenAI for help in building AI systems, while also giving the small company financial backing to the tune of $13 billion — the companies’ desire to tap a greater share of the AI market put them at odds. Microsoft disclosed in a January blog post that it would no longer be OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider for its AI models, and instead would have the right of first refusal to host OpenAI’s AI workloads in Azure. This marked a change in their 2019 agreement, when Microsoft became OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider after investing $1 billion in OpenAI, PYMNTS reported at the time of the blog post. The investment was also three years before ChatGPT and generative AI took the world by storm. At the same time, the blog post said Microsoft would retain the exclusive rights to OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), which is how most companies access and integrate the startup’s AI models into their own applications, products or services.

        "description": "LinkedIn just shared its latest disclosure report for the EU. The popular social networking platform witnessed a slight rise in users from the region during the second part of 2024. However, it also noted a rise in scams and fake profile accounts on the app. Under the DSA, the app needs to provide more insights and be transparent about usage and efforts for moderating content online every six months. This is where such a report comes in handy.The app shared the latest report during the start of the week, where it provided some more notes on the complete usage and enforcement. This provides more real data than what we see on the app’s limited performance reports. For starters, LinkedIn shared 52 million people logging in every month while 142 million logged out. Over time, the figures for active users keep rising in the region, but they did manage to slow in the past six months of last year.Other valuable points worth a mention are how these stats provide a real-time view of the platform’s active user figures as compared to total users that it likes reporting. As can be seen, the app is boasting about having a userbase hitting one billion people. However, both members and active users are quite different, especially when you look at this from an advertiser’s point of view.What is more valuable is how so many such members are utilizing the platform each day or every month. Again, the app is not sharing that but depending on the EU member count and the active user base as shared from the DSA, we know that just 28% of the platform’s audience in the EU would be hailed as active users.If that is true for specific regions, then we know that this app’s MAU figures are more along the lines of 280M as compared to hitting the billion member figures for headlines.Maybe America is seeing more users and perhaps that’s what is giving the 300M total MAU. But in comparison, the app’s active engaged members are much like that seen on Reddit than other apps like Instagram, X, or Pinterest.As far as spam and fake accounts are concerned, LinkedIn has similarly seen a rise in the previous report. There was an 11,000 rise in spam reports from different users and a 13,000 rise in fake profiles.However, that did not severely impact the stats as the effect overall was minor. However, the fact that there is a rise in attention on the app is also going to bump spam. This is another element worth a mention in such reports.Worth mentioning too is how there is a decline in spam on the app through the auto detection and enforcement endeavors during this time. Remember, the app’s disclosures provide some very interesting insights on the app’s growth and activity. This comes alongside key notes regarding actual usage against a combination of the sign-ups seen on LinkedIn.This might assist users in making more informed decisions about the app’s outreach. So for now, we see LinkedIn as a strong contender in the world of social media. Read next: X Shares Its Second Transparency Report Showing 19% Decline in Spam",

        "description": "Software giant Microsoft just shared alarming news about a malvertising campaign that attacked both user and enterprise devices. The tech giant shared how two different websites were offering pirated means for video streaming that would redirect the users to malware, using ads. The number of users impacted was outlined to be in the thousands.The dangerous advertising campaign affected up to million devices around the globe, in what was called out as an opportunistic attack to steal data, the head of Microsoft’s safety decision mentioned in its latest report.The firm was also able to trace infections to two different video stream domains and how ads were redirecting people to scam sites showing tech support. This would forward the users to other pages like Dropbox, GitHub, and Discord that were seen hosting this malware.The company failed to go into the details on what such scam pages looked like, but they were motivating people to install programs that were looting the system and disguised as malware. They could attain user data or even take over their phones or computers, the report shared.The attack also made efforts to disguise how malicious it was by utilizing signed software certificates when delivering some real files via the starting payload. The first stage of this campaign was outlined to be the middle of January this year. They were digitally signed and featured newly designed certificates. Total of 12 such certificates were outlined, all of which were revoked.Such attacks were created to deliver another stage of payload that can collect the data from the PC and return it back to the server belonging to the hacker. It would also have the ability to successfully download more malware onto a device that enables hackers to spy on various browsing actions and even communication with active browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. The tech giant also mentioned how they saw the attack first unfold starting early December. The campaign reportedly affected a wide number of companies and industries, alongside user devices. This highlighted different attacks, it shared.GitHub that is under the ownership of Microsoft seems to now have deleted the pages hosting the malicious campaign. As per Microsoft, it's built-in Defender for Windows can highlight and flag malware that is used for attacks.

Amazon executives aren't buying it.On February 19, Microsoft unveiled a new quantum processor called Majorana 1. The company said the chip uses a new type of architecture that could allow quantum computers to store way more data and perform much more complex calculations.On the same day, Simone Severini, Amazon's head of quantum technologies, emailed CEO Andy Jassy casting doubt on Microsoft's claims, according to a copy of the email obtained by Business Insider.Severini wrote that Microsoft's underlying scientific paper, released in Nature, \"doesn't actually demonstrate\" the claimed achievement and only showed that the new chip \"could potentially enable future experiments.\"He also noted that Microsoft has a checkered history of \"several retracted papers due to scientific misconduct\" in the quantum computing space, adding that some of the company's earlier research had to be withdrawn. The email was also shared with several other executives, including Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman and SVP James Hamilton.\"This seems to be a meaningful technical advancement, but it's far different from the breakthrough being portrayed in the media coverage,\" Severini wrote in the email.

The hope is to one day create machines that enable significant strides in areas like drug discovery or chemical compound creation. In recent months, Amazon and Google have also unveiled new quantum chips.But their efforts to outduel each other could generate more hype than substance, according to industry experts.Arka Majumdar, a computer engineering professor at the University of Washington, told BI that Microsoft's technological achievements are impressive but \"insignificant\" compared to what is needed to create a useful quantum computer. He added Microsoft's claims appear \"sensational\" and \"overhyped,\" given they haven't reached meaningful scale.Scott Aaronson, a renowned quantum computing researcher and computer science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out in a blog post that Microsoft's claim to have created a topological qubit \"has not yet been accepted by peer review.\"The peer review file of Microsoft's Nature report states that the \"results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices,\" and the work is intended to introduce an architecture that \"might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.\"In an email to BI, a Microsoft spokesperson said the Nature paper was published a year after its submission, and the company has made \"tremendous progress\" in that time. Microsoft plans to share additional data \"in the coming weeks and months,\" the spokesperson added.\"Discourse and skepticism are all part of the scientific process,\" Microsoft's spokesperson said. \"That is why we are dedicated to the continued open publication of our research, so that everyone can build on what others have discovered and learned.\"Quantum timelinesAmazon and Microsoft also have differing views on the expected timeline for practical quantum usage.Microsoft's spokesperson told BI, \"Utility-scale quantum computers are just years away, not decades.\" Amazon's spokesperson, however, expects another couple of decades before mainstream adoption.\"While quantum computers may not be commercially viable for 10-20 years, bringing quantum computing to fruition is going to take an extraordinary effort, including sustained interest and investment across the industry starting now,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI.Chris Ballance, CEO of quantum-computing startup Oxford Ionics, told BI that Amazon's recent quantum chip announcement was equally vague with little substance. Other industry experts previously told BI that they were unsure if the technology has advanced as far as these companies claim.Still, Ballance said the recent array of quantum news is a \"good sign\" for the industry, which is still in its \"very early days.\"\"It shows that people are waking up to the value of quantum computing and the need to address it in their roadmaps,\" Ballance said.Have a tip?Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

Evidence of that came earlier this year when Microsoft made hundreds of performance-based cuts in January and February.In many ways, it's a blast from the past for Microsoft, which once had a reputation for conducting tough reviews. The arrival of Satya Nadella as CEO more than a decade ago changed that, with the company taking a softer stance. Some even called Microsoft a \"country club.\"Microsoft's current process for managing out low performers can take months of documentation. One high-level manager told Ashley the average time to exit a low performer after a manager notified HR was about seven months. That process can be further delayed if an employee takes a leave of absence, which can reset the clock.But with the AI race heating up, Microsoft wants to move faster and more efficiently. Like its peers Meta, Amazon, and Google, that's meant taking a deeper look at its performance review and management process.Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIMicrosoft's potential pivot also shows where AI's had the most impact thus far.Since ChatGPT's arrival a few years ago, there's been plenty of speculation about all the jobs that were at risk of being automated away by AI.The reality, though, is the tech isn't advanced enough to replace most roles completely. Efficiencies can be achieved that allow a company to cut some headcount, but AI hasn't completely wiped out jobs in most cases.In fact, the industry AI is disrupting the most is the one building it: tech.It's not just a matter of AI automating people's jobs. (Although those are looking dicey for software engineers.) The massive bets tech giants are making on AI are forcing them to recalibrate their entire operations to be as streamlined as possible, and those changes don't come easy.Perhaps the shift was always coming. The rise of interest rates and the maturation of these companies might have naturally led to a stage of buckling down.But spending billions on tech that hasn't fully panned out from a business perspective certainly didn't slow things down.News briefAlito says he's 'stunned' the Supreme Court ruled against Trump over USAID's funding.Outgoing Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen lost $11 million in bonus and stock payments when he resigned from the grocery chain.Trump told Congress that Musk runs DOGE — and the lawyers noticed.Instagram says it's 'doubling down' on DMs. This chart shows just how much.Add the teachers' union to the list of investors worried about Tesla's sliding stock.Media leaders tell BI how they're tackling a crisis that's bigger than Trump.Tripledot Studios in a $900 million deal, sources say.3 things in marketsALEX WROBLEWSKI/AFP via Getty Images1. Federal workers' layoff pains will be mostly invisible in Friday's jobs report. DOGE's February firings won't be reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report because of the cuts' timing. And even though the job losses will appear in a more distant report, they probably won't make a big dent overall.2. Are we on the verge of a \"Trumpcession\"? Wall Street exec Jeffrey Solomon is part of a small but growing group of forecasters using the dreaded R-word: recession. In an interview with CNBC, Solomon said a trade war could impact supply chains and prompt business leaders to pump the brakes on dealmaking. Some signs already point to an economic slowdown, and Solomon isn't alone in waving the red flag.3. Brevan Howard is telling investors the \"true risk\" is not getting in on crypto. For years, institutions have kept their distance from digital assets. Brevan Howard's CEO told BI the tipping point for institutional investors is on the horizon, thanks to the boost provided by President Trump and crypto czar David Sacks. The firm, whose digital assets unit was up more than 52% in 2024, wants to be the go-to place for crypto-curious institutions.3 things in techGetty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI1. Meta keeps \"block\" lists of ex-employees. Hiring managers at Meta sometimes pursue laid-off workers for rehire. They express interest, set up a screening call — and then ghost. That's because some ex-employees are on lists that deem them \"ineligible for rehire,\" even if they have a written track record of exceeding managers' expectations. BI's story elicited a reaction from former Google HR chief Laszlo Bock.2. Google Search is going AI Mode. The tech giant said it plans to test a new \"AI Mode\" feature for Search that aims to answer users' queries with \"a wider and more diverse\" set of AI-powered results. Instead of AI Overviews, which respond to queries with a direct answer at the top of the results page, the new AI Mode takes things a step further by generating an entire page.3. Big events for big ratings. TV networks have been struggling with maintaining their audiences for years. But BI's Peter Kafka picked up on a pattern to get more eyes: streaming must-watch live sports and awards shows. The most recent Oscars, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics got bumps in viewers, and streaming was part of their equation.3 things in businessMichelle Rohn for BI1. Meet the PR pitbull adored by Sam Altman and Bari Weiss. Lulu Cheng Meservey is one of Silicon Valley's most sought-after communications gurus, known for her unusually aggressive \"going direct\" strategy. Less enchanted are her PR peers, who aren't sold on her style of bucking convention, tweeting madly, and playing offense with the press. Still, Cheng Meservey won the admiration of startup founders by showing them how she thinks.2. A new DOGE staffer was connected to a fertility clinic and has ties to the pronatalist movement. Miles Collins, whose association with DOGE was first reported by BI, is a startup founder who employees say has been working at the Department of Labor. Collins was connected to a California fertility clinic that's now facing lawsuits accusing it of mistreating employees, although the company has denied wrongdoing. Collins is also the brother of a prominent pronatalist, a movement that Elon Musk has also spoken in favor of.3. A tariff breather for car companies. President Donald Trump is giving the Big Three automakers — Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors — a one-month pause on his recent tariffs to avoid an \"economic disadvantage.\" But there won't be another break when Trump's second round of trade-related tariffs takes effect on April 2, and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum are coming this month.In other newsA once-hot startup got a $1.5 billion loan.

        "description": "A leading UK competition watchdog has ended a formal investigation into the partnership of Microsoft and the makers of ChatGPT, OpenAI. The reasoning for such scrutiny was previously described as the software giant having material influence over OpenAI, but now it has ended the case by adding that they don’t control its operations. The sudden U-turn decision has surprised many. As per the CMA, Microsoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI in terms of finances with up to $13 billion being put on the company to see its success. It was said to acquire major influence over the firm in 2019, but didn’t have de facto control over this. Moreover, it didn’t meet the threshold for official inquiries.The news comes after expressions of disquiet over the addition of the previous boss of Amazon UK as the interim chair for the CMA. As per the company’s leading executive, Sarah Cardell, she also shared how the CMA doesn’t want to roll out a chilling effect on companies’ confidence amid the growing pressure coming from the British government on regulators to roll out growth proposals.So far, the CMA says that they found no change in control by Microsoft on OpenAI. Since it never happened, the collaboration doesn’t qualify for any kind of review or scrutiny under the UK’s merger control regime.However, this decision shouldn’t mean that they have a clean sheet in terms of concerns related to competition. After all, both companies are huge players in the tech world and to see them unite can mean big things.The CMA began investigating the partnership after news broke out of Sam Altman’s firing and then immediate reinstatement. At the time, Microsoft shared how it would hire Altman so that it could rejoin OpenAI again.Other points worth a mention are how the CMA investigation showed a dramatic drop in OpenAI’s reliance upon Microsoft for things like computer power that is quintessential for healthy AI business operations. Microsoft shared more on this matter, including how they were open to CMA’s scrutiny because they were only promoting competition and innovation on a healthy level. Last year, we saw the CMA take a similar stance in terms of dropping an investigation against Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and Microsoft’s collaborations with Mistral and Inflection.OpenAI has a non-profit board of directors but has a profitable subsidiary. This is where Microsoft happens to be the biggest backer with plenty of returns to investors. Given the growing influence of US tech giants and political dynamics, some speculate that pressure from American firms, possibly tied to Trump-era policies favoring deregulation, may have influenced UK regulators to ease scrutiny, ensuring competitive advantages for Microsoft and OpenAI in the global AI race.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Google Launches AI Mode on Search Labs for More Advanced Reasoning, Thinking, and Multimodal Capabilities",

        "description": "Microsoft; Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIMicrosoft cut nearly 2,000 employees deemed low performers this year.The cuts come as the company reevaluates its performance review process, people say.Microsoft had been notoriously tough in reviews, but took a softer stance under CEO Satya Nadella.In 2023, a Microsoft employee asked to take on a lighter workload when his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer.His managers were supportive, and appeared happy with his performance during his wife's illness as recently as late 2024 when they told him to expect 120% of his bonus.Then, on Jan. 22, the employee said, an HR representative unexpectedly joined his weekly manager meeting. The employee was then fired without severance, and was told his health insurance would expire that night.The employee's wife had to skip chemotherapy treatments for a month after.\"I'm still shocked,\" he told Business Insider in a recent interview. \"Shocked and angry. I did everything right.\"The Microsoft employee asked not to be identified to protect future career prospects. BI has verified his identity and confirmed details of his performance, termination, and his wife's illness, through documentation.Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw said performance-based terminations rarely come as a surprise to employees, and people can elect to have COBRA coverage.This person is one of nearly 2,000 fired by Microsoft in January and February in a culling of those deemed low performers, according to a person familiar with the cuts.This kind of performance-based mass cut is a shift for the tech giant, which continues to review the approach. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as the company considers changes to its performance review and management process, several people with knowledge of the plans said.\"We aspire to have a high-performance culture and want to make sure managers have the ability to drive that and that expectations are clear,\" Shaw said, adding that the company isn't trying to design a tougher system, but one that removes ambiguity, provides clarity and flexibility, and allows managers and teams to move with speed.A new way to evaluate employeesMustafa SuleymanLeon Neal/Getty ImagesMicrosoft's new approach to performance management is shaping up to be one of the biggest changes to Microsoft's management strategy since Satya Nadella became CEO more than a decade ago.Before he arrived in 2014, Microsoft had a reputation for a cutthroat performance-review system, at least in a tech industry that often mollycoddled talented employees. Nadella softened that considerably. Microsoft once had a reputation for a \"country club\" culture, as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called it, where employees go after they're done working hard in their careers and want to coast before retirement.Now, some leaders worry the company has gotten too soft, making it difficult to shed underperformers, according to the people familiar with Microsoft's plans.The company is looking to new external leaders, such as ex-Google executive Mustafa Suleyman and former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, along with existing executives like the company's senior leadership team and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, to help design a new way to evaluate employees, these people said.Microsoft has had an incredibly successful decade, becoming a leading cloud provider and AI player. It's worth about $3 trillion, making the software giant the third largest company by that measure. However, the stock has stagnated over the past year as questions mount about the company's Copilot technology, and AI competition intensifies.The broader tech industry is facing other challenges, and Microsoft is not immune. A decade-long hiring boom has fizzled as companies focus more on profit, and AI coding tools reduce competition for software engineering talent. Meta recently cut about 5% of its workforce to \"raise the bar on performance management.\" Amazon is culling managers. Even Google is trimming jobs.Microsoft's termination letterEmployees who were let go in Microsoft's recent round of performance cuts got termination letters explaining the abrupt exit.\"The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position,\" the letters, viewed by BI, stated. \"You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft.\"The letters mentioned severance but said medical, prescription, and dental benefits ended on the last day of employment. The letters also noted that Microsoft will consider past performance and termination if the person applies for other jobs at the company in the future.\"At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent,\" a company spokesperson told BI recently. \"We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.\"'Right to fire'Deena Merlen, a partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told BI her law firm has received more inquiries about performance-based layoffs as of late.\"Employers generally have the right to fire, just as an employee has the right to quit,\" she said. \"As long as Microsoft's alleged performance-based reasons are not for some other, unlawful reason, Microsoft is within its rights to engage in these layoffs.\"The company has no obligation to provide severance, but such agreements often come with a release of legal claims that can protect the company from lawsuits, Merlen added.Stack rankingBefore 2014, Microsoft previously used a controversial system to evaluate employee performance. Called stack ranking, it forced managers to put employees on a curve, and cut the lowest performers.At Microsoft, that meant managers had to rank employees from one to five, and someone always had to get the lowest score of a five, no matter how well they or the team performed. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said the system was especially problematic for small teams, and while terminating the lowest rung was not a companywide policy, it happened on some teams.Kathleen Hogan, chief people officer at MicrosoftMicrosoftStack ranking was unpopular internally and was seen as prioritizing individual work, pitting employees against each other and creating a barrier to collaboration. Developers and even entire organizations had a tendency to reject acceptable solutions to problems if they hadn't developed those solutions themselves, the company's chief people officer Kathleen Hogan previously told BI. There's even a famous cartoon depicting Microsoft's org chart as warring factions.'Model, coach, care'The company officially abandoned stack ranking just before Nadella took over as CEO early 2014. He redesigned the company's performance-review system around the \"growth mindset\" concept. The idea is skills are developed through hard work, and challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a \"fixed mindset,\" which assumes that talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure.Nadella and his new leadership team applied this growth mindset to a new framework called \"model, coach, care,\" which called on managers to set a positive example for employees, help staff adapt and learn, and invest in people's professional growth.Instead of ranking employees from one to five, Microsoft moved to a performance-review system that gives managers a simple payroll budget they could divide and dole out to employees based on performance.Kevin Oakes, CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, has worked with Microsoft on implementing a growth mindset. He told BI this approach is a way to encourage top performers, but noted that even companies like Microsoft need to cull their workforces to become leaner and higher performing.\"Any high-performing organization should make sure employees are performing at an acceptable level, and they should be weeding out people who are not performing at an acceptable level,\" he said. \"Over time, you tend to get a little bloated as a big company where you've let hiring go unchecked in some areas and need to get back to a lean, efficient machine.\"The ManageRewards sliderMicrosoft CFO Amy HoodStephen Brashear/Getty ImagesToday, employees are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 200 called the \"ManageRewards slider.\" The process begins with frontline managers, who evaluate an employee's impact and recommend where they think they should land on the slider. Then, another higher-level manager considers \"differentiation,\" i.e. making sure the team is distributed along the slider.The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140 and 200 are higher performers. Those ratings impact how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses. A score of \"Impact 60,\" for example, generally gives employees 0% of their stock award and 30% of their maximum cash bonuses while the slightly higher rating of \"Impact 80\" gives them 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said 100 is considered a good score and means an employee has met all of their objectives.In general, the company's senior leadership team gives managers a budget that allows for every employee on the team an average score of 109.\"So you want to pay someone impact 140 for doing an outstanding job? Find 3 people you're giving Impact 100 so it's affordable,\" one executive-level manager explained. \"Keep this guy around. He'll be paying for everyone's bonuses.\"The manager said they typically have paid top performers by finding a set of people who failed in the previous year and giving them all zero or reduced rewards. This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. \"That's a bad manager,\" Shaw said. \"You certainly can't give everybody high rewards,\" but you can give",

Microsoft introduced a new clinical artificial intelligence assistant Monday (March 3) that combines advanced voice dictation and ambient listening with generative AI to alleviate doctors’ workflow burdens. Called Dragon Copilot, the assistant integrates Microsoft’s Dragon Medical One (DMO) speech capabilities for doctor dictation of medical notes and its DAX Copilot ambient AI listening technology that converts conversations between doctors and patients into clinical summaries that can be integrated into the electronic health record, according to a press release. The consolidated AI tool aims to minimize clinician burnout by streamlining administrative tasks and bringing forth faster clinical insights, the release said. One of the top causes of physician burnout is not having enough support staff, according to the American Medical Association (AMA). When this happens, doctors are diverted into doing tasks that take them away from patients. Another cause happens when doctors are burdened by too many administrative tasks. The burnout rate stood at 45% in the first half of 2024, down from 56% in 2021, 53% in 2022 and 48% in 2023, the AMA said. “So, things are improving, but we have work to do,” AMA Vice President of Professional Satisfaction Dr. Christine Sinsky said. AI can help, Joe Petro, corporate vice president of health and life sciences solutions and platforms at Microsoft, said in the release. “At Microsoft, we have long believed that AI has the incredible potential to free clinicians from much of the administrative burden in healthcare and enable them to refocus on taking care of patients,” Petro said, per the release. Read also: AI Medical Tools Show Promise as Health Tech Markets Rally Dragon Copilot Faces Competition Microsoft’s DMO and DAX technologies came from the company’s $16 billion acquisition of Nuance Communications, which was finalized on March 4, 2022. The tech giant faces competition from upstarts. Abridge, a clinical documentation AI startup, raised $250 million in a Series D round last month. Meanwhile, Suki, an AI startup that streamlines administrative tasks for clinicians, raised $70 million in its own Series D round in October. Although it has rivals, Microsoft said in the release that Dragon Copilot offers more features than AI scribing, making it the “first unified voice AI experience to the market.” According to the release, Dragon Copilot also: Streamlines documentation with multilanguage note creation, automated tasks, personalized formatting, natural language dictation, speech memos, AI prompts and other features. Enables medical information searches from trusted sources for clinicians through the embedded AI assistant. Automates tasks such as clinical evidence summaries, referral letters, after-visit documentation and others. Among organizations already using DMO and DAX technologies separately, 70% of clinicians reported reduced feelings of burnout, 62% were less likely to consider leaving their organization, and 93% of patients reported a better overall experience, per the release. Microsoft built Dragon Copilot on a secure data foundation, incorporating healthcare-specific safeguards, the release said. The platform aligns with the company’s responsible AI principles, focusing on transparency, reliability, safety, fairness, inclusiveness, accountability, privacy and security. Dragon Copilot will be available in the United States and Canada in May, and subsequent launches are planned for Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, according to the release. Microsoft also plans to enter other key markets. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Microsoft says its Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits.MicrosoftMicrosoft, Amazon, and Google have recently announced prototypes of new quantum computing chips.Some physicists are skeptical that the field has advanced as much as the companies say.Scientists say the field remains dynamic and evolving, with hurdles to overcome before it's useful.The field of quantum computing has become increasingly prominent after recent announcements of new quantum chip prototypes from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Still, some industry insiders remain skeptical that the technology has advanced as far as the companies claim.Amazon Web Services on Thursday announced the Ocelot chip, a prototype the company said represents a breakthrough in error correction and scalability — two key issues that have long slowed advancement in the field.Amazon's announcement followed one from Microsoft on February 19 saying it had created a new state of matter to power its own new quantum chip prototype, the Majorana 1, in a development that would propel quantum computing forward.Google's Willow chip prototype debuted in December. The company said Willow could perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes — a task that would take the current fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, a timeframe that exceeds the age of the universe.The tech giants say their respective developments are massive advancements in the quantum computing field, which could eventually lead to major social advancements such as discovering new drugs, developing new chemical compounds, or breaking our current encryption methods.However, some computer scientists and physicists told Business Insider the field remains dynamic and evolving, with hurdles to overcome before quantum computing is useful.'The joke is, it's always 25 years away'Virginia Lorenz, a professor of atomic, molecular, and optical physics at the University of Illinois' Grainger College of Engineering, said there are still many technical roadblocks in the way of fully functional and commercially relevant quantum computing — meaning, quantum computers that do something useful for the average person, rather than just scientists.\"The joke is, it's always 25 years away,\" said Lorenz, who founded the first publicly available quantum network, which allows citizen scientists to experiment with the tech while visiting the Urbana Free Library. \"At least if you keep the current approaches, the problems are technical, and there are many of them, versus the situation being everyone trying different ways of solving one problem.\"Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of technology that relies on units of information called qubits rather than the binary bits used in classical computing. Qubits exist in multiple states at once and require specific conditions such as low light or extremely cold environments to replicate results reliably and without errors, which has made advancement in the field slow going.Researchers who spoke to BI agree that the two main roadblocks to advancing the quantum field lie in scalability and error correction. However, there is no consensus about how to approach, much less solve, either problem.In early February, Google told Reuters that the company plans to release commercial quantum computing applications within five years, despite skepticism from some industry insiders.A spokesperson for Google told Business Insider they're confident in their approach with Willow and the company's projected timeline for commercial quantum applications. However, they added that it's important to discern between what a company describes as a breakthrough and what the broader quantum community considers a breakthrough, highlighting the significance of the peer-review publication processes of scientific journals.While the tech giants have made some strides in showing progress on the error reduction and scalability issues using various approaches, quantum technology experts told BI they haven't come close to solving them.Troy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that each company's announcement represents another building block that the industry will use to create a functioning quantum computer rather than a solution in and of itself.\"There's lots of challenges ahead,\" Nelson said. For example, he said what Amazon gained in error correction with its Ocelot chip \"was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip.\"Rahul Mahajan, chief technology officer of the digital business transformation unit at Nagarro, a technological engineering and consulting firm, told BI the key to real advancement in quantum technology is not just about measuring or observing qubits' behavior, which the tech giants' recent papers largely focus on, but about reliably getting them to conduct the complex calculations they are capable of solving.\"One step is storing qubits and observing, the second is transformations,\" Mahajan said. \"As humans, we evolve; in chemistry, molecules evolve; nature evolves. So there are simulations now for us to do — controlled simulations — that's the next big, important stuff.\"These remaining hurdles have prompted high-profile skeptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to suggest we're still 20 years away from the technology being \"very useful.\" Even Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at AWS, told Business Insider when discussing the company's Ocelot chip debut that the 20-year timeframe is probably accurate.\"I think somewhere in between 10 and 20 years, I have some good confidence that we'll have practical, useful quantum computers in that timeframe,\" Painter said. \"But we also need to take a sort of humble and realistic approach to the work we have to do going forward.\"Previous retractions of researchMicrosoft-backed researchers have been wrong about quantum computing before.Two papers published in Nature by Microsoft-funded researchers in 2017 and 2018, which claimed to have created similar Majorana states as the company's latest announcement about its Majorana 1 chip, were later retracted.In Microsoft's latest Nature paper about its recent Majorana findings, a passage in its peer-review file suggests the journal's editorial was still skeptical of the company's claims.\"The editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices,\" the peer review file reads. \"The work is published for introducing a device architecture that might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.\"A Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has received some general questions about its methodology since its most recent Nature paper was released. They said that Microsoft has continued advancing its quantum approach since the paper was first submitted on March 5, 2024.\"Discourse and skepticism are all part of the scientific process,\" the spokesperson said. \"That is why we are dedicated to the continued open publication of our research, so that everyone can build on what others have discovered and learned.\"The spokesperson added, \"There is a lot of science to explain when it comes to quantum computing, and in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to sharing our results along with additional data behind the science that is turning our 20-plus-year vision for quantum computing into a tangible reality.\"A leading quantum physicist and CEO of a quantum software company told Business Insider that Microsoft's claim of inventing a new state of topological matter amounts to little more than marketing. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to prevent their skepticism of Microsoft's announcement from causing backlash on their own company; BI has verified their identity.\"It is an important distinction that there is no topological quantum computer today,\" the quantum physicist said.Still, the buzz around the advancement of quantum computing is a net positive for researchers, even if the announcements from the tech giants don't pan out scientifically, Lorenz, the physics professor, said.\"It's a bit of a self-feeding cycle since more funding means more interest, which means more capability and more promise, you know?\" Lorenz said. \"And I think that's a bit of why it's so suddenly in the public sphere and a major element as to why we're seeing so much news around it — because there's still a lot of work to be done to make a quantum computer that shows a definite advantage over classical computers, and actually fulfills some of the promises we've heard.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft says its Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits.MicrosoftMicrosoft, Amazon, and Google have recently announced prototypes of new quantum computing chips.Some physicists are skeptical that the field has advanced as much as the companies say.Scientists say the field remains dynamic and evolving, with hurdles to overcome before it's useful.The field of quantum computing has become increasingly prominent after recent announcements of new quantum chip prototypes from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Still, some industry insiders remain skeptical that the technology has advanced as far as the companies claim.Amazon Web Services on Thursday announced the Ocelot chip, a prototype the company said represents a breakthrough in error correction and scalability — two key issues that have long slowed advancement in the field.Amazon's announcement followed one from Microsoft on February 19 saying it had created a new state of matter to power its own new quantum chip prototype, the Majorana 1, in a development that would propel quantum computing forward.Google's Willow chip prototype debuted in Dece",

        "description": "Microsoft employees stream down a hallway by the dozen, smartphones and paper coffee cups in hand, many clad in heavy coats on this frigid February morning. The setting is idyllic—Lake Washington is in full view through floor-to-ceiling windows—but they stride purposefully. As they do, they pass a digital sign with a tersely worded call to action: All squads ship Competing/differentiating Growing work every sprint to double Successful Sessions ABS(Always Be Shipping) Despite the profusion of Microsofties on the premises, this isn’t Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond campus. Instead, these staffers have taken over a Hyatt hotel in Renton, another Seattle suburb. They work for a division known as Microsoft AI—MAI for short—and have traveled from corporate outposts as distant as the U.K., Switzerland, China, and India to attend a team off site. Mustafa Suleyman, MAI’s CEO, instituted these conclaves upon arriving at Microsoft just under a year ago—part of an unorthodox mass hiring in which the software behemoth absorbed most of the staff from Inflection AI, the startup Suleyman cofounded in 2022. The gatherings take place roughly once every seven weeks, and part of their purpose is unblinking self-assessment. Ahead of the meeting, around 80 squads of 6 to 15 people apiece have rated themselves on their success in hitting recent deadlines on a scale of red, amber, or green. The results aren’t great—but Suleyman sees that as progress in itself. “It’s taken a few cycles to get people to be basically honest in terms of their scoring,” he tells me shortly after presiding over the event’s keynote presentation. “And this time, there was lots of red—like almost 45% red. I think that was a really, really good moment; and we sort of stood up and owned it. I was very proud of the team.” Though being CEO of something called “Microsoft AI” sounds like a job of nearly unlimited purview, Suleyman does have a more specific remit. He’s charged with using AI to transform the company’s consumer properties, including the free Copilot chatbot app available on the web and in versions for Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android. The progress MAI measures in squad-size chunks all levels up to a much higher goal: building an AI companion that not only answers questions accurately but performs tasks based on a deep understanding of your needs. And not just an anodyne chatbot, but a warm and relatable persona you’ll enjoy spending time with. In its present form, Copilot has barely begun to hint at this wildly ambitious vision. But as Microsoft pushes forward, “You’ll start to see Copilot become a platform that enables a personalized AI companion for you,” promises Suleyman. “It’ll have its own name, have its own visual representation, have its own personality, and really be your sidekick. What we are building is your second brain, your aide, your consigliere, your reliable chief of staff in your pocket.” It’s lofty talk, but Suleyman—whose round, wire-frame glasses help give him the presence of a particularly glib owl—has a knack for explaining AI in a compelling fashion. His cautionary 2023 book on the subject, The Coming Wave, was a New York Times Best Seller; his 2024 TED talk, “What is an AI Anyway?” has been viewed 2.7 million times. More importantly, his bona fides include cofounding not just Inflection, but before that DeepMind in 2010. The London-based company made computing history when it created software that taught itself to play the famously complex Chinese board game, Go, better than any human. Then it developed an algorithm for predicting how proteins fold themselves, a transformative tool for drug discovery. Both of those landmark feats reached fruition after Google acquired DeepMind in 2014; Suleyman left DeepMind in 2019 and exited Google altogether in 2022, shortly before founding Inflecton. In 2023, Google merged the company with another AI arm, Google Brain, to form Google DeepMind, with Suleyman’s fellow cofounder Demis Hassabis as CEO. The combined operation is responsible for the Gemini large language model now used in many Google products, putting Suleyman in direct competition with his former colleagues. (Suleyman says he remains friendly with Hassabis, but argues that competition fuels creativity, noting that in February, he recruited the engineers responsible for one of Google’s best-received uses of AI: its uncanny “Audio Overview” synthetic podcasts.) In terms of raw users, Copilot has some catching up to do. According to data from intelligence company Similarweb, the consumer version—which is distinct from the one that’s part of the Microsoft 365 productivity suite—had a desktop and mobile web audience of just 15.6 million in January. That was far behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT (246 million), Chinese upstart DeepSeek (79.97 million), and Gemini (47.3 million), though ahead of Perplexity (10.6 million) and Anthropic’s Claude (8.2 million). This data doesn’t include people who use Microsoft’s free Copilot app, but market intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that ChatGPT currently has 30 times the monthly active users of consumer Copilot. Microsoft is not wholly dependent on Copilot to reach consumers. Bing, another part of Suleyman’s portfolio, may only have 4% of the search market to Google’s 90%, according to StatCounter, but with an audience of 174 million people in January, it’s larger than any AI bot except ChatGPT, per Similarweb. His group also oversees Microsoft’s Edge web browser, which comes bundled with Windows and could become a potent AI delivery system of its own. And over time, Suleyman’s AI companion vision might give Copilot more market traction by clearly differentiating it from ChatGPT. (The two products share many technical underpinnings thanks to the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership.) Still, the relative tininess of Copilot’s current user base shows that the vision of Microsoft’s signature consumer-AI effort has yet to transform into the kind of mass attention the company cares about. “For Copilot to be truly useful for you long term, it needs to not only be able to ingest all your long-form documents and your email and your calendar and your context, but it needs to not forget what you’ve talked about a couple of sessions ago. And we are getting really good at that now.” [Photo: Carlton Canary for Fast Company] Then again, it’s not like anyone else has truly figured out consumer AI. The industry’s often-clumsy stabs at it—such as Google’s gaffe-ridden AI Overviews and short-lived Meta bots personified by the likes of Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton—can feel like answers to questions nobody asked. “Every single company is trying to understand what the market wants at this point,” says Divya Kumar, Microsoft‘s general manager of search and AI marketing. “We’ve barely scratched the surface.” But Suleyman can’t depend on Microsoft’s rivals flailing forever; if MAI doesn’t create the first true AI consigliere, somebody else surely will. Hence, the intensity he brings to managing and motivating his team, a job he describes as “building the cultural flywheel that then builds the product.” That goal was apparent in a February email to his staff—written shortly after DeepSeek’s stunningly efficient LLM shocked the AI industry—in which Suleyman predicted more surprises ahead and called for a great hunkering down. “What MAI needs from everyone this year is extreme focus,” he wrote. “The competition will be unlike anything we’ve seen. This is for real. This is the time to do the best work of your lives.” The son of an English nurse mother and Syrian cab-driver father, Suleyman landed on AI as his life’s work not because he was in love with the technology for its own sake, but because he saw its potential to make the world a better place. At 19, he dropped out of the University of Oxford, where he studied philosophy and theology, to help start a telephone counseling service for Muslim youth. He then served as a human rights policy officer for London Mayor Ken Livingston and cofounded a consultancy dedicated to driving societal change on a global scale. Suleyman was only 25 when he and two friends, who had the training in computer science he lacked (Hassabis and Shane Legg), started DeepMind in 2010. The company was a bet on their conviction that evermore-powerful supercomputers would lead to an epoch-shifting moment when AI would surpass human cognitive ability across an array of disciplines. Legg called that phenomenon Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. Early on, their faith that AI‘s future would be extraordinary was so contrarian, Suleyman says, that “we never really talked openly about our ambition to build AGI—that was always something that we whispered in hushed tones to each other and among a very small group.” Eventually, though, the entire field adopted AGI as a concept—and a goal. DeepMind indeed made historic progress, putting Suleyman at the heart of the AI revolution just as it was taking off. But in a major career setback, he left DeepMind in 2019—reportedly not by choice but precipitated by complaints from employees that he had a bullying management style. In a 2022 podcast, he accepted the criticism—”I really screwed up”—and said that he’d since worked with an executive coach to become a better boss. By the end of his DeepMind tenure, Suleyman says, he was itching to get AI out of the lab and into the real world. Rather than leave Google altogether, he spent another two years at the company as VP of AI product management and AI policy. Among his responsibilities was working with the Google Brain team, which had developed an LLM called LaMDA. At the time, ChatGPT didn’t exist; even OpenAI‘s GPT LLM hadn’t proven itself capable of powering radically new AI experiences. LaMDA “was at GPT-3 level performance, at least a year",

        "description": "Technique uses a \"teacher\" LLM to train smaller AI systems. Leading artificial intelligence firms including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta are turning to a process called “distillation” in the global race to create AI models that are cheaper for consumers and businesses to adopt. The technique caught widespread attention after China’s DeepSeek used it to build powerful and efficient AI models based on open source systems released by competitors Meta and Alibaba. The breakthrough rocked confidence in Silicon Valley’s AI leadership, leading Wall Street investors to wipe billions of dollars of value from US Big Tech stocks. Through distillation, companies take a large language model—dubbed a “teacher” model—which generates the next likely word in a sentence. The teacher model generates data which then trains a smaller “student” model, helping to quickly transfer knowledge and predictions of the bigger model to the smaller one.Read full article Comments",
