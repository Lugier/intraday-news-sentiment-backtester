Date: 2025-06-06 20:34:13
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs lowering the rating on MYR Group, even if simultaneously raising the rating on MasTec, signals a potential negative outlook for companies in a similar sector.

Date: 2025-05-15 20:26:51
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the news mentions a Goldman Sachs Managing Director, the core content pertains to Walmart and potential price increases due to tariffs. This has no direct and immediate impact on GS's revenue, costs or operations in the next 60 minutes. The mention of Goldman Sachs is superficial, negating any significant short-term price reaction.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sees AI Investment Boosting Structured Finance
Date: 2025-05-15 16:00:00
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news suggests increased demand for structured finance due to AI investment. This directly benefits GS, as a major player in structured finance, potentially increasing revenue in that area. The positive sentiment surrounding AI, coupled with increased demand for financial services, is likely to trigger short-term buying pressure.
```

Title: Goldman Sachs Sees Limited Room for Asian IG Spreads Tightening
Date: 2025-05-15 06:15:55
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news suggests Goldman Sachs' analysis of Asian IG spreads, indicating their view that tightening is limited. While it might affect trading strategy in that region, it doesn't directly impact GS's financials, operations, or market share in the immediate term. The news lacks quantifiable data and surprise factor to trigger a significant price movement within the next 60 minutes.
```

Title: Goldman, BMO Cut Out Private Credit in $4 Billion Alera Deal
Date: 2025-05-14 23:10:28
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs is involved in a $4 billion financing deal, which directly impacts its revenue stream. The fact that Alera Group chose Wall Street lenders *including* Goldman Sachs suggests confidence in traditional banking and provides immediate deal-making revenue. This is a positive signal for short-term traders, likely triggering buying pressure in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Britain’s post-Trussmatic stress
Date: 2025-05-14 19:10:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news suggests Goldman Sachs is heavily involved in the UK gilts crisis ("grasps the long, spiky tail"). While the phrase is somewhat ambiguous, short-term traders will likely interpret this as GS being potentially negatively impacted by the crisis, possibly incurring losses or facing increased scrutiny. This negative sentiment will likely trigger immediate selling pressure.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bank Strategists Grow More Bullish on Credit as Trade Fears Ease
Date: 2025-05-14 18:50:46
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news directly mentions Goldman Sachs (GS) and suggests that their analysts are now more optimistic about corporate debt markets due to easing trade fears. This positive shift in outlook from GS analysts, combined with the catalyst of easing trade fears, is likely to create short-term buying pressure as traders react positively to the improved sentiment.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Morgan Stanley Hires Goldman’s Metals and Mining Head
Date: 2025-05-14 18:21:58
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The loss of a global head in a key sector (metals and mining) to a direct competitor (Morgan Stanley) reflects negatively on GS's talent retention and perceived strength in that area. While not directly quantifiable, the surprise factor and potential sentiment trigger related to competitive disadvantage will likely lead to a minor, short-term price decrease.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Trump's preferred price for oil is between $40-$50 based on his social media posts
Date: 2025-05-14 18:02:10
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news lacks a direct causal link to Goldman Sachs' immediate revenue or costs. While GS conducted the analysis, the core information relates to Trump's oil price preferences. This is unlikely to significantly move GS's price within 60 minutes, as it doesn't represent a material shift in their operations or market outlook.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs analysts read through more than 1,000 of Trump's social media posts. They found a key takeaway about how he talks about oil.
Date: 2025-05-14 11:20:34
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news focuses on Goldman Sachs analysts analyzing Trump's social media posts related to oil prices. While the analysis itself is from GS, there's no direct impact on GS's revenue, costs, or operations, and the market likely already expects GS to be involved in such analyses. Therefore, there will be no significant price movement within the next 60 minutes.
```

Date: 2025-05-14 11:14:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news title suggests an article about investment strategy from Goldman Sachs, not necessarily news directly impacting GS itself. While the description mentions diversification, the article doesn't provide specific information affecting GS's financials or operations. The information is generic and unlikely to trigger a significant price movement in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Yuan Is Set to Gain Versus Dollar, Goldman Sachs Says
Date: 2025-05-14 11:10:39
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Goldman Sachs' view on the Yuan's appreciation may be interesting to the FX market, it has no direct, immediate impact on GS's revenue, costs, or operations. The news is unlikely to trigger significant buying or selling pressure on GS stock within the next 60 minutes as it's not a core business driver or surprise announcement related to GS's own financial performance.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Says Trump Favors $40-$50 Oil After Scrutinizing Posts
Date: 2025-05-14 04:11:47
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news presents an analysis by Goldman Sachs, not a material event directly impacting its financials or operations. The claim regarding Trump's preference is derived from social media analysis, which is not a quantifiable catalyst for immediate trading action. This analysis is unlikely to drive significant short-term price movement in GS stock within the next 60 minutes.
```

Title: Valero raised to Buy at Goldman, reflecting improved margins and cash returns
Date: 2025-05-13 20:41:59
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news concerns Valero, not Goldman Sachs (GS). While Goldman's analyst rating might indirectly affect GS's reputation as an analyst firm, the impact on GS's stock price within the next 60 minutes is negligible. No direct impact on GS's revenue, costs, or operations is identified.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs raises growth forecast and lowers recession odds
Date: 2025-05-13 19:10:49
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: This news directly impacts GS's perceived financial health and future prospects. Raising the growth forecast and lowering recession odds are positive indicators, likely triggering short-term trader optimism and buying pressure. The magnitude of the change in outlook presents a significant positive surprise, supporting an immediate price increase within the 60-minute window.
```

Date: 2025-05-13 19:10:15
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses a former Goldman Sachs banker taking a role in Canada's resource sector. While the banker's background at GS is mentioned, the event itself has no direct or quantifiable impact on Goldman Sachs' current revenue, operations, or immediate market position. Thus, there is low confidence this news will meaningfully affect GS's stock price in the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs said in talks for Irish launch of its retail banking unit
Date: 2025-05-13 19:06:35
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news of Goldman Sachs potentially launching a retail banking unit in Ireland suggests expansion and increased revenue opportunities. This represents a positive, although potentially small, surprise factor that could generate short-term buying pressure as traders anticipate future growth. The direct impact on GS's operations, while not immediately quantifiable, is likely perceived positively, driving a small upward price movement within the 60-minute window.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman in Talks to Expand Its Marcus Retail Bank Into Ireland
Date: 2025-05-13 18:16:03
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While expansion into Ireland is potentially positive long-term, the news focuses on "talks" and "could," indicating uncertainty and lack of immediate financial impact within the 60-minute window. The expansion is not a surprise catalyst and the direct impact is likely minimal within such a short timeframe as its an ongoing discussion.
```

Title: We Will Continue to See The Consumer Spend Says Nancy Tengler
Date: 2025-05-13 17:45:12
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news mentions Goldman Sachs (GS) raising its year-end targets for the S&P 500, citing improved trade negotiations. This positive outlook from a significant player like GS could create short-term positive sentiment and potentially drive the stock price slightly upward within the next 60 minutes due to increased investor confidence.
```

Title: Carney Stacks Cabinet With Ex-Goldman Banker, Quebec Loyalist
Date: 2025-05-13 16:57:03
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news details cabinet appointments in Canada, including a former Goldman Sachs banker. While the appointment of an ex-GS employee might be tangentially relevant, it has no direct impact on GS's financials, operations, or market share within the next 60 minutes. The magnitude of this appointment isn't significant enough to cause immediate price movement, and it's unlikely to trigger immediate widespread trading sentiment.
```

Title: Dallas-based Bestow, which offers underwriting and insurance software to carriers, raised a $120M Series D led by Goldman Sachs and Smith Point Capital (Mary Ann Azevedo/TechCrunch)
Date: 2025-05-13 15:05:01
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: GS led a $120M Series D funding round for Bestow. While not a massive deal for GS, leading a funding round is generally viewed positively as it suggests GS's investment arm sees potential in the company. In the very short term, this association, especially being the lead investor, should be a minor positive catalyst.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Insurtech Bestow lands $120M Series D from Goldman Sachs, Smith Point Capital
Date: 2025-05-13 14:45:00
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs leading a $120M Series D funding round for Bestow signals confidence in the insurtech company. This positive endorsement and investment, while not directly increasing GS's revenue immediately, boosts its reputation and can generate positive sentiment towards GS as a savvy investor within the next 60 minutes, potentially leading to a short-term price increase.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman, JPMorgan Lift China Growth Outlook on US Tariff Truce
Date: 2025-05-13 13:16:41
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs lifting China's growth outlook is positive for GS. The news, while not a direct earnings beat, suggests a stronger global economy, boosting confidence in GS's international operations and potential deal flow. This surprise lift, directly referencing GS's name, should trigger short-term buying sentiment.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The bulls are back in town. Goldman and this Wall Street optimist are lifting their S&P 500 targets on tariff relief.
Date: 2025-05-13 12:55:00
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news that Goldman Sachs is lifting its S&P 500 target following tariff relief is likely to create positive short-term sentiment. As a leading financial institution, GS's outlook and strategy adjustments are influential, and this bullish signal acts as a catalyst for short-term traders, driving buying pressure in the immediate window. This positive sentiment trigger will likely outweigh other factors within the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-05-13 10:45:01
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news highlights Goldman Sachs' proactive adoption of AI, with potential for efficiency gains (up to 20% reported by some engineers). This positive narrative around innovation and productivity improvement, especially highlighted by the CEO, could generate short-term positive sentiment and drive up the stock price in the immediate trading window. The deployment of AI tools across the workforce indicates a serious investment with likely positive returns in the future.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Raises S&P 500 Targets on Lower Tariff, Recession Risks
Date: 2025-05-13 05:35:37
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news of Goldman Sachs raising S&P 500 targets, coupled with easing trade tensions, acts as a positive catalyst. While an S&P 500 target increase doesn't directly impact Goldman's revenue, the "Buy America" trade comeback sentiment, especially coming *from* Goldman itself, will likely trigger short-term bullish sentiment and potentially spur buying activity in the financial sector within the 60-minute window.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Anheuser-Busch lands bull rating from Goldman Sachs after U.S. market share gains, balance sheet moves
Date: 2025-05-12 20:05:59
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news involves Goldman Sachs issuing a "bull" rating for Anheuser-Busch. While positive for Anheuser-Busch, the direct impact on GS within the next 60 minutes is minimal. This is a common occurrence, with analyst ratings having limited immediate causal influence on the analyst firm's stock price.
```

Title: US dollar expected to decline against major Asian currencies – Goldman Sachs
Date: 2025-05-12 18:25:28
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses Goldman Sachs' expectation of a USD decline against Asian currencies.

Title: Goldman Sees Yuan Reaching 7 Per Dollar as Trade Talks Progress
Date: 2025-05-12 05:19:57

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman to Wind Down ETF Accelerator, Shift Servicing to Tidal
Date: 2025-05-09 22:17:18
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Winding down the ETF Accelerator platform, while transferring servicing, signals a contraction or strategic shift away from a previously active area. The $5 billion AUM figure suggests a potentially meaningful impact, even if the servicing transfer mitigates some revenue loss. Short-term traders may interpret this as a retreat from a growth area, triggering a slight sell-off.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Hires Staffers From Goldman, Davis Polk and BPI
Date: 2025-05-09 21:21:05
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news of Fed Governor Bowman hiring staffers from Goldman Sachs doesn't directly impact GS's revenue, costs, or operations in a quantifiable way within the next 60 minutes. While the connection to Goldman might be perceived positively by some, the hiring process itself is unlikely to trigger immediate, significant price movement. The news lacks a clear catalyst or quantifiable data to warrant a positive or negative classification.
```

Title: Trump keeps talking about unilateral ‘deals.’ Some tariffs may go up, Goldman economist warns.
Date: 2025-05-09 13:10:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of potential tariff increases, highlighted by Goldman's chief political economist, introduces uncertainty and potential economic slowdown. While not directly impacting GS revenue immediately, increased trade tensions are generally negative for financial institutions due to reduced global activity and market instability. This surprise negative development will likely trigger immediate, albeit possibly small, downward pressure as traders react to the increased risk.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Trump may reintroduce higher tariffs on other countries, cautions Goldman
Date: 2025-05-09 13:01:23
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news suggests potential economic disruption from renewed tariffs, indirectly impacting Goldman Sachs through potential market volatility and decreased deal-making activity. While Goldman may only be cautioning on the tariffs, the association with negative economic consequences and Trump's potential actions will likely trigger a negative reaction in the short term from many traders.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Stocks are at a risk of a drop of nearly 20%, says Goldman Sachs. Here’s the trigger.
Date: 2025-05-09 12:53:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of Goldman Sachs forecasting a potential drop in the S&P 500 implies a negative outlook for the overall market. While GS is providing the forecast, the association with potential market decline is likely to trigger negative sentiment among traders in the short term, potentially leading to immediate selling pressure on GS stock itself. This creates a negative sentiment trigger influencing short term price action.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Stocks climb on trade optimism. Here's why Boeing and Goldman are having especially strong days
Date: 2025-05-08 20:17:16
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The title explicitly states "Goldman are having especially strong days" due to "trade optimism." This suggests positive momentum specifically impacting GS, likely leading to increased buying pressure in the short term. The context of an "actionable afternoon update just in time for the last hour of trading" further amplifies the potential for immediate positive price movement within the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The Fed will still cut 2-3 times, but later in the year – Goldman’s Rosner
Date: 2025-05-08 19:35:05
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news indicates that the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut rates, albeit later in the year than previously anticipated. While this is an update to the outlook, the announcement isn't a surprise, so the immediate impact on GS's price within the next 60 minutes should be minimal. There's no identifiable catalyst for significant movement, and the information seems already factored into existing market expectations.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Boeing, Disney and Goldman Sachs lead way as Dow runs day’s gain to 625 points
Date: 2025-05-08 18:46:38
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news highlights GS as a leader in a significant market rally, likely creating positive short-term sentiment and FOMO buying within the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-05-08 15:55:04
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news indicates Goldman Sachs (GS) is working on a £1bn sale, suggesting fee revenue generation. This is a direct, positive impact on GS's revenue stream within the next 60 minutes, even if the details of the transaction are not known at this time.

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: An $80 Billion UAE Firm Is Wooing Trump and Luring Wall Street
Date: 2025-05-08 14:30:26
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news indicates potential new business opportunities for Goldman Sachs (GS) by courting a large, rapidly growing firm in Abu Dhabi. The description highlights GS among other "Wall Street giants," suggesting a competitive advantage. This increased deal flow and potential for revenue growth in the immediate future likely prompts short-term buying pressure on GS shares.
```

Title: Carlyle earnings signal buyout pioneer is returning to growth
Date: 2025-05-08 12:09:58
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Carlyle's earnings and Harvey Schwartz's comments are generally positive for the financial sector, they lack a direct, quantifiable impact on Goldman Sachs specifically within the next 60 minutes. The news doesn't contain specific data points (e.g., deals, revenue figures) directly relevant to GS, and the rate cut speculation is already widely anticipated, minimizing the surprise factor. Therefore, it's unlikely to trigger a significant price movement in GS within such a short timeframe.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Carlyle Makes Gains by Pushing Beyond Private Equity Buyouts
Date: 2025-05-08 12:01:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news focuses on Carlyle Group, not Goldman Sachs. While the description mentions a "tough moment for markets," this is too general to directly impact GS's price within 60 minutes. No direct impact on GS's revenue, costs, operations, or market share is apparent, making any immediate price movement unlikely.

Date: 2025-05-07 23:37:41
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Goldman is issuing the forecast, there is no direct impact identified on GS's revenue or operations. The news relates to broader macroeconomic trends (inflation, dollar value), which are often already priced in to some extent. While some traders might react, the surprise factor is likely not significant enough to cause a strong, sustained directional move in GS's price within the next 60 minutes based solely on this news.
```

Title: Millennium in Talks With Goldman’s Petershill About Stake Sale
Date: 2025-05-07 22:41:05
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news describes Petershill (a GS unit) assisting Millennium in finding buyers for a minority stake. While indirectly related to GS, this activity is a routine part of Petershill's business and is unlikely to have a significant, immediate impact on GS's overall revenue or market sentiment in the next 60 minutes. The magnitude of a stake sale is unknown and provides no quantifiable data suggesting a positive or negative move.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Millennium in talks with Goldman’ Petershill about stake sale
Date: 2025-05-07 21:10:30
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Millennium considering a stake sale with Goldman's Petershill involved indicates potential increased valuation and investor interest in Goldman's portfolio company. This news is likely to be interpreted favorably by short-term traders, driving demand and causing a slight price increase within the 60-minute window due to FOMO buying.
```

Title: Corporate bond liquidity ‘has never been better’ – Goldman’s Jonny Fine
Date: 2025-05-07 17:44:33
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs stating that corporate bond liquidity is good is likely to be perceived positively. This perception is likely to drive short-term bullish sentiment as it implies healthy market conditions. It suggests a stable environment for Goldman's trading and investment banking operations, thus triggering immediate, albeit small, buying pressure.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Market pros say stocks are already pricing in a US trade war victory — even without news of any deals
Date: 2025-05-07 16:46:42
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the article mentions Goldman Sachs' strategist's opinion, the overall message is mixed, suggesting potential over-optimism in the market regarding trade war outcomes. The lack of concrete updates and conflicting expert opinions create ambiguity, thus it is unlikely to cause a significant price movement in GS stock within the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Thinking of buying silver? Gold is probably still going to do better, Goldman Sachs says.
Date: 2025-05-06 10:42:42
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses Goldman Sachs' view on gold versus silver. While it mentions Goldman Sachs, the subject matter is about precious metals and does not directly impact GS's core financial performance or operations within the next 60 minutes. The content is more of a market commentary than a catalyst for immediate trading action on GS stock.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sees Buy-the-Dip Opportunity in AI After Big Tech Earnings
Date: 2025-05-05 21:27:09
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: This news is POSITIVE because Goldman Sachs is explicitly stating a "buy-the-dip opportunity" within the AI sector, suggesting confidence in its continued growth. This positive signal, coming directly from Goldman Sachs analysts, could trigger immediate buying pressure on GS stock due to increased investor confidence and association with a growth area, creating a short-term price increase within the next 60 minutes.

Title: Systematic Funds to Buy Stocks No Matter Which Way Market Swings
Date: 2025-05-05 20:50:34
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news indicates increased buying pressure in US stocks, which is a positive signal for the overall market and, by association, for Goldman Sachs (GS), a major player in the market. The mention of Goldman Sachs directly following "commodity trading advisors are once again surfacing as buyers of US stocks" suggests a possible connection, implying that GS stands to benefit from this increased activity, thus creating a positive trigger within the 60-minute timeframe.
```

Title: How Carlyle Is Navigating the US Trade War
Date: 2025-05-05 19:36:02

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: Citi restarting lending is competitive pressure, but not a significant surprise or immediate threat to GS's market share within 60 minutes.

However, this specific news item is about a "Bloomberg Markets" segment which features a GS analyst.

Date: 2025-04-30 00:56:30
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs saying "oil demand looks resilient" is a positive catalyst.

However, the description primarily outlines the topics and guests of a Bloomberg Markets segment, including a GS Healthcare Analyst.

Date: 2025-04-23 16:49:13
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news highlights significant investor disapproval regarding executive compensation.

Date: 2025-04-23 13:00:48
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news highlights GS's strategic shift and strong performance ("rallied 31% this year to a fresh record high").

Date: 2025-04-11 06:30:08
Sentiment: negative

Date: 2025-04-10 18:16:47
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs' analysis indicating that the tariff pause won't prevent further stock market declines creates a negative sentiment trigger, suggesting GS itself anticipates market weakness.

Date: 2025-04-10 11:39:42

While GS isn't directly an oil producer, the negative oil price forecast by GS, a highly influential financial institution, creates immediate uncertainty and potential downside risk across the energy sector and market sentiment in general.

Date: 2025-04-10 00:37:18
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs initially predicted a recession due to tariffs but quickly retracted that prediction after Trump paused tariffs.

Date: 2025-04-09 21:24:38

Date: 2025-04-09 20:43:24
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs rescinding a recession call is a positive signal, as it reduces perceived economic risk. The tariff pause, the reason for the rescission, reduces a major economic headwind that would directly impact GS's investment banking and trading revenues, leading to a likely immediate positive market reaction within the 60-minute window.

Date: 2025-04-09 19:49:41

While GS is issuing the prediction and not directly affected by recession to the same extent as others, this projection creates broad market uncertainty and fear.

Explanation: A cut to a year-end Treasury forecast, while relevant to Goldman Sachs' broader economic outlook, lacks a direct and immediate impact on its revenue or operations within the next 60 minutes. The news is likely already factored into market expectations, and its impact will likely unfold over a longer period. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant price movement within our short 60-minute timeframe.

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The headline mentions Goldman executive pay, but without specific figures or context (e.g., unexpectedly high bonuses, significant layoffs related to pay), it lacks immediate price impact within 60 minutes.

Explanation: The news focuses on criticism of Goldman Sachs' bonus payouts to top executives. While the actual financial impact on the company within 60 minutes is likely negligible, the negative publicity and potential backlash from shareholders and the public can lead to immediate negative sentiment among traders and a slight price decrease as a knee-jerk reaction.

Date: 2025-04-01 10:42:11

Date: 2025-03-31 16:12:06
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news directly mentions Goldman Sachs cutting the S&P 500 target due to higher tariffs and slowing growth.

Date: 2025-03-31 15:58:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs cutting its S&P 500 target, and raising its recession forecast is likely to cause immediate negative sentiment.

Title: Goldman Slashes S&P 500 Target for Second Time on Growth Risk
Date: 2025-03-31 08:58:34
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs cutting the S&P 500 target, citing recession risk and tariff uncertainty, is likely to trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders. Although the news is about GS's strategists making a prediction, the fact that it's *another* cut signals heightened concern about the market, potentially leading to immediate selling pressure on GS as well. This news acts as a known negative catalyst (recession fears).
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Stocks, Futures Drop as Tariff Concern Mounts
Date: 2025-03-31 07:42:18
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news highlights "sinking feeling in the markets" due to rising tariff concerns.

Date: 2025-03-31 03:47:37

Title: Goldman Sees More Fed Cuts This Year as Tariffs Dent US Growth
Date: 2025-03-31 01:54:14
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While Goldman Sachs issuing this forecast is not directly negative for their own operations, the core message implies weakening US economic growth driven by tariffs, which indirectly hurts the financial sector, including GS. Short-term traders will likely interpret this as a sign of potential future headwinds for GS, triggering a slight sell-off. This sentiment has a high surprise factor, making a short-term price decrease likely.

Date: 2025-03-29 21:54:50
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news reports that Glass Lewis is urging investors to reject $80M in bonuses for the CEO and president, which can be interpreted as negative sentiment towards GS leadership. This could trigger immediate selling pressure as some investors react negatively to the perceived governance issues, resulting in a short-term price decrease. The relatively high bonus amount suggests a notable level of concern among investors that may want to see compensation tied more closely to performance.

Title: Goldman Executive Bonuses Slammed as ‘Excessive’ by Glass Lewis
Date: 2025-03-29 19:30:24

Title: Glass Lewis criticises Goldman’s ‘egregious’ executive bonuses
Date: 2025-03-29 17:41:42
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news directly concerns executive compensation, a highly sensitive topic for shareholders. The "egregious" label and the size of the awards ($80mn) create a negative sentiment trigger. Although it's just a recommendation by Glass Lewis, the strong wording combined with the potential for shareholder rejection is likely to create immediate selling pressure, causing a short-term price decrease.

Date: 2025-03-28 02:45:26

Explanation: This news describes Goldman Sachs analysts changing their RBA rate cut forecast. While the adjustment might reflect Goldman Sachs' macroeconomic views, it doesn't directly affect GS's revenues, costs, or operations (no direct impact identified).

Title: Goldman Increases Gold Forecast to $3,300 an Ounce by Year-End
Date: 2025-03-27 01:55:22
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Goldman Sachs increasing its gold forecast is noteworthy, it's unlikely to significantly impact GS's stock price in the next 60 minutes. The news doesn't directly affect GS's core revenue streams or operations; it's an analyst opinion on a commodity price, not a fundamental change in GS's business.

While a $685 million deal suggests a positive transaction for GS, the information doesn't specify the financial gain or impact to GS, or if it was expected.

Date: 2025-03-26 08:55:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses Goldman Sachs' approach to integrating company culture into AI agents, which is an abstract concept.

Date: 2025-03-25 10:55:43

Explanation: The news discusses potential implications of tariffs and ECB rate cuts, but the connection to GS's immediate revenue or profitability is tenuous. Although Jari Stehn is a Goldman Sachs economist, his comments are about macroeconomic conditions, not GS-specific business.

Title: Goldman Sachs continues seven straight sessions of gains
Date: 2025-03-24 21:30:15
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: A headline stating "Goldman Sachs continues seven straight sessions of gains" suggests positive momentum.

Title: Goldman’s Nachmann Sees More Regulator Focus on Private Credit
Date: 2025-03-24 03:00:37
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news suggests increased regulatory scrutiny on Goldman Sachs' private credit operations.

Date: 2025-03-21 18:31:24

Date: 2025-03-21 16:00:06

Date: 2025-03-20 06:00:13
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title mentions "Goldman's next king?" which is speculative and lacks immediate financial impact for GS in the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-03-19 21:46:54
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news of Goldman Sachs being selected for the Verisure IPO is a positive catalyst. This represents a direct impact on GS's revenue through investment banking fees, and the potential size of the IPO ("one of the largest listings in Europe") suggests a significant, positive impact on near-term earnings sentiment. This could trigger immediate buying from algorithms and traders reacting to the win.
```

Title: Everyone Wants Debt, Not Equity
Date: 2025-03-19 19:30:25
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title "Everyone Wants Debt, Not Equity" doesn't directly affect GS's immediate revenue or operations. While Goldman Sachs succession is mentioned, it's within a broader context and lacks the specificity needed to trigger significant immediate price movement.

Date: 2025-03-19 13:37:41
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news title explicitly states "Goldman, Jefferies Cut as Oppenheimer Says M&A Rebound in Doubt." This creates a negative sentiment trigger for short-term traders, suggesting a slowdown in M&A activity, which is a significant revenue driver for Goldman Sachs. While Jefferies is also mentioned, the direct consequence for GS being cut in conjunction with M&A doubts will likely lead to a brief sell-off within the 60-minute window.

Date: 2025-03-19 11:00:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The article mentions potential job cuts at Goldman Sachs, but it's framed within a broader discussion of leadership transitions. While job cuts are generally negative, the article's focus on emotional intelligence and mitigating negative effects suggests the impact is already being managed or is anticipated. This lessens the surprise factor and immediate negative reaction.
```

Date: 2025-03-19 06:00:37
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news implies potential leadership instability at GS, which is usually viewed negatively by the market in the short term.

Date: 2025-03-18 18:03:59
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news highlights an optimistic outlook on European M&A from Goldman Sachs bankers, suggesting increased deal flow and associated fees for GS. While not quantifiable, this positive sentiment directly from GS leadership serves as a short-term catalyst that could trigger immediate buying pressure, especially given the news title's explicit mention of Goldman. The expectation of increased M&A activity within Europe from the leadership within Goldman Sachs gives a positive indication of near term revenue for the GS investment banking division.

Date: 2025-03-18 16:34:52

Title: 'Mag 7' Has Become the 'Maleficent 7,' Kostin Says
Date: 2025-03-18 16:09:17
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news is negative for GS for the immediate term because the Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist publicly downgraded the S&P 500 year-end target. While not directly impacting GS's financials, the downgrade from a prominent figure at GS will likely create short-term negative sentiment among investors, leading to a potential selloff, particularly in GS's own stock, out of perceived lack of confidence.

While it might be valuable content, it doesn't present immediate quantifiable data, direct impact on revenue, or a significant surprise factor that would cause a significant price movement within the next 60 minutes. The lack of a catalyst and focus on a general program means the impact is likely negligible in the short term.

Date: 2025-03-17 12:30:15
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs cutting oil price forecasts, as highlighted in the news, reflects a potentially weaker outlook for the energy sector.

Title: UBS hikes gold forecast to $3,200 on trade risks; Goldman cuts oil price view
Date: 2025-03-17 11:03:11
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news contains both a positive (UBS gold forecast) and a negative (Goldman oil price view) element. Neither of these directly impacts GS's revenue streams in a way that would be felt within the next 60 minutes, as these are just analyst forecasts, not concrete business outcomes for GS. The lack of a direct, immediate impact on GS operations suggests minimal price movement directly attributable to this news within our short time horizon.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Lowers Oil Forecast on Slower Demand, Higher Supply
Date: 2025-03-17 10:59:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: This news is likely negative for GS in the short term. While GS isn't directly an oil producer, lowering oil forecasts reflects a negative economic outlook, potentially impacting GS's investment banking and trading divisions due to reduced market activity and risk appetite. Traders may interpret this as a sign of potential headwinds for the financial sector, leading to short-term selling pressure on GS.

Title: The market’s at a fork in the road, says RBC as it becomes third firm to cut S&P 500 forecasts.
Date: 2025-03-17 10:22:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: This news is negative for GS in the immediate short-term because it highlights a trend of analysts cutting S&P 500 forecasts, specifically mentioning Goldman Sachs (GS). While GS initiated one of these cuts, further cuts from other firms reinforce a bearish outlook, which could trigger immediate selling pressure in GS, given the perceived macro negativity. The mention of GS cutting the forecast makes this specific news incrementally negative compared to just another firm cutting the forecast.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Turmoil in the US is boosting global markets — but the chaos could still spread, Goldman Sachs warns
Date: 2025-03-17 07:55:27
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news highlights a potential US economic slowdown and recession risk, even though Goldman Sachs analysts mention some positive movement elsewhere.

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Cuts Oil Price Forecasts on Slow US Growth, OPEC+ Policy
Date: 2025-03-17 00:50:44
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Goldman Sachs cutting its oil price forecast is newsworthy, it's unlikely to cause a significant price movement in GS stock within the next 60 minutes. The news doesn't directly affect GS's revenues, costs, operations, or market share, and the impact on GS from its oil forecast being cut would be considered too indirectly linked to trigger immediate and substantial trading action.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs offers its newest option for downside protection in volatile markets
Date: 2025-03-15 16:18:49
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The launch of a new buffer ETF by Goldman Sachs Asset Management is unlikely to significantly impact GS's stock price within the next 60 minutes. This is a routine business activity and does not represent a major, unexpected event with direct, quantifiable implications for GS's immediate financials. While potentially positive for long-term revenue, the announcement itself lacks the surprise or magnitude necessary for a significant short-term price movement.
```

Date: 2025-03-14 19:05:34
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title "Wouldn't Buy Dip At These Levels" from Goldman Sachs' Karoui suggests a bearish outlook.

```

Title: Goldman pay surges 30% for handful of top executives
Date: 2025-03-14 17:43:56
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news highlights a 30% pay surge for top executives while overall employee remuneration increased more modestly. This could be interpreted negatively in the short term by some traders who see it as excessive compensation at the expense of shareholder value or other employees, creating a potential for immediate selling pressure. While not directly affecting revenue, the surprise factor and potential for negative sentiment make a price decrease within 60 minutes more likely.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sees Stronger China Construction Activity Aiding Steel
Date: 2025-03-14 05:30:32
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news indicates Goldman Sachs sees a positive trend (stronger China construction) benefitting steel, which, while not directly impactful on GS revenue, enhances GS's reputation as a source of market insight, leading to short-term positive sentiment. The "Goldman Sees Stronger China Construction" title will likely trigger immediate positive buying pressure based on name recognition and association with market expertise within the next 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Why Alternative Manager Stocks Are Suffering
Date: 2025-03-13 18:40:09
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news highlights concerns about rising earnings risks for Capital Markets sensitive earnings streams, according to Goldman Sachs' own analyst. While the news is about alternative asset managers generally, the mention of a GS analyst raising concerns acts as a negative signal for GS in the short term, triggering immediate selling pressure. The association to "rising earnings risks" creates a negative sentiment catalyst in the immediate trading window.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: An S&P correction exceeding 10% will inflict pain on global stocks, Goldman says
Date: 2025-03-13 15:57:28
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: This news, stating a potential significant S&P correction, is likely to induce short-term fear and risk-off behavior in the market. Since GS's performance is heavily tied to overall market sentiment and its exposure to global stocks, the immediate reaction within 60 minutes will likely be negative as traders reduce exposure to financial stocks anticipating the described correction.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Another strategist chops his S&P 500 target — but for a different reason than the Goldman Sachs reduction
Date: 2025-03-13 11:31:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news mentions a strategist lowering the S&P 500 target, similar to Goldman Sachs. While it reflects market uncertainty (stagflation concerns), it doesn't directly impact GS's specific revenue, operations, or immediate market share; therefore, the surprise factor for GS is low, suggesting no significant price movement within 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news is a mixed bag of CEO opinions on Trump's policies. While Solomon expresses optimism and engagement, there's also mention of CEO frustrations and uncertainty regarding tariffs.

Date: 2025-03-13 10:00:17
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: "Hedge Funds Calling In Asia Bets" suggests reduced trading activity and potentially lower revenues for GS's Asia operations within the next 60 minutes.

Title: Hedge Funds Shift to Unwind Positions in Asia, Goldman Says
Date: 2025-03-13 06:55:46
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news describes hedge fund activity reported by Goldman Sachs. While it mentions GS, the information is about broader market trends (unwinding positions in Asia) and doesn't directly impact GS's financials, operations, or market share in the next 60 minutes. The sentiment is already Wednesday, so any initial surprise would likely have already been priced in.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Blackstone and Goldman CEOs back Trump as tariffs fuel US recession fears

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news of Goldman CEO backing Trump, while potentially significant politically, has no immediate, quantifiable impact on GS's revenue, costs, or operations within the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-03-12 16:53:06
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs cutting its S&P 500 target and citing tariff-related uncertainties will likely trigger negative sentiment in the short term.

Title: Tariffs Hit Wall Street S&P 500 Targets
Date: 2025-03-12 16:38:54
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: GS cutting its S&P 500 price target is a negative signal, indicating concerns about reduced GDP growth, higher tariffs, and increased uncertainty. The "first major Wall Street Bank" aspect enhances the surprise factor and amplifies the potential for a negative market reaction in the immediate short-term, likely triggering selling pressure on GS stock.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs lowers its S&P 500 target, citing uncertainty, tariffs, and the Mag-7
Date: 2025-03-12 14:54:26
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs lowering its S&P 500 target suggests concerns about the broader market and economy, which are directly relevant to GS's investment banking and trading activities. While it is a target for S&P500 rather than GS stock directly, the reference to uncertainty, tariffs, and the Mag-7 is perceived negative, and may trigger an immediate negative reaction from traders worried about GS's performance in a potentially weakening market over the next 60 minutes. This sentiment, triggered by a well-known institution, will likely cause a temporary dip.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman’s Solomon Says US CEOs Want Policy Certainty From Trump
Date: 2025-03-12 13:37:54
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news discusses Solomon's desire for policy certainty.

Date: 2025-03-12 13:00:01

While Goldman Sachs is mentioned, the article does not present any company-specific negative news or specific quantifiable data points directly impacting GS's immediate financials or operations within the next 60 minutes. Therefore, the impact on GS's stock price in the short term is expected to be negligible.

Title: Goldman Sachs flinches and lowers its S&P 500 target. The mechanics are the interesting part.
Date: 2025-03-12 11:50:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news title explicitly states "Goldman Sachs flinches and lowers its S&P 500 target." This implies a lack of confidence in the market, which can trigger negative sentiment among short-term traders, leading to selling pressure on GS shares in the next 60 minutes. Lowering the S&P 500 target, even if it concerns the broader market, reflects negatively on GS's market outlook and potential trading revenue.
```

Title: Commodity Roundup: Copper futures up 1%, Goldman Sachs anticipates rise in U.S. copper net imports
Date: 2025-03-12 11:20:21
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Goldman Sachs anticipating a rise in US copper net imports is a positive signal for the commodities market. GS's anticipation lends credibility, potentially driving short-term buying pressure as traders anticipate increased demand and higher prices for copper, benefiting firms exposed to that market. This is a positive signal given GS is publicly stating and likely has data supporting the statement.
```

Title: Shaky US Stocks Will Be Swayed by Inflation Print in All Cases
Date: 2025-03-12 11:02:40
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news highlights the impact of upcoming inflation data on the broader stock market and mentions GS as one of the firms that anticipates a strong impact.

Title: Skepticism for US Stocks Deepens as Goldman Cuts S&P 500 Target
Date: 2025-03-12 04:57:40
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: This news is likely negative for GS in the next 60 minutes. Although GS is issuing the report, the title highlights "Skepticism" and Goldman cutting targets, signaling a negative outlook on the S&P 500. Short-term traders may interpret this as a signal to reduce exposure to equities, leading to an immediate, albeit potentially brief, sell-off of GS shares.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs Says US Credit Spreads Will Get a Lot Wider
Date: 2025-03-12 01:36:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Goldman Sachs predicting wider US credit spreads and highlighting tariff risks and potential economic weakness carries a negative sentiment trigger. This is due to the perception that GS's own analysis points toward increased risk and potential economic slowdown, which will likely cause investors to pull back on GS stock in the short term. The fact that the news comes *from* Goldman Sachs itself adds weight and immediate credibility in the eyes of short-term traders, causing a likely knee-jerk reaction.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman's Scott Rubner said to land at Citadel Securities' institutional derivatives arm
Date: 2025-03-11 17:35:41
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: A senior employee (Scott Rubner) leaving GS for a competitor (Citadel) is likely already factored into GS's market performance or will have minimal immediate impact. There's no direct quantifiable negative impact on revenue or operations within the next 60 minutes, and the market's reaction to personnel changes is typically muted unless at the C-suite level. Therefore, the news has a low probability of triggering significant price movement in the immediate short term.

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While GS is listed as one of the tickers, this news primarily concerns Couche Tard and Seven & i.

Title: More Volatility to Come, Goldman's Oppenheimer Says
Date: 2025-03-11 09:42:43
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Oppenheimer's view of "more volatility to come" and the expectation that the market correction has "a little bit further to go" will likely trigger short-term selling pressure, especially given his role as Goldman Sach's Chief Global Equity Strategist. This negative outlook, amplified by his influential position, creates a negative sentiment catalyst that could cause a drop in GS's stock price within the next 60 minutes as traders react to the perceived increased risk.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Goldman Sachs’ Scott Rubner Leaves Bank After Nearly 10 Years
Date: 2025-03-10 23:19:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The departure of a managing director, while noteworthy, doesn't present an immediate, quantifiable impact on GS's revenue or operations within the next 60 minutes. While the individual may be a key player, this type of personnel change is not a significant surprise catalyst that would drive short-term price movement. The impact, if any, is more likely to be felt over a longer time frame.

Explanation: Cutting the U.S. GDP view, especially when attributed to a potential negative factor like Trump's trade policy, is likely to be perceived negatively by short-term traders. While GDP isn't directly GS's revenue, it influences market sentiment and expectations of GS's business performance. This lowered outlook can trigger immediate selling pressure as investors react to the perceived economic slowdown.

Date: 2025-03-10 15:53:41

Explanation: While the article mentions Goldman Sachs' positive outlook on Chinese equities, it does not contain any direct or surprising information about GS's own financial performance or operations.

Date: 2025-03-10 06:30:28
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Mark Carney's past association with Goldman Sachs is mentioned, his election as the leader of Canada's Liberal Party and potential role as Prime Minister has no immediate, direct impact on GS's revenue, operations, or market share.

Title: Goldman Downgrades Indonesian Assets Amid Fiscal Risks
Date: 2025-03-10 02:17:04
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: While the news doesn't directly impact GS revenue, it's a downgrade of assets by GS itself.

Date: 2025-03-07 18:10:01
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news item highlights Goldman Sachs' positive view on certain AI software stocks, but also acknowledges a downturn in other AI-related sectors. While GS's perspective might influence investor sentiment, the overall impact is ambiguous within the 60-minute timeframe, as it's more of a general industry outlook rather than a direct catalyst for GS's stock price movement.

Title: Goldman Traders Say Stock Rally Hinges on Knife-Edge Jobs Data
Date: 2025-03-07 11:59:01
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news describes Goldman Sachs' trading desk's *prediction* about the market's reaction to jobs data, not actual data or a direct action by GS. The impact relies on an external factor (jobs data release) and market sentiment, so the direct influence of *this news itself* on GS's price in the next 60 minutes is uncertain, qualifying it as neutral.

Date: 2025-03-06 23:38:58
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Cost-cutting measures, while beneficial long-term, often create short-term uncertainty and negative sentiment as they involve layoffs and restructuring.

Date: 2025-03-06 15:00:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Gary Cohn's past role at Goldman Sachs is notable, his joining the board of an insurance tech firm (not directly related to GS) has no direct impact on GS's revenue, costs, or operations.

Title: Goldman Sees Faster German Growth on Fiscal Push, Fewer ECB Cuts
Date: 2025-03-06 01:15:56
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While Goldman Sachs making an economic forecast is within their purview, this news doesn't directly impact GS's own financials or operations in the immediate short-term. The surprise factor is low, as economic forecasts are common. Traders may see this as indirectly positive, but the link is too tenuous for a significant price movement in the next 60 minutes.

Title: There Was a Texas Lottery Arbitrage
Date: 2025-03-05 18:40:06
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news item mentions "Goldman's vice presidents" alongside unrelated topics like the Texas Lottery and 23andMe. This suggests a brief, potentially inconsequential mention.

Title: JPMorgan, Goldman, others offering more Russia-linked trades - report
Date: 2025-03-05 15:08:58
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Offering more Russia-linked trades carries significant reputational and regulatory risk for GS, which is likely to trigger immediate negative sentiment among traders.

Title: Goldman, JPMorgan Among Banks Offering More Russia-Linked Trades
Date: 2025-03-05 13:49:30
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: This news has negative implications for GS within the next 60 minutes. The implication of facilitating trades in Russian-related assets could generate immediate negative sentiment due to potential regulatory scrutiny and reputational risks for GS, triggering a likely sell-off as traders react to the news. This represents a direct operational risk, and the negative press associated with these activities carries a higher than usual surprise factor.

Title: Goldman Sachs scores sole adviser role in $19B port deal - report
Date: 2025-03-05 13:44:21
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: Securing a sole advisor role in a $19B deal directly impacts GS's revenue through advisory fees, representing a significant, immediate, and quantifiable positive catalyst. The sheer magnitude of the deal and sole advisor status will likely trigger short-term positive sentiment and FOMO buying within the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-03-05 12:00:00

Date: 2025-03-04 23:54:39
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news of Goldman Sachs conducting layoffs, specifically targeting vice presidents, generates negative sentiment in the short term. While cost-cutting is generally positive long-term, the immediate reaction is likely concern about morale and potential disruption. The 3-5% layoff figure, while not explicitly stated as a target, suggests a substantial reduction, reinforcing the negative immediate impact.
```

Title: Report: Goldman Sachs to Reduce Staff by Up to 5% in Annual Review
Date: 2025-03-04 23:48:34
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: A 3-5% staff reduction, while described as an annual review, suggests potential cost-cutting measures due to concerns about future performance, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Although the article mentions positive earnings results, the job cuts news are more immediate and tangible, and represent a larger reduction than previous reviews, thus creating a negative surprise and triggering concern in the immediate short term.

This is generally perceived positively by the market in the short term as it implies improved efficiency and profitability, potentially leading to a slight increase in GS's stock price within the next 60 minutes.

Title: Goldman's next round of annual layoffs will target vice presidents - report
Date: 2025-03-04 20:20:07
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: Layoffs, even targeted at VPs, generally create short-term uncertainty and negative sentiment. While cost-cutting is typically viewed positively long-term, the immediate reaction in the next 60 minutes is likely to be negative due to potential disruption and the perception of underlying issues driving the layoffs. This outweighs any potential positive sentiment from cost reduction in the immediate term.

Date: 2025-03-04 16:52:55

Title: Goldman Sachs CEO: Trump wants to 'level the playing field' with tariifs, US recession has 'small, but not zero' chance
Date: 2025-03-04 11:13:10
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The statement about a "small, but not zero" chance of a US recession will likely trigger immediate negative sentiment. While the CEO frames it as small, the mere mention of recession concerns creates uncertainty and is likely to spur a brief sell-off reaction in the next 60 minutes as traders react to the potential downside. The tariff discussion adds further uncertainty, though less immediate than the recession comment.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: 2025 the Year for Humanoid Robots: Agility Robotics CEO
Date: 2025-03-04 09:14:05
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the news mentions a Goldman Sachs projection, it's regarding the future market for humanoid robots ($38 billion by 2035), which has no immediate, direct impact on GS's revenue or operations within the next 60 minutes. The news focuses on Agility Robotics and the general humanoid robot market, making it a tangential reference to GS, therefore having minimal likelihood of a significant price reaction.

Date: 2025-03-04 01:45:40
