        "description": "US households are expected to scoop up a total of $425 billion in stocks this year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesAmericans are snapping up huge volumes of stock via their retirement accounts, Goldman Sachs says.The TINA trade—which stands for There is No Alternative to stocks—is alive and well, Goldman said. Strategists said they believed hot demand for stocks could help drive the S&P 500 to fresh highs.For US households, there's still no alternative to the stock market. The TINA trade in stocks — which stands for There Is No Alternative — was thought to be waning in recent years as rising interest rates since 2022 boosted bond yields for the first time in years, giving investors another option to lock in steady returns. However, TINA appears to be back in full swing, and the impulse is particularly strong in US retirement accounts like 401(k)s, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a recent note. Strategists at the bank pointed to red-hot demand for stocks in US retirement accounts, with total 401(k) allocations to equities in the US swelling to $8.9 trillion in 2024. In 2022, 71% of 401(k) assets were allocated to stocks, up from 66% in 2013. Among account owners in their 20s, the allocation is even higher, with the average investor allocating 90% of their portfolio to stocks, the bank found.401(k) participants in their 20s had an average 90% allocation to stocks in their retirement accounts in 2022.ICI, EBRI, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchRetail traders, meanwhile, have snapped up around a net $20 billion in stocks over the last three months, according to estimates from Goldman's trading desk.Retail traders purchased a net $20 billion worth of stocks over the last 3-month period.GS FICC & Equities, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchAltogether, roaring demand from retirement accounts and retail brokerage accounts paints a healthy backdrop for the stock market. US household demand is a key pillar of strength for the market, the bank said. US households have raised their total stock allocation to 49% in recent years, the highest level on record, and the bank said it expects households to directly purchase $425 billion in equities this year.US households now allocate 49% of their financial assets to stocks.Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThose are signs that the TINA trade is in full swing, a major bullish catalyst for stocks, strategists said\"TINA trade remains alive and well in US retirement accounts,\" a team of strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note on Friday. \"We believe that persistent household equity demand and high allocations to equities will continue to support elevated equity valuations.However, the bank also notes that the top 10% of households by wealth represent 87% of household equity ownership, meaning demand is being driven by a relatively small slice of the population. The analysts added that an even smaller group—the top 1%—has been the primary driver of equity demand in the last 30 years. The bank anticipates the S&P 500 rising to a record high of 6,500 over the next 12 months, implying 7% upside from the index's current levels.Goldman strategists expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 over the next 12 months.FactSet, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchGoldman recently lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 6,100. Previously, the bank slashed its target for the index to account for the impact of tariffs, but has since lifted its economic outlook amid the easing trade tensions and progress on negotiations.

        "description": "Ray Dalio, Ken Rogoff, and Niall Ferguson are among those who are worried about a potential meltdown. Douglas Rissing/Getty ImagesTop experts are sounding the alarm about a potential debt crisis, Goldman Sachs said.The bank interviewed three economy pros about their outlook for the US fiscal situation.The top insights from Ray Dalio, Ken Rogoff, and Niall Ferguson are detailed below.Investor concerns over a swelling government debt load were soothed last week. But some experts say the US isn't out of the woods yet.Goldman Sachs spoke to three top economic experts — Ray Dalio, Ken Rogoff, and Niall Ferguson — about rising debt levels in the US. All three said they were worried about an impending debt crisis, particularly when considering the effects of President Donald Trump's GOP tax and spending bill, which has been estimated to add trillions to the budget deficit over the next decade.That reflects a slightly more pessimistic view than the market. After a scare last month, demand for long-dated government bonds was strong this week. It was a sign that investors are feeling more comfortable about the fiscal situation in the US, after showing nerves last month after Moody's downgraded US debt and Trump's tax bill began making its way through Congress.Here are the top points each of the experts had to make:Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates founderRay DalioJemal Countess/Getty Images for TIMEThe billionaire hedge fund manager said he sees three factors determining the outlook for the US debt. How much the government pays on debt interest relative to its revenue. If interest payments keep rising, it can \"unacceptably\" prevent the government from spending money on other things.How much debt the government needs to sell relative to demand. If the government needs to sell more Treasurys than people are willing to buy, interest rates will have to rise. That provides a more attractive yield to investors to hold onto the US debt, but high rates also hurt markets and the economy.How much money the central bank needs to print in other to purchase the remaining debt. If demand for US Treasurys is especially weak, the Fed can step in to purchase bonds to keep the government funded. If it has to print more money to do so, that can raise inflation and ding the value of the US dollar.\"One can easily measure these signs of deterioration and see movement toward an impending debt crisis,\" Dalio, who has long warned of troubling debt dynamics in the US, said. \"Such a crisis occurs when the constriction of debt-financed spending happens, like a debt-induced economic heart attack.\"To prevent a crisis, Dalio said he believed the government should reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP. Reducing the debt could cause interest rates to decline around 150 basis points, he estimated, reducing interest payments on the national debt and stimulating the economy.Ken Rogoff, Harvard professor and former IMF chief economistKenneth RogoffFaruk Pinjo/World Economic ForumGiven Trump's current agenda, Rogoff thinks the US will likely enter a debt crisis within the next four to five years. That's faster than the five- to seven-year timeline he predicted prior to Trump's reelection.\"The notion that debt is a free lunch that had been pushed by many economy-watchers is absurd,\" Rogoff said. \"Today's larger deficit on top of already-high debt levels is setting up for a crisis that will necessitate a significant adjustment.\"Rogoff thinks a debt crisis could play out in two ways:Inflation spikes and results in an economic shock. \"Exactly what that shock will look like is difficult to say, but it will likely be more painful than the Covid inflation shock that precipitated only relatively minor adjustments in bond markets,\" Rogoff said.The government could manage the debt by keeping interest rates artificially low and restricting capital flows. But those measures will hurt economic growth and essentially serve as a tax on savers in the economy, he said.Investors have long been concerned about the US debt, but the outlook is especially worrying now because long-term interest rates are going through a \"normalization\" from low levels that stretched over the past decade, Rogoff said.\"People need to recognize that higher interest rates are here to stay and that a return to the low-rate era of the past might well prove wishful thinking,\" he added.Niall Ferguson, historian and Harvard researcherNiall FergusonDavid Levenson/Getty ImagesFerguson thinks a crisis could be triggered by a military challenge that results in the US losing its position as a global power, as it goes deeper into debt.The British-American financial historian said his favorite gauge to determine how unsustainable national debt was is when a country spends more on interest payments for its debt than on defense.That rule, which he calls \"Ferguson's Law,\" now applies to the US, which spent $1.1 trillion on interest payments on the national debt over the 2024 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department. It was more than the $883.7 billion approved that year for total defense spending.Nearly every nation that has violated Ferguson's Law has lost its status as \" great power\" in financial markets, he said.\"Any great power that pursues a reckless fiscal policy by allowing the cost of its debt to exceed the cost of its armed services is opening itself up to challenge,\" Ferguson said. \"The US is just the latest great power to find itself in this fiscal jam.\"The US has been able to borrow as much as it has through now with no issues, in part because the US dollar remains the world's reserve currency and investors still see Treasurys as \"risk-free,\" Ferguson said, meaning they have faith in the US's ability to make good on its interest payments.But that already appears to be shifting, he said, pointing to investors around the world shedding their exposure to US Treasurys and moving away from dollar assets.\"I've warned the US is on an unsustainable fiscal path for 20 years now, and so at times have felt like the boy who cried 'wolf,'\" Ferguson added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "(L to R) Nicole Pullen Ross, Shane Cote, and Anna Kouba.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs welcomed about 2,600 interns with a letter of advice from CEO David Solomon.BI spoke to three former Goldman interns to ask what they wish they'd known starting out.We spoke to partner Nicole Pullen Ross, vice president Shane Cote, and associate Anna Kouba.About 2,600 students around the world just kicked off their internships at Goldman Sachs, including 1,000 who gathered at the firm's Manhattan headquarters for orientation.For many of these students, this will be one of the most consequential summers of their lives. Wall Street internships are hard to get, and how they perform could determine the course of their careers, including whether they get an offer to work for Goldman after graduation.Goldman's chief executive, David Solomon, welcomed the 2025 class with a letter offering his advice to the interns, as BI previously reported. BI also sat down with three Goldman employees who started as interns themselves to ask what they wished they'd known when they were starting out.David Solomon, Chairman and CEO, Goldman Sachs, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty ImagesWe heard from a partner in asset and wealth management with about 25 years of experience, but also young professionals who were interns not long ago, like Anna Kouba, a sales and trading associate, and Shane Cote, a vice president in the firm's investment bank.Their advice ran the gamut, from finding a balance between hard work and socializing to demonstrating the right attitude and humility in the pursuit of knowledge. Here's what they said interns should do to stand out and increase their chances of landing a full-time job.Anna Kouba, associate, FICC and Equities2019 summer analystAnna KoubaGoldman SachsKouba recalls a period of adjustment when she was an intern in 2019.\"I came here from Missouri, so I was not used to the culture of New York, the culture of working on Wall Street,\" she said.A few weeks into the internship, a senior leader who was also from the Midwest, reached out for a coffee chat. To her surprise, he wanted to know how the transition to big city life was going.\"He sat down and he asked, 'How are you doing? Because I know the transition from the Midwest to New York can be difficult.' I remember that and thought it was so unique to have such a big community here. I really felt like I was home even though I wasn't home.\"The sales and trading interns at Goldman split their summer into three \"rotations,\" allowing them to experience working on different teams in the division. Kouba started on the rates trading desk, and the Fed had just cut rates for the first time in 10 years.\"I felt so lucky to get to experience such a monumental day in the markets during my internship,\" she said. \"Sitting on the floor talking to the rates traders on that day about how they were talking to clients, I learned so much.\"Her biggest tip for interns is something she says can't be taught: \"A positive attitude and an eagerness to learn.\"Taking full advantage of the opportunities given here and showing that you are a hard worker — I think that is unmatched when it comes to somebody who is a successful intern,\" Kouba said.She also ranked fresh ideas and the courage to speak up about them high on her list of qualities she looks for in an intern.\"Interns are coming in and they are seeing all of these processes and projects that have been in place for years — and they're seeing them with fresh eyes,\" she said. \"So speaking up and questioning why things are done a certain way and giving their own perspective, I think, is where I've seen interns add quite a bit of value from day one.\"In the same vein, Solomon told interns to both \"ask and listen\" in his letter. \"You'll quickly learn that our people are eager to hear your views. I encourage you to stay curious, ask questions, but don't forget to also listen to and absorb your colleagues' perspectives.\"Shane Cote, vice president, Investment Banking2015 summer analystShane CoteGoldman SachsDuring his internship a decade ago, Cote was in the financing group of the investment bank — a time he looks back on \"with a lot of fondness.\"\"I loved the experience of working on the banking floor — the atmosphere, the continuous buzz of groups working collaboratively, and it really did feel like we were part of a sports team,\" he told BI.Today, he works as a VP on the healthcare coverage team. His advice to the 2025 class:\"Run at every opportunity you can and raise your hand to get involved with as many things as you can,\" he said. \"The interns that take advantage of every opportunity will not only be the most successful, but I think they're also going to get the most out of the program.\"He also advises interns to find a balance between working hard and participating in the many social opportunities the program has to offer.\"The internship really is only a handful of weeks, so you should work really hard, but your cultural fit within the firm and the group is important as well. So I would say take the time to step off the desk to network with your peers and colleagues,\" he said, adding: \"Get coffee with mentors and group leadership, go to group events — because a large part of this job really is about communication and emotional intelligence. Those are really great opportunities to be able to put those skills on display.\"He advised interns to be bold in asking for coffee meetings — even from senior employees.\"We have what we call a 'coffee culture,' where it's totally normal and expected, frankly, for you to make that ask — all the way up to group heads,\" he said, adding, \"They're very willing to do that kind of thing,\" he said. \"It's important for your development and I think it shows well as well.\"The CEO's memo offers a parallel piece of advice: to \"engage with purpose,\" telling the class to \"participate in team meetings\" and \"contribute your ideas.\"When it comes to work, Cote advised interns to meet their deadlines versus trying to come up with ways to stand out.\"From my perspective, it's about doing the thing you're asked to do very well,\" he said. \"I think the best interns are the ones that you can trust. As a VP, if I have an intern and he or she says she's going to do something, and they do it on time and correctly, that's really the ideal candidate.\"Nicole Pullen Ross, partner, Asset & Wealth Management1998 summer associateNicole Ross PullenGoldman SachsPullen Ross was a summer associate in private wealth management at Goldman in the late 1990s while pursuing her MBA at Columbia Business School.\"You come into an organization like Goldman and you feel intimidated because of the reputation and the brand,\" she said. \"But one of my first impressions was, 'Oh my God, I am welcome here.' And there is a lot to learn and a lot that people want to teach.\"Today, she helps welcome the summer interns on behalf of her division, leads round-table discussions with them, and introduces them to businesses she helps run, including private wealth management and the firm's sports and entertainment business.Pullen Ross is head of the bank's private wealth management business for the Northeast region and leads the PWM Sports and Entertainment Solutions offering, a money management service for athletes, entertainers, and team owners.\"We're looking for leaders, which means we're looking for people who are confident in sharing their perspective and asking questions,\" Pullen Ross said. \"And we're really looking for folks who have a great attitude: They want to roll up their sleeves, they want to solve problems for our clients. They're oriented around teamwork, and they're there to help.\"Solomon also brought up the importance of teamwork in his letter to interns. \"It's good to work hard as an individual, but it's even better to deliver results as a group. Here at Goldman Sachs, we have a \"we\" culture,\" he said.Standing out is not about demonstrating you know more than your peers, Pullen Ross added. It's important for interns to \"know what they don't know,\" she said.\"Be okay sharing, 'I don't know the answer, but I'll find out,'\" she said. \"That's the definition of the program, to get experience and to challenge yourself to not only acknowledge when you don't know something, but to have the focus on finding the answer when you are in a new place or new space that you're not familiar with.\"Read the original article on Business Insider (L to R) Nicole Pullen Ross, Shane Cote, and Anna Kouba.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs welcomed about 2,600 interns with a letter of advice from CEO David Solomon.BI spoke to three former Goldman interns to ask what they wish they'd known starting out.We spoke to partner Nicole Pullen Ross, vice president Shane Cote, and associate Anna Kouba.About 2,600 students around the world just kicked off their internships at Goldman Sachs, including 1,000 who gathered at the firm's Manhattan headquarters for orientation.For many of these students, this will be one of the most consequential summers of their lives.

The program is part of the president's signature — and controversial — spending bill, which has passed the House but faces headwinds in the Senate after getting publicly bashed by Elon Musk.The CEOs who attended the roundtable included Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.A White House official confirmed to Business Insider ahead of the event that under the program, the executives would announce plans to invest billions of dollars worth of collective investments into Trump Accounts for their employees' future children. With the exception of Dell, it was not immediately clear how much each company plans to invest if the initiative becomes law, and the companies did not specify when contacted by BI.Dell said in a statement provided to BI that the company would match the government's $1,000 investment for the children of its employees.\"The creation of investment accounts for every child will compound into substantial nest eggs providing support for education, home ownership, and starting families,\" the CEO said.Other corporate leaders who attended the event on Monday afternoon included Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev, Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris, Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner, Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas, and ServiceNow CEO William McDermott.\"This is a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation, and they'll really be getting a big jump on life,\" Trump said during his prepared remarks at the start of the roundtable.Trump Accounts would be available to every American citizen born from January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, according to the bill.

        "description": "Sara Wechter is the chief human resources officer at Citi.Courtesy of CitiCiti is giving hybrid employees two weeks of remote work in August.This move contrasts with norms at Wall Street firms like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.Citi's hybrid model aims to attract talent, offering a competitive edge over traditional banks.Citi CEO Jane Fraser is doubling down on work from home at a time when more companies — from Wall Street to Silicon Valley — are demanding employees return to the office five days a week.Citigroup on Monday announced two weeks of fully remote work in August for its hybrid employees, the majority of whom are required to be in the office at least three days a week.In a memo to employees on Monday, Citi's chief human resources officer, Sara Wechter, said the perk is a testament to the success of the bank's hybrid approach. \"Our hybrid work model helps us attract and retain top talent and sets us apart from other companies in our industry — and we remain committed to this model,\" the memo said.The policy does not apply to employees in non-hybrid roles — such as bank branch workers or jobs that require workers to be on-site for regulatory reasons. Employees taking up the offer must also choose work from a location where they have the legal right to work, meaning this is not a \"work from anywhere\" program.The bank, which employs 230,000 people around the globe, rolled out its hybrid work model following the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, banks like JPMorgan Chase have reversed their hybrid work policies, demanding that employees from front- and back-office roles return to their desks five days a week.Citi has offered a similar two-week remote work option in December every year since 2022, but the last time it offered this perk during the summer was in August of 2022.Fraser and her executive team have long framed hybrid work as a competitive advantage for luring talent. The 57-year-old CEO has even shared her own story about flexibile work, saying it enabled her to remain in the workforce as a mom while also serving as a partner at the consulting firm McKinsey in the early 2000s.JPMorgan Chase has mandated five days in the office, a move that's helped fuel the rise of a nascent union drive.

Employees taking up the offer must also choose work from a location where they have the legal right to work, meaning this is not a \"work from anywhere\" program.The bank, which employs 230,000 people around the globe, rolled out its hybrid work model following the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, banks like JPMorgan Chase have reversed their hybrid work policies, demanding that employees from front- and back-office roles return to their desks five days a week.Citi has offered a similar two-week remote work option in December every year since 2022, but the last time it offered this perk during the summer was in August of 2022.Fraser and her executive team have long framed hybrid work as a competitive advantage for luring talent. The 57-year-old CEO has even shared her own story about flexibile work, saying it enabled her to remain in the workforce as a mom while also serving as a partner at the consulting firm McKinsey in the early 2000s.JPMorgan Chase has mandated five days in the office, a move that's helped fuel the rise of a nascent union drive.

        "description": "Goldman Sachs analysts led by Steven Kron share the firm's latest conviction list, which includes 23 of the bank's top picks across sectors. Associated PressGoldman Sachs just released its best stock ideas list for June.The bank expects several names in the banking, energy, and tech space to be big winners.These 23 stocks are the top picks among Goldman Sachs analysts right now.Investors looking for fresh stock ideas in a volatile market can draw some inspiration from Goldman Sachs' US Conviction List.Updated monthly, the list features 20 to 25 names curated by an investment committee led by Steven Kron, director of Americas Equity Research.It's not an easy task, especially when Goldman Sachs has roughly 1,200 US stocks in its coverage universe. The list includes a selection of the most differentiated buying opportunities in the US stock market, and the committee uses a bottom-up process to determine the top stock picks.The stocks that make the director's cut aren't always the most popular ones, either — the list features many stocks with a less than 50% buy rating from Wall Street analysts.June marked the two year anniversary of the list. Since its inception, the list's hit rate, or percentage of stocks that have outperformed a stated benchmark, has been 47% and 52% relative to the cap-weighted and equal-weight S&P 500, respectively.While the list is meant to provide investment ideas and shouldn't be treated necessarily as a single portfolio, the cumulative performance of its constituents is quite strong. As a basket, the US Conviction List has returned 46% over its lifetime, outperforming the S&P 500 by 180 basis points and the equal-weighted S&P 500 by 1,560 basis points.This month, four new names were added, including the banking giant Capital One Financial (COF), which recently acquired competitor Discover Financial Services. After the transaction, Capital One is now the largest credit card issuer in the US, and Goldman Sachs believes the deal will allow the bank to grow its earnings by 34% in the next two years.Listed below are June's top stock picks, as well as each company's market cap, price target, and investment thesis.Philip Morris InternationalMarkets InsiderTicker: PMMarket cap: $281.1 billion12-month price target: $190Investment thesis: \"Leading the cigarette industry to a smoke-free future\"Bank of America CorpMarkets InsiderTicker: BACMarket cap: $332.4 billion12-month price target: $46Investment thesis: \"A deregulation beneficiary levered to an expanding economy\"Capital One Financial CorpMarkets InsiderTicker: COFMarket cap: $121.0 billion12-month price target: $242Investment thesis: \"Merger synergy story with network effects and a big buyback\"Houlihan Lokey IncMarkets InsiderTicker: HLIMarket cap: $12.2 billion12-month price target: $207Investment thesis: \"The right time for an acquisitive restructuring specialist\"Mid-America Apartment CommMarkets InsiderTicker: MAAMarket cap: $18.3 billion12-month price target: $192Investment thesis: \"Sunbelt migration beneficiary at a good time in the supply cycle\"Raymond James Financial IncMarkets InsiderTicker: RJFMarket cap: $29.7 billion12-month price target: $173Investment thesis: \"Strong earnings outlook with exposure to a Capital Markets recovery\"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals IncMarkets InsiderTicker: ALNYMarket cap: $39.7 billion12-month price target: $378Investment thesis: \"Catalyst-rich biotech company on the edge of an inflection\"Baxter International IncMarkets InsiderTicker: BAXMarket cap: $15.7 billion12-month price target: $39Investment thesis: \"Optimizing a profitable footprint\"Insmed IncMarkets InsiderTicker: INSMMarket cap: $12.7 billion12-month price target: $100Investment thesis: \"A product portfolio company emerging — at an inflection point\"Johnson & JohnsonMarkets InsiderTicker: JNJMarket cap: $373.4 billion12-month price target: $176Investment thesis: \"Navigating a patent cliff to a higher stock price\"Air Lease CorpMarkets InsiderTicker: ALMarket cap: $6.4 billion12-month price target: $69Investment thesis: \"A critical cog in a supply constrained airplane market\"Deere & CoMarkets InsiderTicker: DEMarket cap: $137.1 billion12-month price target: $610Investment thesis: \"Close to as bad as it is likely to get; an inflection story\"GE Vernova IncMarkets InsiderTicker: GEVMarket cap: $129.1 billion12-month price target: $500Investment thesis: \"Dominant position to electrify America\"Woodward IncMarkets InsiderTicker: WWDMarket cap: $12.9 billion12-month price target: $229Investment thesis: \"The right products for the right planes in the right cycle at the right time\"Kodiak Gas Services IncMarkets InsiderTicker: KGSMarket cap: $3.1 billion12-month price target: $44Investment thesis: \"An underappreciated steady cash flow compounder with a dominant market position\"Universal Display CorpMarkets InsiderTicker: OLEDMarket cap: $6.8 billion12-month price target: $183Investment thesis: \"Product cycle on steroids as OLED rolls out the color blue\"Viper Energy IncMarkets InsiderTicker: VNOMMarket cap: $11.5 billion12-month price target: $56Investment thesis: \"Asset light, scaling Permian pure play\"Cloudflare IncMarkets InsiderTicker: NETMarket cap: $57.5 billion12-month price target: $172Investment thesis: \"Security software platform with the product pipeline to grow share of wallet\"Onestream IncMarkets InsiderTicker: OSMarket cap: $6.7 billion12-month price target: $33Investment thesis: \"Early-stage growth compounder modernizing the Office of the CFO\"Pinterest IncMarkets InsiderTicker: PINSMarket cap: $21.0 billion12-month price target: $42Investment thesis: \"Well-positioned profitable compounder in the digital advertising space\"Snowflake IncMarkets InsiderTicker: SNOWMarket cap: $68.6 billion12-month price target: $230Investment thesis: \"Next layer Gen-AI winner with a new CEO focused on accelerating product innovation\"AT&TMarkets InsiderTicker: TMarket cap: $200.0 billion12-month price target: $31Investment thesis: \"Earnings upside from market discipline and broadband growth to drive valuation upside\"Uber Technologies IncMarkets InsiderTicker: UBERMarket cap: $176.0 billion12-month price target: $110Investment thesis: \"A disruptor not yet ready to be disrupted\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The housing market remains constrained in 2025. Goldman said mortgage rates will stay elevated, raising its year-end target for the 30-year mortgage rate. Jupiterimages/Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs raised its forecast for where mortgage rates will be at the end of 2025.Home affordability will continue to be a roadblock for prospective buyers, the bank said. Here's what the bank sees in store for the housing market in the second half of the year.The US housing market has been brutal for buyers to navigate in the last few years, leaving house hunters wondering when conditions might ease. Goldman Sachs shared three predictions this week about where things may be headed. The bank updated its forecast for the path of mortgage rates, predicted the impact of Donald Trump's possible move to shake up mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and examined the possible effects of lower immigration on supply. Here's what the bank sees ahead for US housing through the rest of 2025. Mortgage rates will stay elevatedDon't count on rate cuts to meaningfully bring mortgage rates down this year. Goldman Sachs raised its year-end prediction for the 30-year mortgage rate from 6.1% to 6.75%. That's not much lower than this week's average rate of about 6.9%. Mortgage rates are pegged to Treasury yields, which have been stuck at elevated levels as the bond market prices in sticky inflation and the possible impacts of higher US budget deficits. Any changes to Treasury yields — and mortgage rates — are likely to be driven by government spending and surprises in economic data.Goldman Sachs expects 10-year Treasury yields to rise as high as 4.5% by year-end, a level that many investors believe could push back against a stock market rally. With rates remaining high, the bank doesn't expect the home affordability picture to improve for the rest of the year, and home prices are likely to remain high thanks to low supply. The bank expects home prices to rise 3.2% in 2025, but elevated mortgage rates could cap that increase. Privatizing Fannie and Freddie will have little impact President Donald Trump has supported the idea of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that some commentators say could lead to elevated mortgage rates. However, Goldman Sachs doesn't think privatization of the mortgage finance firms, which were taken over in the wake of the 2008 crisis, will present material risks to mortgage rates.Analysts at JPMorgan and PIMCO have warned that privatization could lead to higher and more volatile borrowing costs, but Goldman Sachs argues that cost increases will be primarily constrained to higher loan-level price adjustments on \"non-core\" mortgage products such as investor loans and second-home loans, leaving those in the market for a primary residence untouched.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares have soared this year, but their performance has been largely uncorrelated with mortgage-backed securities spreads, signaling that investors remain confident in the federal guarantee.Home construction will hold up even as immigration declinesConcerns have grown about the impact of reduced immigration on single-family home construction, as immigrant workers make up roughly a quarter of the construction labor force. In an already supply-constrained market, reduced single-family construction could exacerbate the housing crisis by making labor more expensive and raising home prices for buyers. Yet, Goldman Sachs doesn't see reduced immigration as a major near-term risk to construction for two key reasons. Economic uncertainty and high mortgage rates have already put a damper on homebuilding activity, subsequently reducing labor demand. Single-family housing starts declined 12% year-over-year in April. Additionally, labor supply saw a big boost under the Biden administration, with around five million unauthorized or humanitarian immigrants entering the country between January 2021 and January 2025. Starting from a position of elevated immigration will lessen the negative impact of immigration outflows. Goldman Sachs estimates around 700,000 negative net immigrants through the end of 2026, or a 14% reduction.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs said it sees no convincing relationship between the 10-year Treasury return and annual S&P 500 returns in data going back to 1940. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesBond market volatility has made investors nervous, but stocks can still thrive amid high yields.Goldman analysts say there is little correlation between bond yields and median S&P 500 returns.Still, higher yields could constrain stocks for the time being, the bank wrote.The bond market's recent freakout over tariffs and the deficit has received a lot of attention from nervous stock investors, but one chart shows the S&P 500 can keep climbing higher in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.Analysts at the investment bank pointed to investor concern swirling around the US bond market, with Treasury yields spiking in recent weeks as traders fretted over the US's yawning budget deficit and the impact of tariffs on the economy.Those worries sent the 10-year US Treasury yield — a reflection of long-term interest rate expectations in the economy — past 4.5% in late May. The 10-year yield has since pulled back slightly to trade around 4.4%.But historically, the 10-year US Treasury yield hasn't had all that much of an impact on annual S&P 500 returns, the bank said.The S&P 500 has posted a higher median annual gain when the 10-year yield was both higher and lower than its current level, Goldman's analysis found.Robert Shiller, Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchSince 1940, when the 10-year yield hovered between 4% and 5%, the benchmark index saw a median gain of 11%. But stocks have gained more in years when the yield was both higher and lower, analysts said, concluding there was no clear relationship between bond yields and stock market returns.\"We believe that the drivers and speed of changes in bond yields matter more for equities than a specific level of rates,\" analysts wrote in a client note last week.Goldman still thinks that bond yields at current levels near 4.5% should \"constrain the magnitude\" of how much the S&P 500's valuation can grow. Historically, stocks have struggled to move higher once bond yields rise more than two standard deviations in a single month, which would be equivalent to the 10-year US Treasury yield spiking to 4.9% from its current levels, the analysts said.Still, the bank expects the 10-year yield to hover around its current levels for the rest of 2025, pointing to expectations that the economy will still see \"below-trend\" growth and \"above-target\" inflation. Lower growth can influence the Fed to cut interest rates to boost the economy, but higher prices influence the central bank to keep rates steady to control inflation, leaving monetary policy at a standstill.The S&P 500 also looks like it's trading close to fair value from a price-to-earnings perspective, Goldman said, suggesting the index could remain relatively flat for some time. Still, investors have been wary of wild swings in the bond market lately, with some commentators speculating that bond vigilantes — traders who stage a sell-off in bonds to protest government policies — may be influencing yields higher. Historically, these swings are unusual, and could be a sign that investors are growing more wary about purchasing US debt securities as a safe haven, investing experts told BI.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "From left: Goldman Sachs' Denis Coleman; Morgan Stanley's Lauren Belmonte.Courtesy of Goldman Sachs, Morgan StanleyThousands of junior bankers and interns are starting their Wall Street careers this summer.Goldman Sachs' CFO and a top Morgan Stanley ECM banker shared their advice for getting ahead.They both suggested saying \"yes\" to things you might feel are beneath you.It's June on Wall Street, which means more outdoor coffee chats, summer rentals in the Hamptons, and hordes of young people taking their inaugural steps toward a financial services career.Investment banking internships tend to kick off in early June, while training for first-year investment banking analysts typically starts a few weeks later.One of the top considerations undoubtedly on the minds of these newcomers is how to show their bosses they're the right people to bet on for future promotions or job offers.In an effort to help them along, Business Insider asked people who've made it on Wall Street to reveal the best advice they've received over the years that influenced the direction of their lives and careers.We spoke to Denis Coleman, Goldman Sachs' chief financial officer, who shared how his trust in his boss (David Solomon before he was CEO) paid off when it came to a career move he initially didn't want.We also heard from Lauren Belmonte, head of technology equity capital markets in the Americas at Morgan Stanley, who shared this piece of memorable advice she got from her mentor when she was starting out: \"If someone you respect asks you to go sharpen pencils for them, you should do it.\"The pencil analogy may feel dated in an age of AI chatbots and Excel spreadsheets, but the premise of the advice offered by both of these top executives involves saying \"yes\" to things we may feel are below us if we want to earn our place at the table and prove that we're genuinely interested in contributing to the company's success.Frank advice like this can be hard to find in the buttoned-up hallways of Wall Street banks, which is why we are presenting Coleman and Belmonte's advice in their own words, lightly edited for length and clarity.Denis ColemanFirm: Goldman SachsTitle: Chief Financial OfficerGoldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman.Courtesy of Goldman SachsSoon after I made partner at the firm, I was asked if I would be willing to change geographies from New York to London and transition from running a large developed business to leading a smaller activity. My first reaction was to simply ask: Why would I trade a large opportunity for what seemed like a smaller one?The co-head of my division at the time and the champion for this career move was David Solomon, who also happens to be my current boss, and he was quick to point out that I was looking at the opportunity the wrong way. It was not about trading from a big business to a small business but rather seizing an opportunity that could make a meaningful difference for the firm.His guidance reframed my thinking. I moved to London, and over the ensuing years for a variety of reasons, our European financing business grew significantly.The push to move to London was not only a great career move for me, but also enhanced our ability to compete in EMEA. The lesson was equally important: Trust the firm, trust the people you work with, and be willing to take risks with your career. That's how you end up making a difference.When I was a junior analyst at Goldman Sachs, I was given a piece of tactical advice that would shape how I looked at career development: If you are looking to accelerate your career, identify the aspects of your boss's job or the tasks they are responsible for that don't necessarily require their personal oversight, and offer to take on the responsibility.You will free your manager from some of their less strategic tasks, enabling them to spend more time and energy on the things that benefit the business the most. In addition, as a more junior party, taking on these responsibilities will give you an opportunity to gain exposure to things that a more senior person is usually tasked with.You need to work hard and do your job with excellence, but you can separate yourself by volunteering to take on more to develop your skills and free up the time of those above you.Lauren BelmonteFirm: Morgan StanleyTitle: Head of technology equity capital markets in the Americas, managing directorMorgan Stanley's head of technology equity capital markets in the Americas, Lauren Belmonte.Courtesy of Morgan StanleyWhen I started working at Morgan Stanley as an associate out of business school, I had the fortunate opportunity to partner with Jim Runde — a legendary banker on Wall Street with a multi-decade career. I met him at the stage in his career where he was focused on developing talent across our investment banking teams.In our regular coffee catchups, he would share very practical, actionable advice including on building relationships with clients (\"of course, turn up prepared and ready to ask for the business, but always turn up to meetings early\") or on building trust in a team (\"praise in public, criticize in private\").One piece of advice that has been very impactful to my career was his focus on seeking out opportunities with smart, interesting people. He would say, \"If someone you respect asks you to go sharpen pencils for them, you should do it.\"This advice has stuck with me in part because the example itself is extreme — nobody is sharpening pencils at Morgan Stanley — but also because it aligns with my experiences to date.Jim's counsel was that it matters who you are around and not the specific task you are focused on. I actively seek out opportunities with varied colleagues at Morgan Stanley as well as with clients across industries because of his advice. There is no doubt that opportunities arise from working with dynamic people and it brings out the best in you. Now as I lead our technology IPO business, I look to partner with energetic founders and insightful investors as it brings out the best in my work, and it also keeps me learning and growing.Have a tip?

        "description": "Structural risks in the US are shaking up long-held market correlations in stocks, bonds, and currencies. Tradtional market correlations have diverged recently, challenging portfolio management.Seth Wenig/APMarkets are volatile, with stocks, bonds, and currencies defying historical patterns.Investor concerns include trade wars, tariffs, bond market issues, and US debt sustainability.Goldman Sachs suggests hedging with gold and positioning for dollar weakness against major currencies.Markets have turned turbulent in recent months amid a wave of new risks that disrupt long-held relationships among stocks, bonds, and currencies.\"Recent episodes of simultaneous equity, bond, and dollar declines within that period, especially since early April, have led investors to question whether cross-asset correlations have shifted,\" wrote Vickie Chang, a macro strategist at Goldman Sachs, on Thursday.Investor sentiment has been shaken by President Donald Trump's trade war and concerns over import tariffs, bond market dysfunction, the Federal Reserve's independence, and US debt sustainability.One of the most striking developments is the decline of US stocks, bonds, and the dollar all at once in what some are calling the \"Sell America\" trade.This is unusual because bonds typically serve as a cushion when stocks drop, while the dollar tends to strengthen in times of market stress. But the US Dollar Index has already dropped about 8% this year.This is challenging commonly used hedges and typical portfolio strategies, wrote Chang.Chang pointed out \"newer worries\" about the structural risks of Federal Reserve independence and fiscal sustainability in the US that are shaking up normal market patterns. If these concerns persist, asset correlations could stay off-kilter.Investors should consider three moves to hedge the implications of the fallout from the unusual market movements, she wrote:Position for dollar weakness: especially against the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, to protect against new risks and against US-specific growth worries.Consider buying gold: It's likely to protect against newer structural risks, Chang wrote.Gold is trading around $3,300 an ounce. Goldman Sachs expects the yellow metal to reach $3,700 an ounce by year-end and $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026.Watch risks from longer-dated bonds: Long-dated bonds might not reduce risk as much as they normally do.If concerns about the Fed's independence and US debt hit bond prices, these risks would hurt long-dated bonds harder than shorter-dated ones.Meanwhile, shorter-dated bond yields should protect against equity downside if the market registers clear concerns about economic growth, Chang wrote. She added that the Fed would cut interest rates if the growth outlook weakens materially.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman's president and COO, John Waldron, said the bank is bracing for more volatility as Trump disrupts traditional DC policymaking. Goldman Sachs president and COO John Waldron.SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs is tamping down risk, the bank's President and COO, John Waldron, said on Thursday.He cited \"disruptive policy change\" coming from Washington, starting with Trump's trade war.Tariffs, he said, may be just the first shock to the system.Goldman Sachs is battening down the hatches as it braces for a wave of volatility resulting from disruptive policy changes in Washington.\"I would say, at the moment, we're relatively defensively positioned,\" the bank's President and COO, John Waldron, said at a conference on Thursday. \"We've got heavy liquidity. We've got significant capital buffers. And we're running more muted risk in certain and important pockets in the firm.\"Trump's tariffs and trade war pronouncements have roiled markets in recent weeks, exposing Wall Street to more stressors than many traders and dealmakers anticipated when the former New York businessman returned to power earlier this year.On Thursday, Waldron said tariffs are just one piece of the puzzle — and no longer as concerning as they were when they were rolled out.\"We're moving, as we said, towards more manageable tariff levels,\" Waldron said, adding, \"I think we're likely to avoid a recession with this baseline set of facts.\"Even if the president's tariff wars are quickly resolved, the barrage of seismic policy shifts will likely continue, he said.\"The Trump administration is definitely disrupting a lot of what would be the conventional wisdom of how US policymaking traditionally goes,\" he said at the annual Bernstein Strategic Decisions conference in New York.\"You see first-order impacts right in front of you,\" he said, referring to the tariffs. \"The second- and third-order impacts take longer to work their way through markets. And so we're watching carefully for the second- and third-order impacts, which is another reason why we run a little bit higher buffer and a little bit more cautiously in an environment like this.\"\"So we're going to learn a lot more, and it's going to be volatile,\" he said. \"I think we're just got to live with that volatility for some time.\"Waldron pointed to two cues that the firm is watching. The first, he said, is leverage in the public sector. Governments have much less wiggle room to inject stimulus into battered economies to maneuver out of tough fiscal positions, diminishing their ability to fend off economic shocks.\"I think coming out of COVID, the public sector stimulus from governments around the world to rejuvenate the economy was really, really important,\" he said. \"We're starting to see some elements of that public sector leverage play through. There's a lot less fiscal headroom in the world today than there was back when we were coming through COVID and a pretty peaceful environment.\"He also pointed to something the firm is terming \"lowflation\" — that is, its forecast that, because of tariffs, the US should ready itself for \"short- to immediate-term slower growth\" and \"higher inflation.\" He said Goldman's research showed that the best case scenario for effective tariffs would be between 10% to 15%, still a significant uptick from pre-Trump administration levels.In good news, Waldron said that US consumers had continued to exhibit \"tremendous resilience\" in the face of these headwinds, and that the firm's pipeline of forthcoming transactions remained strong.\"Not surprisingly, the second quarter is not quite as strong from an activity level as the first quarter, given the macro environment we talked about at the beginning of this conversation,\" he said, adding, \"But in investment banking, our engagement levels are actually still very good despite the uncertainty and the volatility our pipelines remain quite strong.\"\"When you have this kind of volatility,\" he said, \"you just fundamentally have a harder time prosecuting transactions that may be in your pipeline.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said he is confident in the bank’s dealmaking pipeline despite tariff-related uncertainty. “Our investment banking business is very strong, and I think the outlook remains quite good,” said Waldron, whose comments to investors at a conference Thursday (May 29) were reported by Reuters. “The pipeline is strong all over the world … but as we’ve already said, the element of volatility makes it hard” to predict when deals will come to pass. Corporate clients have optimistic outlooks regarding transactions and are still talking about mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and about raising capital, he said, per the report. While there has been a wider slump in M&A, Waldron pointed to a 30% increase in large deals valued at more than $500 million so far this year as a sign of market resilience, the report said. “Obviously, in the second quarter, it’s been much slower than in the first … Nonetheless, even post-Liberation Day, we’ve worked on a number of very sizable, important M&A transactions,” Waldron said, per the report. The weeks and months since the new administration took power in Washington have seen several headlines about muted M&A activity, especially since the advent of new tariffs. From the start of the year until April 21, the number of M&A deals was down 19%, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing data from LSEG. In February, there were no announced deals anywhere in the world valued at more than $10 billion, the first time that has happened in more than two years. Meanwhile, tariff-fueled uncertainty is impacting how companies “plan, develop and produce products, from consumer electronics to clothing,” PYMNTS wrote Thursday (May 28). Forthcoming research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that 25% of product leaders have switched their product designs, pricing or go-to-market strategies, according to a survey of 60 heads of product, chief product officers and vice presidents of product at middle-market goods and retail firms in the first half of April. Another 14% said they have delayed or simply canceled product development. The pivots indicate a disruption to companies’ strategic growth initiatives and near-term operational stability. Every executive interviewed reported at least some impact from the tariffs. The post Goldman Sachs President John Waldron: Dealmaking Outlook Is Still ‘Quite Good’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Apollo Global Management is reportedly working with five banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group, to trade private credit. The collaboration will enable Apollo and its partners to syndicate investment grade debt on a larger scale, with the banks acting as broker-dealers, Bloomberg reported Thursday (May 29). With the extra liquidity, Apollo will be able to originate larger loans and continue helping individual clients who need to redeem their investments more often than institutions, according to the report. The collaboration came as Apollo has been working to build a marketplace for private credit deals and to increase the number of buyers on the secondary market, the report said. Banks have also planned to build trading desks for this market, per the report. Big banks have detailed the lure of private credit and their longer-term plans in the space, PYMNTS reported in October. Over several months, there have been announcements between banks and private equity firms that have sought to link up with private equity outfits and gain a share of the estimated $1.7 trillion private credit industry. The private credit market has been booming as it offers a capital “lifeline” of sorts to a variety of borrowers, especially smaller firms that have been, or still are, underserved as they seek capital from traditional markets. Private lending may also be extended to firms that are backed by private equity vehicles. The capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter’s end customers isincreasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across the spectrum, PYMNTS reported May 9. A report by the Boston Fed showed that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions, a category that includes private equity and private credit. It was reported in September that Apollo and State Street were launching a private-public credit exchange-trade fund that will hold mostly investment-grade debt, including private credit originated by Apollo. The report noted that retail investors are expected to become a much larger purchaser of alternative investments like private credit, citing estimates from consultancy Cerulli Associates, which estimated that financial advisers will increase their holdings of such investments from $1.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion by the end of 2025.

        "description": "I’ve spent the last 24 years as a charity auctioneer on stages around the world selling anything and everything to potential bidders. From Robinhood to Goldman Sachs, the biggest names in business and philanthropy entrust me to win over audiences and secure the sale. When I give talks about selling, I always kick things off with one simple question: What’s the most important part of sales? The answers I get are all over the place and sometimes hilarious: persuasion, charm, bringing good snacks . . . but few people get it right. The most important part of sales is listening. This fact is just as true when you’re pitching investors as it is when you’re closing a deal. If you want investors to take you seriously, your pitch can’t be a one-size-fits-all presentation. It has to be tailored to their interests and needs. Your goal should be to meet your audience where they are, not where you are. Here are three surefire ways to make sure you stand out the next time you’re pitching a crowd. 1. Know your audience Before you craft a single bullet point on your deck, ask yourself: Who am I pitching to? What do they invest in? What gets them excited? What have they backed in the past? If your business doesn’t immediately fit into their portfolio, find a commonality to draw them in. Help them draw the line from what they know to what you’re offering. Show them how your vision connects to their world, even if it takes a little creativity. As a charity auctioneer, I’m often handed a sheet of paper with 10 lines about a trip or an item being auctioned off, then am told to get on stage and simply “Raise a million dollars.” I only loosely employ the notes I’m given; I think of them as a reference point rather than the selling point. Because a powerful pitch isn’t about reading a sheet of paper and regurgitating facts—it’s about telling a story that taps into the audience’s emotions. I find the pain point or the dream, and I make it personal. When you’re pitching investors, do the same. Don’t just sell your product. Sell the feeling. Sell the why. Tell the story. 2. Find common ground and lead with it In public speaking, I tell people to “sell to the thing that unites you with the person across the table.” Investors care about your margins, absolutely, but they need to connect with you and believe that you are the type of person they want to invest their time and energy in for the long term. Start your pitch with something that grounds everyone. I like to start with something simple like: “It’s late in the day. I know you’re tired, but I want you to know I’m going to bring the energy to keep you awake.” That simple acknowledgment shows you are invested in making your time with them as engaging as possible. Then, personalize the pitch. If you looked at their website and saw nothing like your potential investment, address it head on instead of shying away from it: “I saw that you’ve invested in sustainable materials and emerging markets. You might be wondering why you’d invest in a platform for teachers—but here’s the connection . . .” Don’t let your audience sit there wondering why they’re in the room. Tell them. Draw the bridge. Find the thread that links your vision to their interest. And if you’re pitching something they might be inclined to dismiss—say, a luxury product to a tech investor—be ready to pivot. During auctions, I am constantly coming up with different ways that someone might use the item I’m selling. A few weeks ago, a nonprofit was delighted to tell me they had secured a ski house in Aspen for their charity auction gala. While they were excited, I thought about it differently. Not everyone likes to ski, nor do they want to visit somewhere in the cold weather. I immediately asked them “Can the house be used in the summer too?” The broader the appeal, the stronger your pitch. Don’t get shut down before you even begin. The more ways you can encourage someone to view what you are selling, the better chance you will have of selling it. 3. Do the work before you get in the room The best place to hear a tough question? In the comfort of your living room. When you are preparing for a big presentation, practice until it looks like you are a natural. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so make it count. Rehearse the pitch with people who don’t know your business inside and out. Their questions will expose assumptions you didn’t know you were making, and help you refine your message so it lands with confidence. Practice in front of friends, family, former colleagues, or anyone willing to poke holes in your presentation. The harder the questions, the better. You want to know your blind spots before you get in the room with an investor.",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs analysts said they see alternatives to protect portfolios from volatility as bonds and stocks often sell off in tandem this year. ROMAIN COSTASECA/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty ImagesBonds haven't shielded investors from heavy volatility this year as well as they have in the past. Gold and oil futures can help long-term investors hedge against risks to the economy, Goldman Sachs says.The bank suggested investors have a heavy exposure to the precious metal. Times are tough for the average 60/40 investor.Where a split between stocks and bonds once indicated a diversified portfolio that could handle a range of external shocks, tariffs and economic uncertainty have made fixed income less of a hedge against volatility. \"Long-term US bonds have recently failed to protect against equity downside, both in early April as tariff escalation caused major concern about US economic governance and recession risk, but also last week when long-term US borrowing costs jumped on fiscal sustainability worries,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote on Wednesday.Goldman SachsThe bank said that this isn't altogether a new phenomenon: equities and bond markets have fallen in tandem in the past, especially during inflation or commodity shocks. But for better protection, Goldman suggested two alternative assets for the long-term investor: gold and oil.\"The key reason is that gold and oil are critical hedges against the two major inflation shocks that can hit equity-bond portfolio returns. Gold hedges against losses in central bank and fiscal credibility, while oil often protects against negative supply shocks,\" Goldman wrote.Adding both gold and enhanced oil futures can bring down average annual volatility in a 60/40 portfolio from 10% to under 7%, Goldman added.Goldman SachsOverweight, underweightThe analysts suggested an overweight position in the yellow metal for investors planning to hold the asset for over five years.So far in 2025, bullion has surged 26.6%, breaking through a string of records. Much of that has to do with the policy concerns coming from Washington, DC, something Goldman doesn't expect will reverse quickly. Fiscal sustainability, debt concerns, and White House threats against Federal Reserve independence are all bullish for gold.\"If these concerns intensify, private investors could drive gold prices well beyond our current forecast of $3,700/toz by year-end and $4,000/toz by mid-2026.\"Meanwhile, analysts expect global de-dollarization to continue, which means that foreign central banks will keep piling up their gold reserves as they diversify away from the greenback. This has been happening in earnest since 2023, when fresh doubts about the dollar spurred nations to search for alternatives.Investors should hold positive but underweight exposure to oil — though it can protect against supply shocks, high capacity reduces the risk of a shortage in 2025 and 2026, Goldman wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Here's why inflation won't reach record-breaking 2022 levels, according to Goldman Sachs. d3sign/Getty ImagesCompanies are raising prices in response to tariffs, fueling inflation concerns.Goldman Sachs believes tariffs will cause a one-time increase in inflation.The bank shares three reasons a tariff-induced inflation spike won't be permanent.As companies such as Walmart and Target consider raising prices due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, Americans might be wondering if they're in for another round of record-breaking inflation a la 2022, when price increases reached a 40-year high.Goldman Sachs has some good news for inflation-weary consumers and investors: tariffs will only cause a temporary blip in inflation.In a note published Monday, Goldman Sachs economists said they expect core PCE inflation to rise to 3.6% by the end of 2025. However, they believe the jump will reflect a one-time price level adjustment rather than the start of a new sustained inflation surge.Goldman Sachs predicts a tariff-induced inflation surge will be much more subdued than the 2022 scare.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs outlined three reasons why you shouldn't expect a repeat of 2021-2022 levels of inflation from tariffs.Primarily, the bank believes that tariff-induced inflation won't be as extreme as what consumers saw in 2022. David Mericle, the firm's chief US economist, said tariffs would only raise consumer prices by 2% over the next year and a half. The majority of the change in PCE will come from the direct impact of increased import prices and higher domestic production costs. The smaller magnitude of price increases should prevent inflation from becoming psychologically entrenched in setting prices and wages.Goldman SachsSecondly, the labor market has become more subdued in recent years. Back in 2022, a tight labor market led to a wage-price spiral as higher wages led to higher prices. It's harder to get a job now than it was in 2022, which means wage growth is cooling and no longer significantly driving inflation.Goldman Sachs' wage survey leading indicator, which asks households and businesses about future wage growth expectations, has dropped from above 4% in 2022 to 2.9% now.Goldman SachsConsumers also have less cash on hand to spend, meaning that demand is subdued, further reducing the long-term impacts of inflation. During the pandemic, households had excess savings from stimulus measures, which gave companies more room to raise prices without taking a big hit to sales. Today, companies aren't at liberty to do so anymore, as household spending power has faded.At the end of the day, a weak economy isn't good for GDP growth, but it creates a disinflationary drag. Goldman Sachs expects economic growth to be weak this year as GDP growth slows to just 1% and the unemployment rate ticks up to 4.5%.\"We are skeptical about the prospects for prolonged high inflation amidst mediocre economic performance,\" Mericle wrote.The bank expects the bulk of the tariff inflation impacts to show up in the May through August inflation reports and slowly fade away afterward.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Mega-cap tech stocks got off to a rocky start in 2025, but the cohort is now trading at a valuation that could be an good entry point, Goldman said. Retail traders stayed bullish even as stocks saw their worst sell-off in five years over the last week.Noam Galai/Getty ImagesThe market's top tech stocks will outperform the rest of the S&P 500 again this year, Goldman says.That prediction comes even as the rest of the index has outperformed the mega-cap cohort this year. The top tech stocks are trading closer to attractive valuations again, the bank said.The stock market's tech titans stumbled in the first quarter, but 2025 will still be another winning year for the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs said. In a recent note, chief equity strategist David Kostin projected that the mega-cap tech cohort will once again outperform the rest of the S&P 500 in 2025, extending a streak of stellar gains to a third straight year. \"We continue to expect that superior earnings growth will drive the Magnificent 7 to outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by a smaller magnitude than in recent years,\" Kostin wrote. \"The share price outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has been tied to their earnings growth outperformance.\"Goldman SachsIt's a take that might seem contradictory to what's transpired so far this year, as trade policy, AI disruptions, and antitrust moves have muddled the outlook for Big Tech. The group, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, is down 5% year-to-date, trailing the 4% gain achieved by the broader index. Some big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, have called on investors to reduce tech exposure.Ye, despite the slump so far, Kostin noted that mega-cap tech demonstrated earnings outperformance in the first quarter. In 2025, earnings-per-share growth has surged 28% for the Mag Seven, handily outpacing 9% for the S&P 493.\"This magnitude of surprise was the largest since the 2Q 2021 reporting season when the Magnificent 7 beat earnings estimates by 27%,\" the bank wrote. \"Partly as a result of strong 1Q results, consensus 2025 earnings estimates for the Magnificent 7 are roughly in line with where they began the year.\"Goldman SachsWhat's more, the top tech stocks are now trading at a discounted valuation, resulting from narrowing earnings growth compared to previous years.\"The relative valuation is the lowest it's been in the last two years,\" Kostin told Bloomberg TV. \"From a starting point of entry, it's actually looking somewhat more attractive at these levels.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman said tariffs could overshadow and boost to the economy provided by Republicans' sweeping fiscal package, which includes big tax and spending cuts. Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesAny boost to growth provided by the GOP tax bill will be offset by tariffs, Goldman Sachs wrote.Investors have been waiting for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus to boost the market.A sweeping fiscal package was advanced by a vote in the House of Representatives on Sunday. With Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" working its way through Congress, some may be growing hopeful that the sweeping fiscal package could provide a fresh boost to markets and the economy. That might be the case were it not for an equally powerful force facing the US: tariffs. Writing on Monday, analysts at Goldman Sachs said that the trade war might complicate the outlook for tax and spending cuts to provide a tailwind to growth. \"The hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package,\" a team led by Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote. Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchAfter President Donald Trump's election win last November, investors grew convinced that pro-growth policies were coming to uplift both the economy and markets. Forecasted tax cuts and promises of deregulation fueled post-election gains, though both efforts were soon overshadowed by Trump's aggressive tariff campaign.Since then, trade negotiations have taken the edge off of last month's \"liberation day\" tariff package, and a budget bill has emerged on Capitol Hill. Included are tax cuts and efforts to deliver fiscal stimulus. To some economists, this has the potential to reignite economic growth, with positive implications for stocks.While Goldman didn't speculate on what the bill would do for markets, it emphasized that the drag from tariffs will overshadow any boost to the economy.Of course, things could still change, the bank said. There's the chance that state and local tax policy deductions become more generous, for instance, or that federal spending cuts occur sooner than is scheduled in the bill's current draft.Goldman SachsIn a May 12 note, Hatzius raised his 2025 US growth forecast to 1%, after the US and China temporarily dialed back tariffs.

President Donald Trump's social media posts show he is focused on the oil market.Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs analysts scrutinized President Donald Trump's social media posts for oil price insights.They said Trump's posts show a correlation with oil prices.The analysts concluded that the president prefers West Texas Intermediate prices in the $40-$50 a barrel range.President Donald Trump's social media posts have long gripped global markets. Now, even Goldman Sachs commodity analysts are scrutinizing them for clues to his views on oil prices.In an analysis of Trump's social media posts on Twitter and Truth Social, Goldman's analysts concluded that the president appears to favor West Texas Intermediate oil in the $40 to $50 barrel range.They wrote that Trump's \"propensity to post about oil prices bottoms\" when prices are in this price range.US WTI oil futures are now trading around $63 a barrel — well above Trump's apparent comfort zone.The analysts reviewed more than 1,000 posts from 16 years to identify patterns in Trump's thinking on oil. Energy market-related topics accounted for just over 1% of Trump's social media posts.\"President Trump has always been focused on energy markets, oil, and on US energy dominance, having posted nearly 900 times about energy markets since he joined Twitter in 2009,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts in a Tuesday report.Lower energy prices are one of Trump's campaign promises, as higher oil prices drive inflation.However, Trump also has a \"drill, baby, drill\" agenda that aims to boost the US's energy dominance and increase the country's fossil fuel production.Trump tends to call for lower prices — or celebrate declining prices — when WTI prices move above $50 a barrel, wrote the analysts at Goldman.\"President Trump has called for higher prices when prices are very low (WTI<$30), often in the context of supporting US production,\" they added.Goldman estimates average breakeven prices for US shale producers at $51 a barrel.While Trump seems to like lower prices for consumers, he likely wouldn't want prices so low that they hurt American oil producers.\"We believe several policymakers recognize the tendency for US oil supply growth to slow down when WTI prices drop into the $60s and approach the breakeven price of numerous producers,\" they added. To be sure, Goldman analysts expect Trump's impact on global oil production to be limited in the short term. Furthermore, US regulatory easing may also only boost production significantly over the longer term.However, \"President Trump's inferred preference for relatively low oil prices directionally supports our view that oil prices are likely to edge lower in 2025-2026,\" they wrote.Goldman forecast the WTI oil price to average $56 a barrel for the rest of 2025 and $52 a barrel in 2026.Oil prices have been under pressure this year due to recession fears, fueled by Trump's trade war and OPEC's plans to boost output.The WTI oil price has risen around 9% over the last five trading days due to positive sentiment over the US's trade deal with China. However, it is still about 12% lower year to date.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Goldman Sachs Group is reportedly considering expanding its retail bank, Marcus, to Ireland and Germany. The company has held early-stage discussions with Irish regulators and is taking another look at Germany, where it once planned to launch in 2019, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 13), citing unnamed sources. A representative for Goldman said in the report: “We remain focused on that business in the U.S. and U.K. and are exploring our options for future growth areas.” Ireland is seen as an opportunity for Marcus because the country has only three major banks and a few FinTechs, and household deposits earn lower average interest than those in the euro area as a whole, according to the report. Goldman is looking to expand because the U.K. has a cap on how much it can raise from depositors before it can no longer use their cash to fund its investment bank, the report said. However, there have been some calls to remove that cap. If that rule were to be eliminated, and Goldman could raise as much as it wanted in the U.K., the company would be less likely to expand to other European countries, per the report. It was reported in May 2019 that Goldman Sachs decided to delay the German launch of Marcus, which it had announced a year earlier, because a rush to launch the consumer bank in the country would have been expensive. Goldman Sachs said in January that it created a Capital Solutions Group to bring together its financing, origination, structuring and risk management solutions in its Global Banking & Markets business, and that it would expand the alternatives investment team in its Asset & Wealth Management business. The company said both moves were meant to enhance its ability to serve corporate and investor clients and grow its business in private credit. “Our strategy and core franchise strengths position Goldman Sachs to operate at the fulcrum of one of the most important structural trends taking place in finance: the emergence and growth of private credit and other asset classes that can be privately deployed,” Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO David Solomon said at the time in a press release.

        "description": "Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIGoldman Sachs has been building out its generative AI toolkit.The firm aims to release one of its tools, an AI assistant, to most staff this year.Here's a look at five such tools — the promise of what they can do, plus who's using them and how.Last summer, Goldman Sachs' tech chief, Marco Argenti, shared a \"completely not scientific\" prediction with Business Insider that, in about three years, almost \"100%\" of Goldman's global workforce would interact with artificial intelligence while doing their jobs.\"It's going to be just like email at the end of the day,\" Argenti, the bank's chief information officer, said about AI in the 2024 interview, calling it \"something that in some form is going to touch everyone.\" About a year later, the firm appears to be well on the way toward its goal.Argenti came to Wall Street in 2019 by way of Amazon's gigantic cloud business, and now finds himself at the nexus of the bank's accelerating AI strategy. With his help, the firm has rolled out multiple AI-powered tools for about 10,000 members of its more than 46,000-person worldwide workforce. It's planning to expand some — like its AI Assistant chatbot — to all employees by the year's end.On the firm's most recent earnings call, CEO David Solomon told shareholders he was expecting big things from AI — like his belief that it will \"transform our engineering capabilities\" and \"modernize our technology stack.\"Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.ReutersTop executives report witnessing some of the benefits Solomon was pointing to. Melissa Goldman, a partner and global head of engineering in the banking and markets division, told BI that software engineers using the developer copilot had seen efficiency gains of up to 20%.Goldman's growing suite of tools so far aims to boost employees' productivity. The firm is creating copilots designed to remove some of the drudgery from bankers' lives, for instance, like assembling presentations and prepping for client meetings; and AI polyglots fluent in several languages, saving research-distribution teams days burned doing manual translations.All the tools were built on the bank's proprietary GS AI Platform, which debuted in 2024. It's equipped with access to some of the most prominent large language models, like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, but a protective layer was added to insulate the firm's sensitive data from outsiders.Over the past year, BI has talked to multiple Goldman executives, including Argenti and Goldman, about their AI strategy. Through interviews and a review of the firm's public comments, we compiled intel about five of Goldman's AI tools, including what they do and whom they were made for. Details about each one tell a story about where the bank stands today on its AI journey.Here's everything we know.GS AI AssistantWhat it does: Goldman Sachs' in-house version of ChatGPTThink of the GS AI Assistant as a sidekick for Goldman employees.It uses a chat interface, similar to that of ChatGPT, but can pull its responses from the bank's confidential data repository. Right now, it's available to about 10,000 workers; the firm is intending to get it in the hands of the rest of the bank's workforce of over 46,000 by the end of the year.It can perform a variety of functions, helping executives draft presentations and plan off-site meetings, or serving as a \"personal tutor\" for quant strategists. What's more, this system is a backbone of Goldman's AI offerings — a wellspring from which several other tools, like Translate AI, described below, have emerged.As seven Goldman employees ranging from analyst to partner recently told BI, the GS AI Assistant is becoming part of daily life at the firm. These regular users spoke about use cases ranging from learning about printing call options and authoring original lines of code to preparing notes to guide intense strategic discussions.\"I use it every day for getting a head start on traditionally time-consuming tasks,\" said one engineering associate about how he leverages the tech. It's been \"saving me hours every week,\" the associate, Konstantin Kuchenmeister, added.Banker CopilotWhat it does: Streamlines some aspects of investment bankers' jobsMembers of Goldman's investment banking division are also set to get an AI boost with the bank's so-called banker copilot, which makes access to high-level, protected data about matters like deal-making available to eligible users. Only a small group numbering in the dozens has access to it right now since it's in the early stages of development.But the promise of what the AI assistant could represent for the banking business is hard to deny. Solomon himself has acknowledged the potential for AI to automate large chunks of tedious processes, like drafting S-1 regulatory disclosures for initial public offerings, for instance.The banker copilot is expected to help users in several ways: among them, compiling data on clients and deals, analyzing corporate filings for hard-to-find cues that bankers would want to know about, drafting lengthy documents, or summarizing notes. It will have access to special subsets of data only to those authorized to see it.Legend AI QueryWhat it does: A search tool that uses AI to navigate the bank's vast repository of dataGoldman uses a system called Legend, an open-source data management and governance platform. Accessing Goldman's vast vault of knowledge used to require users to know what they were looking for — as well as where they were looking — ahead of time, using a tool called \"Legend Query.\" Think of this process as being like perusing dozens of stacks in a library, but without a librarian to help.Enter Legend AI Query, a query tool that saves time by tapping artificial intelligence to serve as that librarian. Legend AI Query, which is in early stages of its rollout, is the firm's digital research assistant for accessing data using natural language descriptions. Neema Raphael, Goldman's chief data officer, told BI that this interface, combined with the bank's data, amounted to an \"information superintelligence to help the human build a better mental model faster and quicker.\"Here's how it works: To access files that could be deep within the bowels of Legend, all a user has to do is enter a query into the system in plain English and AI will do the rest. Examples of requests could look like:Show me all swap trades with financial institution Y in Americas by the rates desk on May 1, 2025Give me a list of commercial loan facilities that are maturing today.Can I get the last price for April 25 crude oil futures with ticker XYZ?Legend CopilotWhat it does: A fast-tracked way to upload data onto Legend, and keep the system organizedLegend Copilot, which launched in October, is a tool primarily designed for use by data engineers to maintain Legend's infrastructure, and keep its information streams organized for others to access.Legend draws on data that originates in other databases, but still needs to be routed into the centralized Legend system. The AI-powered assistant enables Goldman's engineers to generate end-to-end data models or APIs in minutes, though it used to be a much lengthier process when they did it manually.The copilot also gives engineers templates on which they can create new reports, models, or APIs, streamlining the whole process.Translate AIWhat it does: In-house language translation to and from EnglishAs a global bank, Goldman Sachs has clients worldwide. Sometimes, those clients have a preferred language that's not English.To reach clients in their non-English speaking language, the bank would historically outsource some of this translation work, but turnaround times could stretch into days. That's why Goldman built Translate AI, an in-house and generative AI-powered solution that can translate text in seconds or minutes, on top of its GS AI Assistant platform.Teams within groups like asset and wealth management or global investment research are using Translate AI, which translates to and from English. Kerry Blum, a partner and global head of the equity structuring group who manages assets of high-net-worth individuals, told BI that members of her team were using the tool to translate writing in nine different languages so far.Have a tip?

        "description": "The stock market looks like it's gone from pricing in the worst-case scenario to the best-case, Goldman Sachs stock chief David Kostin said. NYSE traderTIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesThe stock market rally since April's historic volatility may be getting ahead of itself. The blistering rally since April lows suggests investors think good news on the trade war is imminent.But tariffs will still be much higher than they were in the past, market experts warn. More than a month has passed since President Donald Trump's tariffs sparked chaos in financial markets, and there's been no news of a trade deal. But markets are acting like the trade war may already be won, and investors may be getting overly optimistic, market pros say. The S&P 500 is up 13% since closing at a low of 4,982 on April 8. While relatively upbeat earnings and robust macroeconomic data have helped stocks, commentators also say that the market is increasingly pricing in a swift end to trade tensions — and a win for Donald Trump and the US. But investors need to tread carefully when it comes to baking in assumptions about trade policy, market experts told Business Insider. \"No way you're going to make a deal in a couple of weeks. Now, maybe they'll come up with some sort of framework for negotiation that could one day lead to a deal, and maybe Trump will, being the master marketer, claim some sort of victory if they achieve that. But actual trade deals? No, I don't think that's very likely,\" Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, said. Stocks are likely rising on \"buy-the-dip\" thinking among investors, who haven't seen a true bear market in more than a decade, Berezin said.Unless Trump significantly dials back tariffs over the next few weeks, he also thinks the economy will likely enter a \"deep slowdown,\" given the pressures tariffs will put on consumers.Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also thinks the rally since April is getting ahead of itself. He pointed to risks weighing on the US economy, such as inflation and downward growth risks stemming from trade policy.\"We're also still dealing with a situation where, despite the fact that there are these various talks and negotiations going on, concrete progress is still very, very thin on the ground,\" Brown told BI. Investors are particularly keen to see a trade agreement reached with China, but Brown also sees challenges there, given that neither China nor the US will want to be seen as the \"weaker party\" in negotiations.Brown predicted tariffs could come down but still be materially higher than anything that was in place before. He said he believes tariffs on China will ultimately be 50%-60%. Trump clarified in April that he intended to levy a 145% tariff on goods imported from ChinaChip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesStill, top commentators from around the market this week have said they see the US coming out on top, and that markets are positioning for that outcome. Kyle Bass, one of the investors featured in \"The Big Short,\" said in April that he believes the US has the upper hand in trade negotiations with China. That's because Beijing is likely feeling more pain from tariffs than the US, given the imbalance of trade between the two nations, with the US importing more from China than China imports from the US. \"We are the largest consuming nation in the world. Certainly, we can outlast China,\" Bass said.Kyle Bass said he believed the US would come out on top in trade negotiations with China.Reuters/Rick WilkingMeanwhile, David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said he believes markets have gone from pricing in one of the worst-case scenarios to the best-case with regard to tariffs. Based on the performance of cyclical stocks relative to defensive stocks, the market appears to be eyeing economic growth of more than 1% this year, Kostin told CNBC this week, higher than the bank's baseline forecast for GDP.\"The equity market is pricing really the very best outcome that we anticipate in our baseline forecast,\" Kostin said. \"Basically had that reverse in a matter of a week or two.\"The bargaining tableTrump, who implemented a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs after days of historic market volatility, has suggested that the US is making progress in trade negotiations, though no deals have been announced.The president has insisted negotiations are progressing without offering further details. \"Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?'\" Mr. Trump said, pointing to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. \"We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we wanted to. We don't have to sign deals.\"When questioned about progress on trade deals by reporters, he added: \"I wish they'd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week.\"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Monday that trade deals could come as soon as this week, as 17 of the US's top 18 trading partners had come forward with \"very good trade proposals.\"Regarding China, Bessent said he believed the two nations could \"see substantial progress in the coming weeks.\" The Treasury Secretary and other US officials are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland over the weekend.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Gains in silver prices have not matched gold's dizzying rally.Ravitaliy/Getty ImagesGains in silver prices are unlikely to catch up to the gold rally, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Central banks' gold demand has driven the gold-silver price ratio out of its historical range since 2022.Economic uncertainty is fuelling a gold rally. Meanwhile, silver prices face pressure from solar oversupply.Gold has been on a dizzying rally — but buying silver as an alternative may not be as profitable a move as you think.The yellow metal is likely to continue outperforming silver thanks to strong demand from central banks, which have been snapping up gold since 2022.\"The price divergence began after the freezing of Russian reserves, which triggered a fivefold increase in central bank gold buying — a shift that does not extend to the more ample and less precious silver,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note on Monday.Gold and silver prices are closely linked with the gold-silver price ratio, which measures the ounces of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold and historically trades in a 45-80 range.However, the ratio has broken out of this range since 2022 and is now around 102, which means that more silver is now required to buy an ounce of gold.\"Central banks broke a 40-year correlation,\" wrote the Goldman analysts.They don't expect silver prices to catch up with the gold rally as higher central bank gold demand has structurally lifted the gold-silver price ratio.While the war in Ukraine has lifted gold prices, prices have been on a tear since early 2024 as investors piled into haven assets.Over the last year, prices of the yellow metal have been supported by demand from China due to the country's economic downturn and broader uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's second term in office.Gold prices hit a historic high above $3,500 per ounce on April 22. Its price is around 28% higher this year to date.The spot gold price was around $3,370 per ounce at 3:08 a.m. ET on Tuesday after hitting a two-week high of $3,380 per ounce on Monday. Investors are keeping their eyes on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday for further cues.The spot silver price is around $33 per ounce and is about 15% higher so far this year.Meanwhile, a boom in China's solar panel production has also slowed, putting pressure on the prices of silver, which is used in its manufacturing.\"With Chinese solar production now slowing amid oversupply, high recession risk, and central bank gold buying remaining strong in 2025, we expect gold to continue outglittering silver,\" the analysts wrote.Goldman's year-end forecast for gold prices is $3,700 per ounce.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The experience of being a computer science student at a very technical university meant you spent most of your time in the basement of the engineering building doing your programming.I knew that the way I wanted to use my technology skills was really to apply them to real-world problems, where your technology would make a material difference toward a product or a business, where you could actually see the impact of your work in almost a real-time basis.When I ended up in financial services, I couldn't have been more pleased.

I was helping the firm manage risk and relationships with our clients. It was my responsibility to architect and build out a system that was nimble and could manage the complexities of these relationships and calculate money moving between counterparts. That responsibility became even more pronounced during times of volatility, and I was able to see firsthand how my work was pivotal in important times for the firm.Some projects involved enabling a new financial product that we could offer to our clients or operating our businesses in additional countries around the world.

I had built a lot of expertise through my work in finance that was very applicable to the tech industry, but at the same time, I thought I could learn something new through the lens of a technology company.The work I was focused on impacted the entire employee base of Google. We built and implemented the systems used by Googlers around the world, making sure people had what was needed to get their jobs done and the company had the systems in place to run it. So my work had a direct impact on the employees of Google and an indirect impact on the customers of Google.But I missed this sense of purpose toward very tangible business results —the volatility, the constant need to be nimble, responsive, and reactive.Arguably, I couldn't put that same kind of art and finesse to work at Google in the way that I have the opportunity to within financial services.The reality is — and I remind folks of this when they try to make the comparison — that tech and finance have a different set of products and a different environment. Financial services is an industry where tech is a differentiator to the success of the business; at a company like Google, tech is the business.How to handle the rate of changeI'm thrilled to be here. But it's hard.The pace and rate of change are exceptional. How technology is evolving, the opportunities to bring AI and automation and different kinds of efficiency elements to what we do and how we do it (every couple of weeks there's something new and different), how we challenge ourselves to be at the forefront of these things — it's exhausting, right?It's an amazing time to be an engineer, but it's a lot of responsibility to do it well and stay nimble enough to respond and react to the changes that are out there.There is no question AI will be a material part of our journey for the next decades, and for someone like me, it will involve being on the front lines of maximizing the technology to help our people better serve our clients.Already, we are seeing a roughly 20% increase in efficiency depending on the developer and the use case. One of the most impactful ways we can use it is to take the toil out of the tasks that we would rather not have our best and brightest minds working on and instead have them work on designing new products. We're going to ask some individuals on our teams to do different things, but it's more about evolving their role than a flat-out completely different way of operating.I believe engineers will maintain their creative role in designing systems and architectures. As technology evolves, they will still act as the conductor in an orchestra of additional instruments.I think we're only scratching the surface of what opportunities we'll be able to realize through it.Want to share your career path with us?

        "description": "Tail-risk scenarios that threaten the stability of the US could send gold prices soaring 36% to $4,500 by the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said. Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs recommends investors buy gold as recession risks remain high.Gold is preferred over Treasurys for hedging the risk of US government instability. Central banks' dollar diversification efforts should also boot gold demand, Goldman said. Investors should buy gold as the stock market continues to underprice the risk of a recession later this year.That's according to Goldman Sachs, who said in a note on Tuesday that gold, even after its 26% year-to-date surge, could zoom past its price target of $3,700.\"We recommend that investors hedge still elevated cyclical recession risk with oil puts and long gold positions,\" Goldman Sachs' Daan Struyven said.Beware of a recessionDespite the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause, \"the chances of recession remains unusually high,\" Struyven warned.The analyst said that the stock market's sharp rebound since its April low also leaves little upside to be had for risk assets, even if trade relations between the US and China improve.\"The level of policy uncertainty remains very high, businesses and consumers expect very weak activity, real income growth is likely to compress, financial conditions remain tighter than a few months ago, and US production disruptions are plausible,\" Struyven said.Investors got their first taste of an economic slowdown on Wednesday, with first-quarter GDP growth coming in at -0.4%.If a recession does strike, Goldman says the S&P 500 could plunge 16% from current levels to $4,600.Gold is a better hedge than TreasurysStruyven prefers gold as a portfolio hedge for investors as compared to Treasurys because Treasurys haven't been providing as much protection against stock market sell-offs as they used to.\"Longer-dated US Treasuries and USD longs—may continue to fail protecting against equity risk,\" Struyven said.Part of the problem is that in recent weeks, typical safe haven assets like Treasurys and the US dollar have been acting like emerging market assets amid the Trump administration's chaotic tariff policies and threats against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\"The unusual 'EM-style correlations' (equities down/yields higher/USD down) that we have seen recently are a clear signal that markets are concerned about what recent policy actions imply about US governance and institutional credibility,\" Struyven explained.As investors choose gold over Treasurys to protect their portfolios, the shiny metal could surge past $3,700 and to as high as $4,800 by mid-2026, representing potential upside of 12% and 21%, respectively.And in a tail-risk scenarios, in which there are unprecedented risks to the stability of the Federal Reserve or drastic changes in US reserve policy, gold could soar as high as 36% to $4,500 by the end of the year.A long-term reason to be bullish on goldAside from the short-term risks to the economy and stock market, Struyven said there are long-term reasons to be bullish on the metal.One reason is the trend of diversification among central banks around the world, as countries seek to hedge their exposure to a depreciating dollar and limit holdings of an asset that can be subject to extreme sanctions, as Russia has experienced since its invasion of Ukraine.\"The diversification out of dollar reserves in the official sector and the associated fivefold increase in central bank purchases of gold since 2022 has driven the bulk of the 76% gold rally since the freezing of Russia's reserves in 2022,\" Struyven said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The tariff-fueled drop in stocks would be relatively mild compared to what the market could see if recession strikes, Goldman Sachs said. Xinhua/Wang Ying via Getty ImagesStocks have enjoyed a big rebound from April's historic sell-off, but investors might not be out of the woods. Analysts and commentators have pointed to a handful of reasons the market could be headed for more pain. But technical and economic indicators suggest upside will be limited, according to Wall Street forecasters.Stocks have clawed back most of their losses since Trump's trade war sparked a historic sell-off, but the rally is at risk of disruption, according to Wall Street pros.Despite the S&P 500's rally in recent weeks, there is a growing number of indicators that suggest the market is steering into fresh headwinds, forecasters say. The benchmark index has gained 11% since its low on April 8, the day stocks capped off a 12% decline spurred by Trump's April 2 reciprocal tariffs announcement.Here are some of the warning signs for stocks market experts see on the horizon. 1. Bearish technical indicatorsThe market is flashing technical signals that suggest a more challenging backdrop for equity prices.The S&P 500, for one, is nearing two key resistance levels: the index's 50-day and 200-day moving averages.In the past, when the S&P 500 is already in a downtrend and nearing those levels, that's led to more pressure on equity prices, as the decline in the moving averages suggests that sellers are overwhelming buyers in the market.Jeff deGraaf, the head of technical research at Renaissance Macro, also pointed to how stocks have clawed back more than 50% of their peak-to-trough decline since Liberation Day.\"That's kind of the natural level that you would expect to see some type of resistance,\" he said of the 50% gain, speaking to CNBC on Tuesday. \"We've got a few overbought indications.\"\"I think this is a bear market rally. I think we rally another 3%-4%, and I think we've got some struggles ahead of us,\" deGraaf added. \"All of our trend work has shifted and moved bearish.\"2. Recession riskStocks could be under more pressure if the US ends up tipping into a downturn, according to Goldman Sachs.GDP, a measure of economic growth, declined 0.3% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department, the first time the economy has contracted since 2022. Economic activity isn't likely to bottom from tariffs until the third quarter of this year, per Goldman's forecast.When stocks bottomed in early April, the S&P 500 was down 19% from its peak in February. Yet, when compared to past recessions, a 19% drawdown in the benchmark index would be relatively mild, the bank said, suggesting that the market could see more downside if the economy were to enter a recession.Goldman Sachs is forecasting a 45% chance the economy will enter a recession in the next 12 months. JPMorgan and other Wall Street firms have also recently lifted their recession forecasts, citing tariffs as a key factor.\"We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying 'shock' has passed,\" analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.3. Tariff uncertaintyA lot of unknowns are still swirling around Trump's trade policy. All of the tariffs Trump announced in early April are still on the table, even though they've been delayed. And while the US appeared to be making progress on talks with China, Trump appeared to stand his ground on the tariffs he originally levied this week when speaking to ABC News, stating that China was \"ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off.\"If anything, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs appears to be only deepening, according to Chris Toomey, managing director of Morgan Stanley's private wealth arm.\"Our view is we're kind of range-bound right now. We're probably at the top of the range,\" Toomey said, speaking to CNBC on Tuesday. \"From our standpoint, we wouldn't necessarily be buying here. We'd probably be kind of buying more at the lower ends of these ranges.\"Toomey said Morgan Stanley's team would need more certainty on tariffs on China to turn positive on equities. He added that the firm was also looking for more dovish signals on interest rates from the Fed, the 10-year US Treasury yield dropping below 4% without a recession, and strength in corporate earnings.\"Look, until we get some real clarity on a couple of different issues, I don't think we're really necessarily going to get very bullish on equities.\"\"We wouldn't be surprised if the index retested its lows as additional uncertainties create headwinds,\" Scott Wren, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"US and international leaders are posturing with moves and countermoves, which only leave investors with more questions.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs' Marco Argenti, Ashish Shah, and Kerry BlumGoldman SachsGoldman Sachs has been deepening its investments in generative artificial intelligence.CEO David Solomon has said the bank's AI tools will \"scale and transform our engineering abilities.\"Seven Goldman employees, from analyst to partner, told BI how AI is changing their jobs.A few years ago, what excited one of Wall Street's top tech bosses about artificial intelligence was its potential to serve as an infinite repository of facts. He even likened its advent to the printing press.Now, Marco Argenti, the chief information officer at Goldman Sachs, is bullish about the tech's growing analytical and reasoning powers, too.\"It is like the ultimate librarian that knows how to find the information,\" he told Business Insider in a recent interview. He said that AI's reasoning capabilities have reached the point of helping users analyze and synthesize conclusions.It's not just mundane tasks that can be outsourced to AI anymore, but even intricate problems that Argenti predicted will one day be solved by \"teams\" of human and digital brains.That deepening degree of analytical ability has prompted a shift in how Goldman's other leaders have come to think about AI, and spawned a suite of new products. Under Argenti's leadership, the bank has introduced generative AI-powered resources built using the AI platform Goldman launched in mid-2024. That foundation was engineered with access to popular large language models like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, but includes a protective layer to insulate the firm's confidential data.Goldman has since produced a range of tools, from a developer copilot for writing code, to a language translator, to its interactive \"GS AI Assistant\" — an AI sidekick for employees resembling the kind of chat interface that ChatGPT operates for its own everyday users.During the bank's April earnings call, CEO David Solomon told shareholders that these tools, including the GS AI Assistant, promised \"to scale and transform our engineering capabilities.\"It's now available to roughly 10,000 members of the firm's more than 46,000-person-strong workforce, with the goal of expanding it to most others by the end of the year. The rollout comes as financial firms, including other banks, start to see cost and time savings from their AI investments. Case in point: Solomon has said that AI is doing 95% of the work on an IPO prospectus.With AI's reach in finance only accelerating, some in the industry have openly worried about threats from the tech, like job redundancies and cost savings. Nonetheless, it's won over some devotees — like these seven Goldman employees, ranging from analyst to partner, who shared real-life depictions with BI of how they're making it work for them.Their vignettes offer a picture of how AI is changing life in finance.Ashish Shah, partner and chief investment officer of public investing, asset and wealth managementAshish Shah, partner and chief investment officer of public investing, asset wealth management, Goldman SachsGoldman SachsEven though he's a senior leader in the firm's public investing business and among its top executives as a Goldman partner, Shah still welcomes help presenting his thoughts and opinions.\"With more analytical people, generative AI is really helpful as a starting point with some of the more creative aspects of their jobs,\" Shah told BI. \"The GS AI Assistant helps get me to a first draft quickly. Once I have that first draft to react to, I have all sorts of opinions and can iterate easily from there.\"It allows him to brainstorm and structure concepts he wants to get across and organize those specific threads \"in a pithy manner,\" he said.When Shah used AI to help structure a strategic discussion for an upcoming business on-site trip, he said it shortened \"what could have taken three to five hours,\" and boiled \"it down into 30 minutes of back and forth with the LLM.\"\"That kind of time saving,\" he added, \"is incredibly valuable.\"Kerry Blum, partner and global head of the equity structuring group, asset and wealth managementKerry Blum, partner and global head of the equity structuring group within private wealth managementGoldman SachsWorking with some of Goldman's wealthiest clients, like high-net worth individuals, family offices, and founders of companies, Blum's broader team talks with people all over the world.\"We're a global bank. Our clients are global. Our investment ideas are global,\" Blum said. \"So we want to meet our clients where they are, and while our reach is already global, we can enhance the way we engage with our clients by speaking to them in their preferred language.\"The bank is now expanding its Translate AI tool, which currently works with nine other languages, into the asset and wealth management division, Blum said.Historically, Goldman outsourced some of this translation work, and turnaround times could sometimes stretch into days, making time-sensitive updates challenging or impractical at times. With Translate AI, output is seconds or minutes, she added, allowing her teams to share more time-sensitive updates rather than stick to the more evergreen content with a longer shelf life.Raphaelle Jacquemin, managing director, global banking and marketsAlthough AI is new to Jacquemin's day-to-day toolkit, the managing director in equity derivatives structuring is already reaping the rewards.Specifically, Jacquemin uses the tools to help her with software, whether it's doing something complicated in Outlook or maneuvering through coding languages.\"For example, I can say, 'I want to create in Outlook a search folder where I have all the emails which are bigger than 2MB, unread, and older than 5 years old. Give me a tutorial on how to do this,'\" she explained.She's also found it valuable in breaking down programming languages, like Python. The London-based employee has asked AI to make sense of coding commands, like \"pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples,\" or suggest the best way to spin up tables of figures in Python.Christopher Dixon, vice president, global investment researchGoldman Sachs' Translate AI tool is also available to its investment research teams to translate a wide variety of reports into some languages.The content-management-group team has been using the LLM-based interface, which translates to and from English, for around nine months, said Dixon, a vice president at the bank. He said the firm has recorded a \"high double-digit improvement\" in productivity around translations, while also reducing translation outsourcing costs, he said, though the firm declined to offer specific figures.Samantha Boden, vice president, global banking and marketsGS AI AssistantGoldman SachsAs a quantitative strategist focused on risk modeling, Boden spends much of her time developing new ideas.\"While this is exciting, learning entirely new topics can be challenging,\" she said. So Boden has turned to the GS AI Assistant as her \"personal tutor,\" which has completely changed the way she approaches her daily work and masters technical topics.For instance, if Boden wanted to learn how to price an American call option, she said she can ask the AI a series of questions about pricing methods or an \"unsolved example to practice.\" If certain features are added, she can query how the model changes using the AI system, as well.\"The power lies not only in the AI's vast knowledge base but also in the speed of iteration,\" Boden said, adding that she can quickly request more details about a specific response, or personalize the learning experience.Konstantin Kuchenmeister, associate, engineeringGoldman Sachs' engineering coding assistant and the GS AI Assistant are quickly becoming the primary tools in Kuchenmeister's daily workflow.\"I use it every day for getting a head start on traditionally time-consuming tasks such as code writing and reviewing models, saving me hours every week,\" said Kuchenmeister, who is also an adjunct math professor at Columbia University.From routinely asking the tool to review team members' code changes, to running a line-by-line analysis to flag potential vulnerabilities, Kuchenmeister said he has started treating the GS AI Assistant \"as both a collaborative tool and colleague.\"The AI assistant has also shaved time off the weekly updates, routine project plans, and presentation decks Kuchenmeister has to put together. Recently, he prompted it to prepare the monthly update presentation he gives, while telling it to keep the draft under three pages, bearing in mind notes from the prior week's meeting, and to format everything like a bulleted list.\"It responded with a near-final version in less than a minute,\" he said.Samruddhi Somwanshi, analyst, engineeringSoftware engineers across corporate America are increasingly turning to AI for coding help.Nitat Termmee/Getty ImagesAs one of the firm's newest recruits, Somwanshi, who holds the entry-level role of analyst, turns to AI to save time navigating the bank's vast codebase. She also uses the bank's AI tools to write test cases quickly, explain specific parts of code, and document changes made to the code.It's a new world for engineering analysts like her — just a few years ago, time-consuming tasks like these would have mostly been done by hand.\"Sometimes I just describe what I want to do, and it helps by pointing me to the right files or functions I should check for,\" she said. \"It might sound like a small thing, but doing this every day really adds up and makes my work as a developer much smoother,\" Somwanshi continued, adding: \"It's been a huge time-saver.\"And as an analyst and newbie to Goldman's hard-charging culture, every second on the job can count.Have a tip?

OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said the startup is building an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can do all the work of software engineers, not just augment their skills, during a wide-ranging interview at a recent Goldman Sachs conference. “This is not just augmenting the current software engineers in your workforce, which is kind of what we can do today through Copilot, but instead, it’s literally an agentic software engineer that can build an app for you,” Friar said at the Disruptive Technology Symposium in London. “Not only does it build it, it does all the things that software engineers hate to do” such as quality assurance tests, bug testing and bashing, as well as the accompanying documentation, she said. “So suddenly, you can force multiply your software engineering workforce.” This agentic software engineer is called “A-SWE” and represents the third phase of OpenAI’s development of agentic AI — systems that work independently on behalf of users. Last year, Cognition AI was the first to release an AI software engineer. Devin could plan and execute complex engineering tasks, and it can use common developer tools within a gated environment, “everything a human would need to do their work,” the startup said. OpenAI’s A-SWE is its third agentic tool, with the first two being Deep Research, which creates comprehensive research reports, and Operator, which performs web-based tasks like booking travel or making dinner reservations, according to Friar. The next phase of AI agents would extend human knowledge to create something truly novel the world hasn’t seen yet. Friar said academics are telling OpenAI that AI models are “coming up with novel things in their field. They don’t yet know if those novel things are real, because they now need to go and test” and see if it’s a new discovery. Friar also revealed that GPT-4.5, OpenAI’s most advanced GPT model, was trained to have more EQ — emotional quotient or intelligence — not just technical skills. “We’re actually spending a bunch of time thinking about the more EQ side of models,” Friar said. “We spent a lot more time training (GPT-4.5) to have what Silicon Valley loves to call vibes, but effectively EQ.” She described the model as feeling “very human” and “actually better for things like design or writing or creative concepts, rather than just pure hard math and science.” While overall viewing AI coworkers as a good thing, human workers remain cautious. A January PYMNTS Intelligence report, “GenAI: A Generational Look at AI Usage and Attitudes,” shows more than half of survey respondents think AI poses a “significant risk” of widespread job displacement.

Initial tech partners are Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and OpenAI. Friar compared OpenAI’s infrastructure investment to Amazon’s strategic decision to develop AWS rather than outsourcing cloud computing to competitors. “Think about Amazon, at that moment where they’re rocking it on eCommerce, they see AWS starting to take shape. If at that stage they decided to go outsource to the upstart Google or something, giving all that IP of AWS away, think about how different the company would be today,” she said. Despite OpenAI’s technological breakthroughs, Friar acknowledged that computing limitations remain its biggest constraint. Stargate is designed to ensure the startup will always have enough computing power. It was lack of computing power that delayed OpenAI’s models in the past, Friar said. For example, the release of OpenAI’s video generation model Sora was delayed by nearly a year because the company didn’t have enough computing power to handle user requests. Stargate is expected to help solve the problem of inadequate computing power. It should yield 10 gigawatts, which would exceed the entire electrical consumption of Ireland (seven gigawatts). Such investments are critical since OpenAI is growing fast. Friar said OpenAI has tripled its revenue each year for three consecutive years, with 400 million weekly active users currently on its platform. Looking ahead, Friar indicated that while an IPO isn’t imminent given the startup’s development and expansion plans, it remains a future possibility. “I can’t even imagine that right now — so much going on,” she said. At some point it will be considered since “being a public company is good hygiene.” The post OpenAI Developing AI Agent to Replace Software Engineers, CFO Says appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Goldman strategists raised their forecast by $400 to $3,700 an ounce by the end of 2025, arguing gold was \"uniquely positioned to hedge recession risk.\" The price of gold keeps rising this year.Doug Armand/Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs raised its 2025 gold price forecast by $400 to $3,700.Gold has surged this year as investors seek safe havens amid tariff-induced uncertainty.UBS and Bank of America predict gold prices will reach $3,500 in 2025.Gold is having a stellar year — and its surge may not be over yet.Goldman Sachs raised its overall price forecast by $400 to $3,700 an ounce by the end of the year.Lina Thomas, a commodities strategist at the bank, and Daan Struyven, cohead of global commodities research, said in a note on Friday they expected gold to trade in a range between $3,650 to $3,950, up from $3,250 to $3,520.The increase was based on stronger-than-expected central bankdemand and a boost from increased recession risk. The Goldman analysts said that stresses in bond markets \"increase our conviction that gold is uniquely positioned to hedge recession risk.\"The bank's economists say there's a 45% chance of a US recession in the next 12 months. If that happens, the analysts said gold could hit $3,880 by the end of the year — or even as much as $4,500 under certain scenarios.It comes after gold reached another record high of $3,245 on Friday, after losing ground in the days following the announcement of President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 2. Goldman put the dip down to investors liquidating gold \"to meet margin calls\" in last week's stock market selloff.Gold regained momentum as investors seek out safe-haven assets, which typically maintain or increase their value during market turbulence. It's hit a number of records this year, passing the $3,000 threshold for the first time last month.At the end of last week, UBS analysts raised their 2025 gold price target to $3,500, citing \"escalating tariff uncertainty, weaker growth, higher inflation and lingering geopolitical risks.\" Bank of America also has a price target of $3,500.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The dollar weakened to a six-month low on concern that the confusion around the Trump administration’s tariff policy will drive traders away from US assets. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index rallied, while futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 advanced at least 1.5%. Apple shares jumped in premarket trading. Trump doubled down on the plan Sunday. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said in a social media post Sunday. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe.

Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his tariffs on Wednesday, during which the US will implement a 10% universal tariff on imports./Alex BrandonThere's a growing chance that the steep correction in stocks keeps going, Goldman Sachs said.The bank said the risk of further downside climbed past 35%, even as Trump hit pause on tariffs.The risk of a stock correction has remained elevated since January, analysts said in a note.Donald Trump's tariff pause probably isn't enough to stem a deeper correction in the stock market, Goldman Sachs said.Already, stocks on Thursday were giving back a chunk of the gains recorded in Wednesday's historic session. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say they still see an \"elevated\" risk that stocks will fall even further, even after the significant drawdown in the market in recent weeks and despite Trump dialing back most of his tariffs on Wednesday.Goldman Sach's equity drawdown risk model, which bases its probability of further market downside on a handful of indicators, recently spiked past 35% on both a three-month and 12-month horizon. That's a strong signal that the S&P 500 is headed for further declines, the bank wrote in a note, adding that the model's downside risk has been elevated since January.The risk of further downside in stocks has climbed past 35% on both a 3-month and 12-month horizonHaver Analytics/Datastream/Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\"Usually levels above 35% give a strong signal of downside risk to equities, and probabilities for both 3m and 12m are now above those levels, especially when applying our economists' bearish macro baseline,\" analysts wrote. \"As we showed previously, historically, a higher equity drawdown probability has translated into lower forward returns for equities and the risk fo deeper max drawdowns.\"Analysts pointed to several factors that have raised the risk of more downside.For one, leading growth indicators in the economy have declined. In particular, the bank pointed to the recent decline in manufacturing activity as an example, with new orders and production measures contracting over the month of March, according to the Institute of Supply Management.Also, recent market volatility has also hurt the outlook for stocks. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the stock market's fear gauge, has declined slightly since Trump first implemented reciprocal tariffs but remains elevated compared to levels at the start of the year.Policy uncertainty also remains high. The US Economic Uncertainty Index, one measure of unpredictability, spiked to a level of 689 on Wednesday, according to Federal Reserve data, down from a peak 992 in April, but still elevated on a historical basis.Downside risk also looks like it hasn't yet peaked, according to Goldman's projections.\"Before a clear peak in the equity drawdown probabilities, risk of further corrections remains elevated in the near term. The size of the drawdown does not lower near-term drawdown risk,\" analysts said.Goldman Sachs rescinded its recession forecast after Trump paused most reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, but the bank still thinks there's a 45% chance the economy could tip into a downturn next year.Previously, analysts said they saw the S&P 500 dropping as low as 4,600 in a full downturn scenario, which implies the index dropping another 13% from levels on Thursday, or a 25% drop from its February all-time high. Concerns around tariffs have weighed significantly on Wall Street's outlook in recent weeks. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and RBC are among the big banks who have cut their forecast for stocks, citing the trade war as a major headwind for equity prices.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Goldman Sachs Group economists reportedly issued a note predicting a recession due to new U.S. tariffs and then retracted that forecast a little over an hour later after President Donald Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs. This happened Wednesday (April 9) and reflected the challenges analysts and investors face in making decisions as the administration’s trade policy evolves, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. In its initial note, the Goldman Sachs team said there was a 65% chance of a recession in the next 12 months due to the tariffs that went into effect Monday morning, according to the report. The team issued that note shortly before 1 p.m. in New York. Trump announced the pause in a post on Truth Social at 1:18 p.m., and the Goldman team reversed its call in another note at 2:10 p.m., the report said. “Earlier today, before President Trump’s announcement, we had shifted to a recession baseline in response to the additional country-specific tariffs that went into effect this morning,” the second note from Goldman Sachs said, per the report. “We are now reverting to our previous non-recession baseline forecast.” Trump said in his post on Truth Social that while he was raising the tariff charged to China by 125%, he was pausing those imposed on other countries. “Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” Trump wrote. Amid the evolving trade policies, chief financial officers face the imperative to potentially “rightsize” their operations and embrace new import or manufacturing strategies, PYMNTS reported Wednesday. As global trade becomes more complex and politically fraught, CFOs are stepping beyond traditional finance functions to become architects of global supply chain strategy.

The bank's forecasts were walked back an hour after Trump dialed back most tariffs on Wednesday.The bank now sees a 45% chance the economy could tip into recession in the next year.The wild trade war saga is causing recession forecasts to whipsaw at one of Wall Street's top banks. Goldman Sachs waffled on its recession call on Wednesday, with analysts raising their predicted probability of a recession for the third time before slashing their new forecast in the afternoon after Trump announced a 90-day pause and walked back most of his recently unveiled reciprocal tariffs.The bank now sees a 45% probability of a recession in the next year, the same odds analysts originally predicted last week.Trump isn't canceling all of his proposed tariffs. After the 90-day reprieve, the White House will impose a 10% universal tariff on all countries. The administration is also lifting China's tariff rate to 125%, according to a post from Trump on Truth Social on Wednesday.President Donald Trump announced that Chinese goods would now be subject to a 125% tariff, a further escalation in his trade war with China.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesStill, the newest tariff plan is more in line with what Goldman originally anticipated for Trump's trade policy, the bank said in a note, explaining why it was cutting its recession probability from 65% back to 45%.\"As a result, we are reverting to our non-recession baseline forecast with GDP growth of 0.5% and a 45% probability of recession,\" analysts wrote an hour after most tariffs were lifted.Last week, Goldman raised its 12-month probability of a recession from 35% to 45%. Analysts said the bank intended to change its baseline forecast to a recession if Trump implemented his new tariffs on Wednesday.Early Wednesday, as Trump's new tariffs swung into effect, the bank raised its 12-month recession probability to 65%, adding that they believed it was \"unlikely\" that the White House would quickly reverse most of the tariffs.The bank expected the overall US tariff rate to rise by at least 20 percentage points, given the tariffs Trump originally implemented on Wednesday. With the reduced 10% tariff, it now expects the overall US tariff rate to rise 15 percentage points, it added.Goldman isn't the only one feeling the whiplash. Stocks were in choppy waters Wednesday before staging a stunning reversal and rallying 9% after Trump announced the tariff reprieve. The Dow rose more than 2,700 points and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12%, its biggest gain since 2008. Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "\"Historical comparisons show that recessions are usually associated with larger equity drawdowns than we have seen,\" Goldman Sachs said. Stocks have teetered at the edge of a bear market since Trump revealed sweeping tariffs on April 2.TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesThe trade war has caused recession fears to spike and stocks to tumble. The S&P 500 would drop about 7% from current levels in a full recession, Goldman Sachs estimates.\"Historical comparisons show that recessions are usually associated with larger equity drawdowns than we have seen.\"The stock market has teetered at the edge of a bear market since tariffs were unveiled last week, but investors should brace for deeper losses if a recession strikes. In a note published on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts said that the S&P 500 would fall as low as 4,600 in a full downturn scenario, based on historical averages. The forecast implies another 7% drop from levels on Wednesday, and a 25% drop from the index's February 19 closing high.Wall Street is becoming increasingly concerned about a recession. JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon is the latest among top voices warning of a tariff-induced slowdown, saying this week that a recession is \"a likely outcome\" amid the deepening global trade war. Investors are taking note of the possibility, predicting that the Federal Reserve could be forced to cut interest rates to keep the economy running. According to CME FedWatch Tool data, markets expect a 100-basis-point reduction by the end of the year.As confidence wanes, the market has seen a large chunk of the gains recorded in 2024 vaporized, with the S&P 500 down around 14% in less than a week. With the tariffs now in effect, Goldman said a recession is its baseline forecast.Yet investors still might not be pricing it in. \"We think 200bp of cuts are a reasonable baseline for a recession in the current set-up, and recessionary easing cycles typically begin with at least a 50bp reduction,\" Goldman said. Goldman Sachs\"Historical comparisons show that recessions are usually associated with larger equity drawdowns than we have seen and much larger declines in the Fed funds rate than are priced.\"Other recession indicators aren't meeting the moment, either. Neither long-dated equity volatility, credit spreads, nor the yield curve have moved meaningfully in response to higher odds of a recession.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "As one of the world’s leading charity auctioneers and a seasoned keynote speaker for companies like Goldman Sachs and Google, I have spent 80 to 100 nights on stage every year for over two decades. Since I am typically one of the last people to take the stage at a fundraising event, I have watched countless people in various stages of panic just moments before they go on stage. After they find out my role, I usually receive a predictable set of rapid-fire questions from upcoming speakers in the hopes that some last-minute tips from a pro can help them do more than keep from passing out when they hit the stage. Here are five things I tell people in the final moments before they take the stage to help them walk out looking and feeling confident, collected, and ready to rock the room. Reframe Your Story It doesn’t matter how many times you go on stage; you will still get an adrenaline rush in the final moments before you walk out. Instead of thinking of that shaky, nervous, finger-tingling sensation as nerves, think of it as energy that you will bring to the room. You want to fire up the audience? You need that energy. The next time you start worrying that your nerves are going to get the best of you, reframe the narrative: “This energy is going to fire me up, and I’m going to use it to fire up the audience.” Find Your “Strike Method” When I first started taking auctions, I realized that to calm my nerves and center my focus, I needed a solid routine. I decided to start every auction in the same way; banging down my gavel three times before I launch into selling. This movement allows me to channel my nerves into one action that grabs the audience’s attention at the same time. I also came to understand that this personal routine – which I’ve since dubbed my “Strike Method” – had an unexpected benefit. By doing the same thing every single time, I took away the guesswork. Now, every time I go on stage, I know the gavel will go down. This predictability allows me to focus on other things beyond myself, like strategically garnering bids and engaging with an audience that wants to be entertained. To define your own “Strike Method”, look for something that feels authentic to you. Is there a mantra, a phrase, a physical movement that helps you focus and bring yourself to a point of strength? Spend time figuring out what you can do and do it every single time you get onstage. Own the room The first seven seconds of any presentation are the most important because seven seconds is how long it takes for people to make up their mind about you. You want to grab their attention in those seven seconds and keep them focused on you. When you are walking to the place where you present, whether it be a podium, center stage, or among the crowd, you want all eyes on you. Keep your shoulders back, make sure your eyes are level, and make eye contact with people as you walk out with purpose. Do not slouch, cower in fear, or look down at the ground – that will only make people fearful that your speech or presentation will be painful to listen to and even more painful to watch! Sell as yourself When you get on stage, do everything you can to act as natural as possible. An audience can sense when someone is “playing a part” which can immediately turn them off as it seems fake and, quite frankly, boring. Use your own words, your own voice, and communicate in a way that feels authentic to you. Now is not the time to try on a new character. Authenticity will always win on stage and in life so be yourself and sell your message as the trustworthy communicator that you are. The audience wants you to succeed Never forget that the people sitting in front of you are rooting for you—they are your biggest cheering section. The audience doesn’t want to sit through an hour-long presentation with a terrible speaker. They want you to do a great job. Get on stage ready to give them a great show and they will be asking for you to come back every single time!",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs expects a 30% decline in the stock market, which would send the S&P 500 to about 4,300, or 18% lower from current levels. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIThe S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on Monday, dropping 21% from its February peak.The market plunge was driven by Trump's widening of the trade war last week. Event-driven bear markets can quickly shift to cyclical bear markets if the economy slows.The S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on Monday, falling 21% from its mid-February peak.The uncertainty of President Trump's tariffs, which Wall Street views as much higher than initially thought, plunged the market into chaos over the past week.An increase in market volatility has strategists at Goldman Sachs dusting off their bear market playbook and examining the various paths stocks can take based on historical trends.Here's what to expect if the stock market decisively enters bear market territory.There are 3 types of bear marketsStructural, cyclical, and event-driven are the three types of bear markets that stocks could fall into. Goldman argues that the market is currently flirting with an event-driven bear market, given that tariffs were the key catalyst to spark the recent plunge, with the S&P 500 immediately declining 10% after Trump announced his tariff list.\"This could be seen as self-inflicted, given the strong prospects for global economic activity at the start of the year, particularly in the US, where our economists put the probability of recession at just 15%,\" Goldman Sachs said.The odds of a recession striking the US economy this year have since risen past 50%, according to betting markets and various economists.Furthermore, Goldman said that an event-driven bear market could easily turn into a cyclical bear market if the economy materially slows down.How deep could the sell-off go?If the S&P 500 closes down 20% from its peak and officially triggers a bear market, there could be more pain ahead.According to the bank, the average event-driven and cyclical bear market experiences a decline of about 30%.\"On that basis, we would expect further downside,\" Goldman Sachs said. \"Very low unemployment (which is likely to rise) and elevated valuation suggests that markets are still vulnerable to the downside.\"A peak-to-trough decline of 30% would send the S&P 500 to about 4,300, or about 18% lower from current levels.Goldman SachsHow long could a bear market last?If an event-driven bear market strikes, the decline and eventual rebound could be quick.Goldman highlighted that this type of stock market decline tends to last about eight months, with a full recovery seen in about a year.But if this event-driven shock to the stock market transforms into a cyclical bear market, it could last a lot longer; the decline would last about two years, and it would take five years to fully rebound.Goldman SachsDon't be fooled by bear market ralliesSome of the strongest rallies in the stock market have historically occurred during bear market sell-offs.That's potentially what's on display on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 surging 4% after its brutal three-day sell-off.\"Given the very sharp falls in investor sentiment over the past few days, it would be typical for there to be a bounce in equity prices,\" Goldman Sachs said.Strong bear market rallies are driven by light investor positioning, meaning it only takes a little bit of buying, combined with little selling, to drive markets a lot higher on a given day.Ultimately, bear market rallies could last weeks before continuing their downtrend to new lows, with the average bear market rally lasting 44 days and returning 13%.The 4 ingredients for a recoveryFor a bear market in stocks to fully recover and transition into a bull market, four conditions need to materialize.Valuations need to be attractiveBearish positioning among investors needs to hit extremesPolicy support from the Fed or the governmentA positive outlook for economic growthAccording to Goldman, those conditions have not yet been met , with valuations remaining expensive, no indication of support from the Fed or Congress, investor positioning still not at extremes, and growth expectations not improving.Goldman Sachs\"It remains premature to expect growth momentum to bottom. Equity markets are particularly sensitive to the higher-frequency survey data, which remain very weak. The near-term earnings season is also likely to be weak,\" Goldman said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Stocks are melting down across the globe, and US market leadership is in jeopardy. But clients of Goldman Sachs Asset Management aren't panicking. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesGlobal equities are getting shelled at the fastest rate in years.Some investors are acting like this is the beginning of the end of US market leadership.However, clients of Goldman Sachs Asset Management are skeptical of that premise.Wall Street is in shambles after President Donald Trump announced highly aggressive tariffs, which one analyst remarked were \"worse than the worst-case scenario.\"US stocks are taking their heaviest losses since the onset of the pandemic five years ago. Major investment firms now say that barring a sudden policy shift, it will be hard to avoid a recession.But although markets are melting down, not everyone is sprinting for the exits.Leading minds at Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) said at their April 3 media day that their clients are taking a wait-and-see approach to US equities after Trump unveiled tariffs.\"We're getting a lot of inquiries, but not a lot of dollars are flowing,\" Elizabeth Burton, a senior client investment strategist at GSAM, said at the conference regarding US stock outflows.These high-net-worth investors may be struggling to cope with the idea that US equities' dominant 16-year run could end, even though international stocks have consistently led in 2025.\"Because they are long-term investors, there's still some belief that even if things look murky in the US, the US has done great by them,\" Burton said. \"The US may end up better than other countries on the other side of the tariffs that may suffer more.\"A world of painTariffs at the levels Trump outlined would crush the global economy, GSAM's leaders said.\"We view this as a growth shock,\" Ashish Shah, GSAM's chief investment officer of public investing, said of tariffs. \"You can view it as a tax on consumers, and to the extent that other countries impose tariffs on US goods, that's also a tax. So that ends up being contractionary.\"Even more frightening is that tariffs drive prices higher, which could create a dreaded stagflation scenario where economic growth falters and price growth takes off.\"The big word of 'stagflation' is real here. These tariffs will be inflationary,\" said Lindsay Rosner, GSAM's head of multi-asset fixed income. She estimates that Trump's tariffs would add about two percentage points to the inflation rate.A key rationale for Trump's trade war is that the US has trade deficits with much of the world, meaning that it imports more foreign goods than it exports its own products. Tariffs disrupt this exchange process, which will be a net negative for all — but other nations could be hit hardest.\"When the US runs a deficit — by definition, if the US slows down, the negative impact to the rest of the world is greater than the US is itself,\" Shah said.No major economy could escape the ripple effects of an economic downturn in the US, warned Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, GSAM's co-head of multi-asset solutions.\"Should there be a US recession, and the US sneezes, the rest of the world will be in bed with the flu,\" Wilson-Elizondo said in written commentary sent to Business Insider on Friday morning.Is US market leadership on its last legs?Although US stocks are taking on water, there are a few possible reasons why GSAM clients aren't jumping overboard yet.While most investors despite tariffs, some believe in Trump's unorthodox plan to use tariffs as a negotiating tactic to score better trade terms, or to bring manufacturing back to the US for good.\"At the heart of the market debate is one camp who believes that this is the unwind of US exceptionalism,\" Wilson-Elizondo remarked. \"And another camp that believes that the short-term actions of the Administration are the cost of maintaining a long-term advantage, and consequently, permanence in US exceptionalism.\"Other investors are staying the course because, as Burton noted, US stocks have consistently outperformed since the financial crisis, even through the most dire circumstances.Perhaps the most compelling explanation for why GSAM clients aren't quitting the US is that there isn't a compelling alternative — at least not within equities. As Shah and Wilson-Elizondo pointed out, international markets may suffer even more than their US counterparts.When deciding whether to reshape a portfolio centered around US stocks, there are two crucial — and perhaps contradictory — variables to consider: valuations and earnings growth.Note that \"EMU\" refers to Europe (the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union).Yardeni ResearchUS stocks have traded at a massive premium to the rest of the world for the last decade or so, according to Yardeni Research. The gap has narrowed this year, but it's still a significant chasm.Yardeni ResearchHowever, that discrepancy stems from the fact that US companies have produced much more consistent and strong earnings growth. Their profit margins also lap those of European firms, reinforcing the notion that American stocks are of higher quality, and therefore worth a premium.Note that \"EMU\" refers to Europe (the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union).Yardeni ResearchInvestors now must decide what's most at risk in the coming economic storm: expensive stocks, or those with lower-quality earnings.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Ilya Gaysinskiy, CTO of Point72Point72Ilya Gaysinskiy, chief technology officer at Point72, joined from Goldman Sachs in September 2024.His first priority is to hire more talent by building out its Poland hub and a new India office.In his first interview since joining Steve Cohen's fund, Gaysinskiy shares plans for talent and AI.It's not surprising that billionaire and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen likes to win. Upon meeting Cohen, Ilya Gaysinskiy's biggest takeaway was how key technology is to his $39 billion hedge fund's playbook.Gaysinskiy, a former Goldman Sachs leader who most recently oversaw one of the bank's largest technology groups, was intrigued and excited about the prospect of influencing Point72 as its chief technology officer. What won him over, though, was Cohen's \"earnest outlook\" that just having good technology isn't going to cut it, he told Business Insider.\"This is more about how you actually fundamentally grow and transform the business, and how fundamental it is to the future of this industry,\" he added.Point72 and its multistrategy rivals, all of which combine teams across the world trading different strategies into a single portfolio, have experienced explosive growth over the last few years as their steady returns lured in billions from investors. In his first interview since joining the hedge fund last September, Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization to meet and continue to drive the firm's expansion. Gaysinskiy formerly held a number of tech leadership positions at Goldman Sachs in core engineering and its consumer business.His first priority is to hire more talent by building out two tech hubs abroad and launching a college recruiting program to attract younger talent. He's kicking off a multi-year program aimed at improving the developer experience at Point72, an effort he drove at his former employer. The Columbia University alum, who spent 14 years at Goldman Sachs, also told us his plans to streamline parts of the software development process using automation and generative AI.From Poland to IndiaGaysinskiy has his sights set on India. In 2021, Point72 expanded into Warsaw, an office that now has more than 200 employees, many of which are technologists. Now the CTO wants to establish an Asian tech hub in Bengaluru.\"As Point72 continues to strengthen its presence as a global firm, so too does our technology organization,\" Gaysinskiy said. Establishing a \"follow-the-sun support model\" will be essential for meeting the rising demand for a connected financial system that never sleeps, he said.He pointed to the huge talent pool of engineers in India — where big banks like JPMorgan have large tech footprints, as do fellow hedge funds Millennium Management and Qube Research and Technologies. Point72 is in the early stages of that expansion, but Gaysinskiy said the goal is to have all technology disciplines represented in the India office, he said.Bangalore, India.Snehal Jeevan Pailkar/ShutterstockGaysinskiy said he's hiring across the spectrum, but he highlighted a \"huge focus\" on data, AI, and cybersecurity. The firm's career page currently has more than 70 open tech roles for software engineering and technical lead positions, mostly based in Warsaw, Stamford, and New York. Some positions offer a base annual salary of up to $300,000.In addition to expanding its tech reach globally, Gaysinskiy is also going after talent earlier in their careers. In his first few months at the fund, he oversaw Point72's kick-off of its first college recruiting program specifically for technology.\"Point72 is very well known for attracting and actually building talent in many ways, and I wanted to make sure that is true not just of the investment professionals and PMs, but also in technology,\" Gaysinskiy said.He pointed to the firm's ultra-competitive analyst training program and said this tech-focused version is a continuation of that development initiative. Gaysinskiy said he's eager to inject the firm with the energy typical of younger talent, their fresh skills in programming languages, engineering practices, and data science fundamentals, and for the opportunity to mold them.\"Setting a culture where engineers have the freedom to innovate, express their creativity toward the common purpose of building amazing solutions is super important,\" he said.Gaysinskiy is surveying the firm's tech population to get their input on their desired tooling and apps, how existing software development processes could be improved, and the environments they work in, such as the public cloud.One question asked respondents to, given a certain amount of money, allocate budget dollars to what they thought was important. He plans to do it annually.\"The idea is we want to actually start a systematic program where we actually are very data-driven around what needs improvement, what's working well,\" Gaysinskiy said.AI and the developer experienceThe hedge fund is after more than just budding technologists. One of Gaysinskiy's first big hires was Vladimir Zhukov, a machine learning whiz who will run the firm's AI and data platform.Before joining in January, Zhukov led various AI and machine learning efforts at Goldman Sachs, Stripe, and Amazon Web Services.Automation will be a key part of Gaysinskiy's strategy, given its potential to boost worker efficiency, reduce errors, and scale the business effectively.\"Ultimately, automation has the potential to free our developers to focus on higher-value, strategic work,\" he said.Gaysinskiy has seen firsthand the power of AI-assisted coding. Even though Gaysinskiy considers himself a strong coder, he had a begrudging realization in the last few weeks that \"AI is starting to get better at this than me,\" he said, laughing.The realization has got him excited to harness the power, he said, and make some big decisions on where to concentrate the firepower and what workflows should be transformed.His advice to engineers working in or planning to work in Wall Street's tech ranks is to embrace the fact that the environment is constantly changing. This is especially true because, he said, the industry is ripe for AI disruption.So much of the business is digitized, but the complexities of the business (from developing software for different financial instruments to the regulatory nuances of emerging markets) has largely held the industry back.For engineers interested in applying technology to solve interesting problems, and particularly \"where the AI disruption will occur, I think this actually would be an industry to watch,\" Gaysinskiy said.Read the original article on Business Insider Ilya Gaysinskiy, CTO of Point72Point72Ilya Gaysinskiy, chief technology officer at Point72, joined from Goldman Sachs in September 2024.His first priority is to hire more talent by building out its Poland hub and a new India office.In his first interview since joining Steve Cohen's fund, Gaysinskiy shares plans for talent and AI.It's not surprising that billionaire and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen likes to win.

        "description": "Goldman Sachs expects gold to hit $3,300 an ounce by year-end as tariff uncertainty bolsters ETF inflows. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIGold reached a fresh high over over $3,100 an ounce on Monday. The safe haven is gaining on tariff fears, falling yields, and a declining dollar.Goldman expects the gold prices to reach $3,300 an ounce by year-end.Tariff anxiety is crushing risk appetite and sending gold to fresh highs amid the flight to safety.The yellow metal surged to $3,127 per ounce Monday morning, up $100 in less than a week. Tariff-driven economic fears have made it one of this year's hottest commodities, having gained 18.3% so far in 2025.The metal gained momentum amid heavy losses in US stocks on Monday as traders brace for the April 2 tariff date set by Trump. Investors worry that the sweeping duties could escalate a global trade war, battering US markets and the economy. The tariffs have been the chief culprit behind the stock market's correction this year, and explain why Treasury yields have dropped to the 4% range.But the stock market's pain is gold's gain this year. \"While stocks falter, gold continues to shine. The metal's status as a safe haven has been reinforced by tightening financial conditions, falling bond yields, and a weaker US dollar,\" wrote Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com. \"As foreign demand for US assets drops due to lower yields, the environment becomes increasingly supportive for non-yielding assets like gold.\"At $3,100 an ounce, the metal trades above the year-end forecasts made at the end of 2024.But since President Donald Trump took office, banks such as Goldman Sachs have reassessed expectations. As of last week, the bank now sees $3,300 as the likely outcome, as tariff fears have reshaped gold flows and a pick up in central bank demand.\"While ETF flows generally track Fed policy rates, history shows they can overshoot during extended periods of macro uncertainty -- such as during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" the bank wrote Wednesday.Goldman Sachs ResearchWhile technical indicators suggest gold is currently overbought, broader bullish momentum should overcome any short-term consolidation, Hathorn said. The next level of resistance for the metal will be at $3,200. But some are not so sure the metal can keep outperforming. Morningstar analyst Jon Mills told Business Insider that a number of headwinds will drag gold to $1,820 in the coming years.For now, tariff jitters are also moving other metals. Copper, which reached a nine-month high recently, is in retreat ahead of the April levies. According to ING, industrial metals suffer if tariffs slow global growth.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Hedge funds have shed technology stocks at the fastest pace in six months, according to data from Goldman Sachs. A trader works during the Fed rate announcement on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 20, 2019.Reuters/Brendan McDermidInvestors are selling tech stocks ahead of Trump's Wednesday tariff deadlineThe Nasdaq 100 fell 7% in four days, with mega-cap tech stocks down 10%.Hedge funds are driving the tech sell-off, with concerns over valuations and earnings.Investors are fleeing technology stocks ahead of President Trump's tariff deadline on Wednesday.The Nasdaq 100 is down 7% in just four trading days, and the damage has been even worse for the mega-cap tech giants, with an equally weighted basket of the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks declining about 10% since last Tuesday.Hedge funds derisk in momentum unwindThe swift price decline speaks to a broader unwind in Wall Street's momentum trade as investors shed risk amid increasing economic uncertainty, which is set to crescendo on April 2 when Trump is expected to unveil a long list of new tariffs.The easiest way for investors to shed risk is to sell some of their largest positions, which mega-cap tech stocks have dominated in recent years.That's evidenced by the fact that even though tech is seen as having limited exposure to tariffs, it's underperforming sectors that are more at risk of pain from the trade war. In the past week, consumer discretionary stocks have dropped 5%, industrial stocks declined 3%, and consumer staples stocks jumped 3%.According to data from Goldman Sachs' trading desk, a lot of the selling in the tech sector has been driven by hedge funds, with the group selling down their tech exposure at the fastest pace in six months.The notional value of tech's decline is the second largest over the past five years, according to the bank, and some of the selling volume is related to fresh short positions being taken.Risks include high valuations, earnings dropWhile the tech sector may have limited exposure to Trump's tariffs, the tariffs themselves could be waking investors up to other risks in the sector.Those include elevated valuations, the potential for interest rate hikes if inflation accelerates, and concerns about declining earnings if the economy slows.The tech sector trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25x, well above the S&P 500's 20.5x multiple, according to data from Factset.According to Brent Thill, an equity analyst at Jefferies, the DOGE government cuts also serve as an overhang for the sector, with Accenture being the latest company to highlight the cuts as a headwind. Thill cut his price targets for five software stocks on Monday. Microsoft went to $500 from $550, Amazon to $250 from $275, Meta Platforms to $$725 from $810, Alphabet to $200 from $235, and Snowflake to $190 from $220.According to Thill, macroeconomic uncertainty is pausing deal flow in the tech sector and could also lead to a slowdown in advertising spending.\"You've obviously had a tremendous amount of concern over DOGE, you had many companies talk that they're seeing an uncertain environment including Accenture, Lulu and Fedex, so we think that it would make sense that these deals could be delayed into the back half of the year,\" Thill told CNBC on Monday.AI still needs to deliver revenues and profitsThill said most of his clients are in \"wait and see mode\" when it comes to buying software stocks because the AI profits have yet to deliver.\"We've got to see the ROI on some of these initial investments,\" Thill said, adding that until profits are realized, future spending on AI could come to a standstill.\"We have to see AI revenue come in, and we're at 1% to 3% of the software industry of total revenue is AI today, it's tiny,\" Thill said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs cut its S&P 500 target and raised its recession forecast. The bank now sees a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs raised its probability of a US recession happening in the next 12 months to 35% this week, up from a prior 20% probability.Adobe Firefly, Tyler Le/BIGoldman Sachs cut its price target for the S&P 500 for the second time this year.The bank sees the stock market losing 5% over the next three months.The bank is eyeing risks stemming from tariffs and a higher probability of a recession in the US.The outlook for the stock market is becoming increasingly uncertain, thanks largely to the potential impact of an escalating global trade war. Strategists at Goldman Sachs on Sunday night slashed their forecast for the S&P 500 for the second time this year, lowering targets for the benchmark index's return to -5% in the coming three months and 6% over 12 months, down from 0% and 16% respectively.That implies the S&P 500 trading between 5,300 to 5,900 over the next year, the bank said in a note to clients, meaning they don't expect the index to return to previous all-time highs are 6,100 anytime soon. Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 to trade within a range of 5,300-5,900 for the next year.Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe downgrade is largely driven by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policy, which is shaping up to be more severe than the bank was expecting, according to a team led by Goldman's chief US equity strategist, David Kostin.The bank now expects the average US tariff rate to hover around 18%, up 15 basis points from last year. It also expects average annual GDP growth to slow to 1.5% from last year's 2%, while core PCE inflation, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, will accelerate to 3.5%, up from last year's 3%.\"Higher tariffs, weaker economic growth, and greater inflation than we previously assumed lead us to cut our S&P 500 EPS growth forecasts to +3 in 2025 (from +7%) and +% in 2026 (from +7%),\" strategists said. \"We expect a further valuation decline in the near term,\" they added.The bank also sees the US facing a higher risk of recession in the next year. Goldman economists now estimate that the US has a 35% chance of tipping into a recession in the next 12 months, up from the prior estimate of 20%.If stocks follow the historical playbook for a recession, the S&P 500 could see a 25% drawdown from its peak, strategists said. That implies the index will drop as low as 4,600 in the event of a downturn, the bank estimated, or a 21% drop from the index's current levels.\"We continue to recommend investors watch for an improvement in the growth outlook, more asymmetry in market pricing, or depressed positioning before trying to trade a bottom,\" strategists wrote.Stocks have been mired in a correction after falling more than 10% from mid-February highs, and the S&P 500 is now down 5% since the start of the year.Markets have been dealing with greater uncertainty stemming from Trump's trade policy and retaliatory tariffs slapped, as well as the growing risk of a recession in the US.Economic growth has already shown signs of slowing. GDP is expected to contract 2.8% for the first quarter, according to the latest projection from the Atlanta Fed.Inflation was also hotter than expected last month, with PCE prices accelerating 2.8% year over year.Wall Street forecasters, including Stifel, UBS, and Bank of America, have been warning of the rising risk of stagflation, a scenario that involves sluggish growth and high inflation and which could be more difficult for the Fed to deal with than a recession.

The posting comes as the Wall Street bank moves up its annual headcount-cutting ritual and contemplates potential reductions to its vice president population, among other cost-saving measures codenamed Project Voyage.According to the listing, the new hire would be based in New York City and receive a base salary of between $100,000 and $160,000. Previously, the post called for a vice president whose salary would have been between $125,000 and $250,000. After BI contacted Goldman about the post, the bank modified the role to the lower-paid associate rank.\"We thank the team at Business Insider for using your 20th article on Goldman Sachs' corporate aircraft to help us track top talent for this role,\" a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said in a statement to BI.In 2019, the year after Solomon took over as the bank's CEO, Goldman purchased two private aircraft: a Gulfstream G280 and a G650ER. At the time, the bank determined that owning its jets outright would be more cost-effective than booking private flights through NetJets, a fractional ownership service, as BI has previously reported.In 2023, the firm scrapped plans to purchase a third plane amid a cost-cutting push and scrutiny over Solomon's use of the jets. Solomon had used the planes for some personal flights, including visiting his home in the Bahamas, BI's Dakin Campbell reported at the time.Earlier this month, Goldman's board said in a proxy filing that it expects its CEO — and its President and COO John Waldron — to use its jets for personal travel and business.\"The primary use of our corporate aircraft is to facilitate business,\" the firm said, adding: \"Our CEO and COO are expected to use our corporate aircraft, including for personal travel, for security reasons, as well as to maximize the efficiency of their travel time and their availability for firm business.\"The new associate will be part of the corporate aviation integrated services team within the executive office, a division that encompasses units like marketing, corporate communications, and some philanthropic and public-facing programs. It's helmed by Russell Horwitz, the bank's chief of staff.So… does the gig sound like one for you? Before you buckle up your seatbelt and tap the intercom for a glass of Champagne, it's important to know that this role appears to be based on the ground — not in a plush leather recliner in the air, enjoying a view over the wings.According to the job post, this associate will be focused on tasks such as assuming \"operations & financial oversight of the firm's executive aviation program, including business owned aircraft & fractional aircraft interest.\" The person will assemble reports, perform some bookkeeping activities, and develop policies and procedures relating to the aviation program. They'll also \"assist with all aviation operational matters,\" like ensuring planes are available when execs need to hop a ride.The ideal candidate should have at least five years of experience working in a \"business aviation team environment,\" the post added.Here are a few other attributes the bank is looking for:Be an \"enthusiastic, hardworking\" member of the team who is \"able to work well under pressure\"Top-tier communications skillsKnow how to work your magic in Microsoft Excel and creating original presentationsSo if you don't mind the logistical work and have a sense for what it takes to keep the trains (or planes) running on time — then, who knows?

        "description": "IPO will mean more revenue pressure and possibly more ads. As previously rumored, Discord, a popular communications platform, is working with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to plan an IPO as soon as this year, according to a recent report by Bloomberg. The report cites people familiar with the matter and notes that more advisors may come on board as the talks progress. This isn't the first we've heard about plans for an IPO; an article in The New York Times claimed that Discord had begun exploratory meetings with bankers earlier this month. Even way back in 2022, Discord was exploring the option of a direct listing, but it now seems the company plans to go with a traditional IPO. Launched in 2015, Discord was initially conceived as an improved way to facilitate communication while playing video games—and gaming-related uses still account for more than 90 percent of its activity. While some previous tools focused mainly on in-game voice chat, Discord supports text, voice, and video, as well as game streaming. It also has robust features for managing communities outside the game and has developer APIs for developing bots, tools, and games that can be used within its channels.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The hugely anticipated next-gen version of Nintendo's handheld console is expected to be released ahead of this year's holiday shopping season. The Nintendo Switch.Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Nintendo of AmericaNintendo stock is a buy as the Switch 2 launch nears, says Goldman Sachs.Goldman sees the Switch 2 boosting Nintendo's profits and sales to record levels.Nintendo's movie ventures and strong balance sheet add to its growth potential.The Switch 2 is around the corner and investors are going to want to pay attention to the release of Nintendo's next-generation handheld console. Goldman Sachs resumed its coverage of Nintendo stock this week with a \"Buy\" rating and a price target of ¥13,600 for the Japanese-listed shares, representing possible upside of 20% from current levels.ADR-listed shares of Nintendo, which trade under the ticker symbol \"NTDOY,\" surged 4% in Wednesday's trading session to $18.78.Goldman is encouraged that the Switch 2, which is expected to be released before the holiday shopping season later this year, could drive the company's profits to record levels.Goldman Sachs\"We look for a further re-rating of Nintendo shares on expectations that the launch of the Switch 2 will drive growth in hardware and software sales, and that user engagement on the Nintendo Switch platform (including the legacy Switch) will remain strong,\" Goldman Sachs said.The company is rumored to announce details of the Switch 2 console, including features, launch date, sales price, and launch titles during the Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2.Goldman is also encouraged by Nintendo's foray into movies, capitalizing on its deep bench of intellectual property. In 2023, the Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, generating $1.3 billion in worldwide box office revenue.In a bid to replicate that success, Nintendo has confirmed that a movie based on the Legend of Zelda videogame is in development.Finally, Goldman highlighted that Nintendo has a clean balance sheet with no debt and an attractive equity ratio of 83%.The ADR-listed shares of Nintendo are up 28% year-to-date, and up 37% over the past year. The stock is trading near record highs.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "American companies are investing more in their future and getting a better return on their investments than overseas peers, Goldman Sachs said. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesUS exceptionalism will persist despite international stocks outperforming the S&P 500 this year, Goldman Sachs said.Goldman Sachs notes US firms' higher research and development investment boosts growth in the long term.US companies lead in return on investment, which helps drive long-term innovation.The US exceptionalism trade looks likely to persist, despite fears that America's stock market dominance is waning as international stocks outperform the S&P 500 this year.That's according to Goldman Sachs, which highlighted ae key advantage American companies have over their international peers: returns on investment in research and development and other areas aimed at growing their business. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, highlighted that firms within the S&P 500 have a growth investment ratio nearly double that of other global equity markets.Those staggering research and development costs can unlock significant growth down the road.\"The Growth Investment Ratio is treated in the US (42%) than Rest of World (26%) and the gap has been steadily widening in recent years,\" Kostin said.Goldman SachsKostin calculates the growth investment ratio by adding growth capex, which is capex less depreciation, to research and development costs as a share of cash flow from operations.In addition, the return on investment for US-based companies is higher than that of their international peers, at 80% compared to 73%.In other words, American companies are investing more in their future and getting a better return on their investments than their overseas peers.That's key to continuing the US exceptionalism trade, as America continues to lead in the biggest industries and in cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotech research.\"Maintaining US equity market exceptionalism will require both the magnitude of growth investment and the returns on those investments to remain elevated during the next several years,\" Kostin said.The call from Goldman Sachs contrasts with other Wall Street firms that are worried about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's uncertain trade policies.Earlier this month, Citi strategists recommended that investors take profits in US stocks and load up on Chinese stocks due to the expected unraveling of the US exceptionalism trade.However, Morgan Stanley also noted this week that a resurgence of US tech stocks could ultimately pave the way for a refresh of US stock market dominance.

Healthcare startup Navina says its AI can help.Navina works with 1,300 clinics to sift through medical data from a wide range of sources, from electronic health records to insurance claims, to surface clinical insights to physicians — right in their existing workflows.Now, Navina has raised $55 million in Series C funding to keep growing, Business Insider has learned exclusively.Goldman Sachs' growth equity division led the Series C raise, with participation from all existing investors, including ALIVE, Grove Ventures, and Vertex Ventures Israel. The fundraise brings Navina's total funding to $100 million since its 2018 founding.Navina's solution integrates with EHR systems like Athenahealth, Epic, and Cerner to flag potential diagnoses, identify risk factors and spot medication conflicts. The startup houses its research and development team in Tel Aviv, Israel, and its commercial team in New York City.

Healthcare startup Navina says its AI can help.Navina works with 1,300 clinics to sift through medical data from a wide range of sources, from electronic health records to insurance claims, to surface clinical insights to physicians — right in their existing workflows.Now, Navina has raised $55 million in Series C funding to keep growing, Business Insider has learned exclusively.Goldman Sachs' growth equity division led the Series C raise, with participation from all existing investors, including ALIVE, Grove Ventures, and Vertex Ventures Israel. The fundraise brings Navina's total funding to $100 million since its 2018 founding.Navina's solution integrates with EHR systems like Athenahealth, Epic, and Cerner to flag potential diagnoses, identify risk factors and spot medication conflicts. The startup houses its research and development team in Tel Aviv, Israel, and its commercial team in New York City.

        "description": "January and February data out of China hae beat expectations and real GDP growth is tracking slightly over 5%, according to Goldman Sachs. China's government is encouraging consumer spending through measures such as trade-in program for household goods.CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesChina's economy is showing signs of recovery, with better-than-expected data in January and February.Although economic activity remained soft, many indicators appear to have stopped deteriorating, per Goldman Sachs.China's economy is dogged by a property crisis, deflation, and challenges in the employment landscape.China's economy and markets have been battered over the last few years due to an epic property crisis and post-pandemic scarring — but it may now be turning the corner.Data from the world's second-largest economy for the first two months of the year beat expectations and real GDP growth is tracking slightly over 5%, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Friday note. This is higher than the firm's 4.9% forecast.\"The narrative shifted notably in early 2025. Although economic activity remained soft, many indicators appear to have stopped deteriorating,\" wrote the analysts at Goldman Sachs.The analysts' assessment of China's economy came just days before April 2, when US President Donald Trump's administration is planning to impose new reciprocal tariffs.Goldman Sachs' analysis showed that despite a 20 percentage-point increase in US tariffs in the past two months, an index for Chinese trader uncertainty hasn't risen much, \"implying that the tariff drag to domestic investment might be smaller than we currently expect.\"Credit growth is also accelerating — a sign of potential growth as businesses and people borrow — and on-the-ground signs from Goldman Sachs' research teams indicate stability or marginal improvements in several key sectors, including property.Meanwhile, stock markets have been buoyed by a tech-led rally prompted by the rise of the cost-efficient AI model DeepSeek and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's meeting with private sector entrepreneurs last month as a sign of endorsement.To be sure, much of China's current economic fundamentals have not changed. Industrial activity and investment in manufacturing are still outperforming, while property activity remains depressed. Inflation also remains \"too low\" and employment remains challenging, wrote the Goldman Sachs analysts.Despite government initiatives, including a trade-in program to incentivize new purchases, consumption is still slow — although there are bright spots.\"While there has been no meaningful rebound in overall consumption, our consumer analysts note signs of bottoming out: the seasonal consumption pull-back after the Lunar New Year holiday was better than feared; pricing and promotion trends appeared to be more stable and less aggressive than before,\" wrote Goldman Sachs's analysts.Lynn Song, the chief economist of Greater China at ING, wrote in a note last week that China's consumption is on a \"gradual recovery momentum\" as retail sales in the first two months of the year beat expectations. The growth was boosted by items under the trade-in program, including automobiles, home appliances, and mobile phones.Even spending on discretionary items that did not benefit from government trade-in programs got off to a \"decent start\" this year, said Song, citing growth rates of 5.4%, 4.4%, and 3.3% in retail spending for gold and jewelry, cosmetics, and apparel, respectively.Such budding positive signs could help drive even more positivity.\"Just like in 2023 and 2024 when various negative forces amplified one another and yielded outsized headwinds to growth, positive catalysts in early 2025 have the potential to reinforce each other and generate a more virtuous cycle,\" wrote analysts at Goldman Sachs.Still, nearly all economists and analysts are cautious about calling for a full-on recovery for China's economy. It could be weighed down by issues such as Trump's trade war and the prolonged property downturn.As Nomura economists wrote in a note last week, better-than-expected Chinese economic data \"mask serious underlying challenges.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

This week in artificial intelligence (AI) news saw Apple facing an AI reckoning, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said computing demand is set to jump 100-fold. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs looks ahead to a year of scaling AI; Hollywood’s upset at AI and IP issues; and Citi sees AI agent-to-agent payment systems coming. Apple Demotes Executive as Siri Lags in AI Upgrades Apple took the rare move of removing its top executive in charge of Siri upgrades as the AI assistant struggled to keep up with rivals like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android and Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Apple’s obsession with perfection, a top management that lacked vision and the missing brilliance of Steve Jobs have now come home to roost.

At its GTC developer conference, Huang said the shift to AI agents and reasoning models means the amount of computation necessary to train and do inference on those models “has grown tremendously.” He also predicted that in the future, working alongside the world’s one billion knowledge workers will be 10 billion AI agents.

        "description": "Recession talk is growing, with Goldman Sachs raising its recession probability to 20% recently. Pain is also being felt in households and the stock market. Bet_Noire/Getty, Jim Lin/Getty, SusanWoodImages/Getty, Tyler Le/BIInvestors and economists have grown concerned about a potential recession this year.Prominent bears say a downturn could emerge as early as July.Here are four warning signs economic forecasters have flagged recently.Recession talk is growing louder on Wall Street, and forecasters are pointing to a handful of warning signs that suggest am economic downturn may be on the horizon.Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs raised its probability of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%.According to a March survey conducted by Bank of America, 55% of fund managers said they saw a global recession triggered by a trade war as the top tail risk for the market.Meanwhile, the number of consumers who said they expected a recession in the next 12 months spiked to a nine-month high, according to the Conference Board's latest Consumer Confidence Survey.The Conference Board Consumer Confidence SurveyDavid Rosenberg, an economist and a vocal market bear, said he believes a downturn could strike in the next few months. In a recent note to clients, he pointed to a handful of warnings that suggested the economy was weakening.\"We keep hearing that there is no recession and that the economy is in solid shape because of the low unemployment rate. But it is change and not the level that matters for the economic cycle,\" Rosenberg said. \"If the past is prescient, the recession which nobody believes will rear its ugly head will materialize as early as July.\"Here are four warning signs he and other economic forecasters have flagged recently. 1. Household finances are deterioratingUS households are showing signs they're struggling to keep up with the pace of inflation, something that could pose a major headwind to the US economy given that consumer spending makes up around two-thirds of GDP.Notably, Americans are less likely to be able to cover an emergency expense. According to the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed, 63% of US households said they had enough cash on hand to cover a surprise $2,000 bill.New York Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer ExpectationsAccording to an analysis from Apollo Global Management, that's the lowest percentage of Americans who said they had emergency cash on had since the fourth quarter of 2015.\"Taking into account that the CPI level today is 35% higher than in 2015, the situation is even worse,\" Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, wrote.The survey also found that 34% of Americans said they expected to have to come up with $,2000 over the next month.At the same time, households also have higher debt burdens. Total household debt rose $93 billion over the fourth quarter, hitting a record $18 trillion, New York Fed data shows.2. Small and mid-cap stocks are doing poorlySmall- and mid-cap stocks have been struggling. The corner of the market looks to be \"deep in correction terrain,\" Rosenberg wrote. That could be a bad indicator for the US, given that small- to mid-cap stocks are highly sensitive to economic changes. The iShares S&P Small-cap 600 Value ETF is down 16% from its peak in November.The S&P MidCap 400 is down a similar 13% from its high in November.\"Both peaked within three weeks after the election … honeymoon ended very quickly,\" Rosenberg added.3. More companies are warning of weaker earningsMore US companies have been warning investors that guidance for earnings this year is looking slightly weaker than anticipated. Companies viewed as key economic bellwethers, like Walmart, Target, and FedEx have slashed guidance for the year.According to Rosenberg's analysis, around 70% of companies that have reported earnings this season have cited uncertainty around new policies and the president's tariffs as one reason the outlook could be negative this year.\"US equity futures are flashing red as corporate guidance continues to deteriorate,\" he said.4. The bond market is pricing in more risksBond investors are pricing in a greater risk that more companies could buckle in the coming years.Credit spreads, which measure the difference between the yield on corporate bonds over a benchmark like US Treasurys, have risen \"substantially\" in the last month, according to a note Goldman Sachs released on Friday. That reflects investors pricing in higher risk that a corporate borrower could struggle to pay back debt. \"We've had a couple of quarters now where spreads were stuck at the very low end of the historical range,\" Lotfi Karoui, a chief credit strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, said in a podcast last week. \"They should gradually go back to levels that are closer to historical medians, to reflect the new reality of elevated macro volatility and incrementally higher recession risk,\" he added, though he noted that spreads were still far from recessionary levels.US firms had a 9.2% chance of defaulting at the end of 2024, the highest risk of default since the Great Financial Crisis, according to a Moody's analysis.The average 1-year expected probability of default for all US public companies hovered around 9% at the end of 2024Moody's RatingsRead the original article on Business Insider",

Goldman Sachs is rolling out and scaling artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities across its business, as the investment bank harnesses the benefits of productivity and efficiency from this fast-moving technology. “For us, this year is a story of scale — scale of adoption, scale of use cases,” said Belinda Neal, Goldmans’ chief operating officer of core engineering, head of product management and head of engineering partnerships. “With generative AI, we’ve been really excited about some of the new potential of the technology to deliver efficiency and productivity benefits across the firm,” Neal said in an exclusive interview with PYMNTS. PYMNTS data is showing a growing return on investment (ROI) as businesses are starting to reap the benefits of AI capital investments. Based on a survey of 540 C-suite executives, 57% of information firms report very positive ROI from their GenAI deployments. Other sectors are seeing varying returns. Goldman’s Playbook Neal said the investment bank is taking a multi-pronged approach to AI: It built Goldman’s in-house GS AI Platform to be the foundation for AI applications for different business use cases. The platform offers multiple state-of-the-art AI models but with Goldman’s guardrails. It is working with major technology companies to help it deploy AI capabilities at scale. It is focused on security and governance as a foundational guardrail. Neal said a key enabler of AI throughout the company is the creation of “AI champions,” a team of employees within each business group tasked with finding the most effective use cases for AI in their line of business. These AI champions form the “connective tissue” across the firm, she added. “That is an absolutely critical part of how adoption is going to be driven and where we’re going to see the highest value from” in its AI efforts. One of Goldman’s internal AI applications is the GS AI Assistant, a generative AI chatbot rolling out to its bankers, traders and other workers. It can do things such as summarize documents, draft emails, create bullet points for a speech and more. The assistant will eventually transform into a smarter sidekick with the traits of a seasoned Goldman executive. Neal said about 10,000 employees currently have access, which will be rolled out across the company this year “subject to governance.” GenAI chatbots have a tendency to hallucinate, or make things up in a convincing way, which is a security risk for any company, but especially the highly regulated financial services industry. Neal said there’s still a human reviewer of the chatbot’s responses, and employees are trained to be mindful of these hallucination risks. It is “absolutely something that we’re looking to continue to improve over time, through the use of new models (and) new practices,” she said. Goldman joins other Wall Street banking titans JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in aggressively developing AI capabilities.

Neal said the firm has more than 12,000 developers, which constitute a quarter of its total workforce. That means productivity and efficiency gains achieved in this group would have a large impact on the company. “The developer use case is one of the early use cases where we’ve really seen large-scale adoption and large-scale benefit,” Neal said. “What we’re going to start to see over time, especially over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, is more scale and adoption of those capabilities.” But more than equipping its developers, Goldman wants them to stay on top of AI’s advances. “We really want to be able to … employ that best-in-class technology as quickly as possible into some of these platforms so that we can enable our developers and our individuals across the businesses to use the best technology,” Neal said. A third priority use case revolves around governance and how the firm thinks about risk and control, Neal said. “We’ve doubled down on our focus around ensuring safe and secure AI deployment.” Tapping Into Tech Goldman’s Chairman and CEO David Solomon has said that CEOs see the benefits of AI. “The more complicated thing that CEOs are wrestling with is how the technology can be deployed to significantly change operational processes,” Solomon said at the Cisco AI Summit in Palo Alto, California, in January. “But to do that, you have to fundamentally change your processes, and that’s a very hard thing for organizations to do.” As Goldman rolls out its large language models, it is already preparing for the advent of AI agents. Neal said Goldman is taking a holistic approach by thinking of agentic AI as reinventing entire workflows, not just single tasks. These agents will also become reasoning models over time, she said. Looking ahead, Neal said there’s a lot of interest in the firm around AI use cases for document or life cycle management. “I’d say this is just the next generation of us being able to use technology to drive value to the business in terms of how we’re operating efficiently, but also how we’re delivering best-in-class service for our clients,” Neal said.

        "description": "Leaders “transition” for a number of reasons—from promotions, layoffs, and changes in ownership. Whether it’s Goldman Sachs eyeing job cuts or the federal government downsizing senior-level government workers in the Trump era, transitions take an emotional toll. The recent turmoil at multiple government departments that impacts tens of thousands of experienced federal employees is another reminder that leadership transitions are messy. There’s more to change than an unemotional cost-benefit analysis, and that’s the emotional toll. Transitions are major life stressors. But we don’t see organizations giving leaders—nor do we see leaders give themselves—the time and resources to work through the emotional side of change. Suppressed or unprocessed emotions—like anxiety or grieving what used to be—don’t just disappear. Instead, they accumulate and surface as procrastination, cynicism, internalized self-doubt, exhaustion, blame, and avoidance. If we don’t quickly correct it, these self-defeating coping mechanisms will undermine the psychological safety of an entire team. It can also break trust, which leads to half-hearted execution. In this scenario, even the most vibrant workplace cultures can turn transactional, which undermines results. The best approach is to prepare for your emotions, embrace them, and design them. Here are some steps to follow. Step 1: prepare Most of the time, you can see a transition coming, or at least the potential for it in your future. If possible, you should engage in a few key activities while they have a clear and focused mind. Create a personal coping plan by identifying the healthiest ways that people generally cope with the ups and downs of everyday life. Does music lift your spirits? Does going for a run give you energy? For example, when I left the stability of full-time work to start executive coaching, I committed to making breakfast for the family. This was something I couldn’t do when working a 9 to 5. It’s also crucial to diversify your support system. Find people who will support your efforts to process and move through emotions, including friends, family, a coach, or even a therapist. Leaning into a special support system supports resilience. It also protects you from those who would rather rile you up or commiserate with you. Step 2: Embrace Embracing the emotional rollercoaster of change starts with recognizing that ups and downs are natural and not signs of failure. The emotional stages—ranging from excitement and optimism to fear, resistance, and eventually acceptance—are all part of the journey. Feel the feelings by labeling emotions, instead of letting them exist anonymously. If needed, refer to a feelings chart, like this one from The Work of Byron Katie. Once you have the words for your feelings, it’s best to get them out. If you tend to bottle things up, try doing something like going to a boxing class to express anger or watching a sad movie to cry. Once you have control of emotional expression, it is time to design the future. Whether it’s a new job or a new industry altogether, ask those around you, “What does success look like?” Step 3: Design Once you’ve embraced your natural emotional reactions and you’re no longer running the show on autodrive, it’s timeto design the emotions. You can do this for yourself and others to support everyone’s success. Start by defining “positive.” We all want the workplace to be a positive experience, but put it into action. You can do this by choosing three to five key emotions that you can bake into your workplace on a daily basis. For example, the leader of a new start-up might choose “excited, energized, and eager.” The leader of a compliance unit might choose “confident, respected, and engaged.” Don’t just wait for the positive emotions you’ve identified to materialize naturally; create experiences that bring them out to play. For instance, to prompt excitement, you could build time into team meetings for team members to share something that excites them, and how they plan to celebrate. To prompt respect, you may have a senior leader express their appreciation for the team’s work. By preparing for transitions, embracing the emotions they stir, and intentionally designing experiences that foster resilience, we create environments where teams can thrive. Despite the challenges, leadership transitions can be a very positive outcome. Public- and private-sector executives and human resources teams need to implement leadership transition plans, harnessing executive coaches to support leaders for transition success. For example, when a senior director transitions to an expanded vice president role, executive coaches who specialize in leadership transitions can help that leader prevent failure while also building executive presence and business acumen. Similarly, if a successful leader experienced a lay-off and less experienced one steps in, transition coaching can bridge the gap so that the best practices endure. These are difficult times for many, but true leaders will overcome today’s adversity with proper support. For those with seniority, the end of the road at a specific organization doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the road for your career or your former team. Will you let change dictate the experience, or will you take an active role in shaping it?",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs finds that people are willing to prioritize going to concerts, even when pinching pennies elsewhere. BSR Agency/Getty ImagesThe live music industry is particularly well-positioned to hold up during a recession.Goldman Sachs laid out five reasons why the industry has historically been resilient during downturns.The firm finds that people prioritize live music, even when spending is tight.Recession talk is getting louder across Wall Street. But even if the US slips into full-fledged economic downturn, one industry is well-positioned to weather the storm: live music.That's according to Goldman Sachs, who labeled live music more \"recession resilient\" than other forms of entertainment.The firm found that over a 30-year period starting in 1990, the live-music industry saw average growth of 7.3% during recession years, far outpacing other areas of entertainment.US Bureau of Economic Analysis/Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchFurther, since 1990, spending growth for live entertainment has soared 735%. That outpaces any other form of entertainment, including gambling, sports, and theaters, according to Goldman's analysis of government spending data.\"Historically, the Live Music industry has shown a relatively strong degree of resilience in times of economic volatility,\" strategists led by Stephen Laszczyk wrote in a Monday note to clients. The firm went on to detail five reasons why live music is especially resilient.1. It's a well-established industryOver the last 30 years, the market for live music has grown less niche and more mainstream, which has helped prop up the industry through economic downturns.The global live music market was worth around $34.8 billion in 2024, and is expected to swell to $62.5 billion over the next decade, according to an estimate from Custom Market Insights.\"The relatively small base that the industry grew off of combined with the strong secular tailwinds that developed over the years helped drive compounding revenue growth in a way that appeared unaffected by periods of consumer spending weakness,\" Goldman said.2. There's a large secondary market that will insulate direct ticket-sellersThere's a big market for people reselling their concert tickets, which has helped insulate the market from weaker consumer spending.In 2019, secondary ticket brokers took in around $1.3 billion in profits on Live Nation shows, the music events giant estimated.\"We view this profit pool as a cushion that helps absorb declines in consumer spending. For example, in the event of a recession, we would expect that the secondary market would absorb most of the pressure on marginal demand, insulating the underlying profitability of the live music industry,\" analysts said.3. Live music has gone globalLive music has spread well beyond Europe and North America, with Latin America and Asia now making up a significant portion of the global demand for concerts. That sprawl has helped insulate the industry when the US economy isn't doing so hot.4. The industry offers still good value, relatively speakingWhile ticket prices have increased faster than the pace of inflation over the last several decades, concerts are still relatively cheap compared to other forms of live entertainment.The average price to a Top 100 Live Nation concert hovered around $106 in 2022. That was still cheaper than the average ticket to an NFL game, which cost around $258 that year, or the average Broadway show, which cost around $133, according to Goldman's analysis.Live Nation/ESPN/Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\"We believe that the relative affordability (and value) of concerts makes live music more recession resistant compared to other higher priced forms of entertainment,\" the bank wrote.5. Consumers prioritize live music when spending gets tightFinally, consumers just can't seem to give up concert experiences, even when there's pressure to tighten their wallets.Only 6% of people said they would first cut back on live music events if they had to reduce their spending, though 67% would cut back on gambling, while 28% would cut back on sporting events, a 2019 Live Nation survey found.Live Nation/Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchLive music has also shown no signs of slowing so far this year.\"Indeed, we have yet to see a meaningful slowdown in the high frequency indicators that we follow, including Placer geo-location attendance data at arenas (through the end of February) and Sensor Tower app engagement data for Ticketmaster (through mid-March),\" the bank added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The macroeconomic outlook for the US remains uncertain as the second Trump administration appears to have a higher tolerance for market turbulence. The US stock markets have been volatile recently.Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty ImagesThe US stock market selloff is prompting investors to seek opportunities in global equities.Emerging markets are outperforming as US recession fears drive investors to diversify their portfolios.However, a US economic slowdown would still pose risks to global markets.The recent stock market rout in the US has benefited equities elsewhere as investors rotate investments — but their long-term gains could still hinge on the American economy.Last week, the US stock markets saw a brutal selloff over fears of a recession. The S&P 500 is down 4% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 8% so far this year.In contrast, the Euro Stoxx 50 index is 10.4% higher year to date, especially after Germany and Europe announced defense and government spending plans. Meanwhile, a China tech rally sent Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 20% while the mainland's CSI 300 index has risen about 2%.Such recent market moves mark an \"unusual outperformance\" for European and emerging markets stocks relative to the US, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Sunday note. But they said there are limits to the decoupling — especially if US economic activity and growth continue to decelerate and an American recession becomes a \"real risk.\"\"In those scenarios — where the US catches a bad cold — tighter financial conditions and higher risk aversion tend to spill over into global markets as well,\" they wrote.The analysts wrote that markets in Europe and China have been swiftly boosted by the EU and Germany's huge fiscal packages and AI developments, respectively. But if the US economy and markets weaken further, these other markets may need more supportive factors to continue their positive performance.Goldman Sachs' report comes after the recent cratering in US stocks sent investors looking for market winners elsewhere.Meanwhile, the macroeconomic and market outlook for the US — the world's largest economy, which accounts for about one-quarter of global GDP — remains uncertain as the second Trump administration appears to have a higher tolerance for market turbulence.On Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News that there are \"no guarantees\" there won't be a recession. He also said he was \"not at all\" worried about the volatile stock markets.US President Donald Trump has also recently declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.\"The challenge is that because new policy announcements are still coming and because the timing of the impact of uncertainty is not clear, it may take time before the market can gain confidence that the economy is avoiding more lasting damage even if the data holds up,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman's chief US equity strategist lowered his year-end price target for the S&P 500, but said there's a path to recovery for stocks. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIGoldman Sachs cut its S&P 500 target due to tariff-related economic uncertainties.The bank said every five percentage point increase in tariffs decreases S&P 500 earnings by 1%-2%.But the bank sees three ways the stock market could signal it has bottomed.The near 10% correction in the S&P 500 over the past month is rattling investors, but Goldman Sachs says there's a pathway for a recovery.David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at the bank, issued a note on Tuesday that included a reduction in the bank's year-end price target for the S&P 500 from 6,500 to 6,200. Kostin blamed economic uncertainties related to the Trump administration's trade policy as the main reason for the decrease, arguing that earnings and valuation multiples will be pressured as long as the US continues down the tariff path.\"Our rule of thumb is that every 5 pp increase in the US tariff rate reduces S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1-2%, assuming companies are able to pass through most of the tariffs to consumers,\" Kostin said.However, Kostin said three factors could drive a swift recovery in the stock market — and he added that only one of these things needs to be triggered for the rally to restart. Change in the economic growth outlookA growth scare has gripped Wall Street in recent weeks, with the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow growth forecast for first-quarter GDP growth plunging from nearly 4% in January to -2.4% last week.Any reversal in economic growth expectations would spark a swift rally in equities, according to Kostin.\"We believe investors will require either a catalyst that improves the economic growth outlook or clear asymmetry to the upside before they try to 'catch the falling knife' and reverse the recent market momentum,\" Kostin said.Improving economic data or a change in the Trump administration's tariff policy are candidates that could spark such a rally.The stock market got a brief taste of this on Wednesday when a cooler-than-expected February CPI report sparked a 1% rally in the S&P 500.Valuations have to hit attractive levelsKostin wants to see stock market valuations price in economic growth that is \"well below\" the bank's baseline forecast.That's starting to happen.The S&P 500 is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 20.1x, which is slightly below Goldman's estimate for the multiple to be at 20.6x at the end of the year.Meanwhile, the mega-cap tech stocks are trading at their lowest valuation premium to the rest of the S&P 500 components since 2017.\"The market is currently trading close to fair value,\" Kostin said.Assuming economic growth doesn't deteriorate significantly, a further decline in valuations could present an attractive opportunity for investors. Depressed investor positioningBullish sentiment among investors has crashed amid the stock market sell-off.The CNN Fear & Greed Index is at \"Extreme Fear\" levels, while the AAII Investor Sentiment survey has seen bearish responses explode to the highest level since the 2022 bear market.Goldman Sachs' proprietary sentiment indicator has declined sharply form elevated levels to about \"neutral,\" Kostin said.A further decline to \"deeply negative\" levels would be a statistically significant signal for above-average equity market returns.Goldman SachsKostin's year-end S&P 500 price target of 6,200 represents potential upside of 11% from current levels and would represent a record high for the benchmark index.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs is maintaining its overweight calls on China H-shares and A-shares — those listed in Hong Kong and on the mainland, respectively. China's stock markets started 2025 on a bull run.Zhang Peng/LightRocket/Getty ImagesUS stock market concerns are prompting investors to reconsider Chinese equities.China's stock markets are seeing historic gains after years of underperformance.Goldman Sachs highlighted China's tech advances and reduced regulatory risks.The US stock market skidded last week over concerns about a potential recession — and it's making some investors consider China again.The change in tune comes on the back of a bull run in China's stock markets. The MSCI China Index is up 20% so far this year, marking the best start of the year in history for Chinese stocks. The strong gains come after several years of dismal performance.Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note that global mutual funds — who are typically long-only investors — may \"rekindle their interest in and sponsorship for Chinese equities.\" Over the last three years, these investors largely sat out rallies and reduced their exposures.\"Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts.They wrote that investors are also considering Chinese stocks because of China's technological breakthroughs and reduced regulatory uncertainty.The analysts estimate markets could see $8 billion worth of net buying in Chinese equities if global mutual funds up their allocation to the asset class by just 1 percentage point.The MSCI China Index's gains have outperformed developed and emerging markets by well over 10%.Goldman Sachs is maintaining its overweight calls on China H-shares and A-shares — those listed in Hong Kong and on the mainland, respectively. However, the analysts wrote that they expect China's bull run to slow and profit-taking pressures to emerge as US-China geopolitical tensions continue.Goldman Sachs also repeated its stance that China's current market rally is different from a short-lived September surge in Chinese stocks that was driven by an aggressive stimulus blitz from Beijing. September's policy pivot reduced downside risks for stocks, but recent developments in China's tech space are a game-changer, the analysts wrote.The boost in Chinese tech stocks is thanks to the recent rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that released a cost-competitive AI model.This development flipped the narrative for Chinese Big Tech stocks that were previously under pressure from a state-led crackdown. It suggests that Chinese tech may present serious challenges to capital-intensive AI development that has long been dominated by Western firms.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index has surged about 32% so far this year. Stocks of tech giants Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have jumped 66%, 27%, and 12%, respectively.\"The latest technology breakthroughs are more micro- and innovation-driven in nature, and are beneficial to earnings as well as to valuations, which might give the recovery more staying power than those that were purely driven by liquidity and policy expectation repricing,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider",

He was made governor in 2008, at the start of the global financial crisis.

        "description": "As AI infrastructure and hardware makers struggle in 2025, Goldman Sachs says investors should look to other corners of the sector for opportunities. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIGoldman Sachs is eyeing software stocks as a bright spot in an otherwise slumping AI trade.So-called \"phase 3\" AI stocks are showing strength in sales revisions.AI Infrastructure names are navigating a difficult year amid macro volatility and tech headwinds.A slate of bad news has weighed on the artificial intelligence trade this year, but investors shouldn't turn their back on the space yet. While tech shares have been shaken by macroeconomic volatility and industry headwinds, a growing corner of AI-exposed stocks is flashing a strong signal. According to Goldman Sachs, software companies likely to benefit from emerging AI tech are experiencing positive sales revisions year-to-date, in contrast to other areas of AI.Expected consensus 2026 sales have been revised 0.3% higher year-to-date for these \"phase 3\" stocks. Compared to this, phase 2 equities — stocks related to AI infrastructure — have seen consensus sales revised 0.3% lower.The downside revision is the same for phase 4 stocks, a group expected to rise from AI's labor productivity gains.\"We continue to believe that AI Phase 3 offers better risk/reward for new capital than AI Phase 2,\" Goldman said in a Thursday note. \"As the cost of AI continues to decline, we expect investors will begin to seek companies with AI-enabled revenues. Even after the sell-off, the relative valuation of AI Phase 2 stocks is still slightly above its historical average, while AI Phase 3 stocks trade slightly inexpensive vs. history.\"Here are the software stocks that Goldman expects will notch the fastest sales growth in the next two years, with estimates for their compound annual sales growth rate between 2024 and 2026.Palantir Technologies: 29%Cloudflare: 26%SentinelOne: 25%Axon Enterprise: 24%Snowflake: 23%CrowdStrike: 22%The bank's optimism offers a silver lining in what's been a gloomy period for the tech trade, with phase 2 stocks falling out of favor.The sector has soared since 2022 on the rapid buildout of AI infrastructure, which boosted demand for semiconductors and related hardware. But this year's growing rivalry from China's tech sector, paired with concern about overloaded valuations, has pushed these equities into negative territory.The main concern is that rising AI efficiencies will weigh on hardware demand, calling into question the massive spending levels by AI hyperscalers. This is pressuring down chipmakers: since mid-February, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index has dropped nearly 15%.Even positive earnings aren't enough to shore up confidence. A fourth-quarter beat from the kingpin chipmaker Nvidia did little to slow the fall in its share price this year. The leading AI firm is now trading in a bear market, down 20% from its February high.\"We believe washed-out positioning or an improvement in the economic data will be required for the recent rotations to reverse,\" Goldman wrote. \"Alternatively, the equity market would benefit from an easing of tariff policy, but uncertainty remains high.\"Meanwhile, the bank noted that phase 4 beneficiaries are already emerging, referring to companies that are starting to identify productivity benefits from AI. The bank pointed to names including Amazon, Cognizant Technology Solutions, and Iqvia Holdings.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The plan, which has been nicknamed \"Project Voyage,\" kicked off in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be rolled out over a number of years, according to a former Goldman employee, who was not authorized to speak to the press and asked to remain anonymous.

Employees who routinely fail to comply with Goldman's five-day-per-week office attendance policy, for example, could be vulnerable to a cut through the SRA —particularly if they're found to be underperforming in their job.This year's SRA, however, will be informed to some degree by \"Project Voyage,\" the ex-Goldman insider said. The bank's vice presidents — a title that sits between associate and managing directors — will be eyed for cuts in good part because of Project Voyage, which has pinned this group as too large. As BI reported on Wednesday, Goldman's VP ranks have become so bloated that its VPs have been increasingly reporting to other VPs rather than managing directors. Compensation for client-facing VPs can reach $1 million, including base salary and bonuses, the former employee estimated.In addition to thinning out bloated parts of the organizational chart, Project Voyage will pinpoint employees to relocate from Goldman's New York City headquarters, located in lower Manhattan, to lower-cost locations such as Dallas, Texas; and Salt Lake City, Utah, according to people familiar with the program.The plan also calls for jobs lost through the SRA to be backfilled in lower-cost locations rather than New York, this person said.

According to the report, a Goldman […] The post Report: Goldman Sachs to Reduce Staff by Up to 5% in Annual Review appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to cut 3% to 5% of its staff in an annual review process. The cut would amount to about 1,395 jobs and would be a larger reduction than the one the Wall Street firm made during a review in September, Reuters reported Tuesday (March 4), citing unnamed sources. According to the report, a Goldman Sachs spokesman did not give details about the move but said: “This is part of our normal, annual talent management process.” It was reported in August that Goldman Sachs’ annual review process typically cuts between 2% and 7% of its workforce, with the percentage changing in different years depending on the bank’s financial outlook and overall market conditions. When plans for layoffs were announced at that time, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the bank’s total headcount was expected to remain higher at the end of 2024 than it was in 2023. “Our annual talent reviews are normal, standard and customary, but otherwise unremarkable,” Goldman Sachs spokesperson Tony Fratto told the WSJ on Aug. 30. Goldman Sachs made several rounds of workforce reductions in 2023 amid a decline in dealmaking and the firm’s exit from a consumer business, according to Tuesday’s Reuters report. More recently, deals and market activity have picked up, and Goldman Sachs reported a three-year high in quarterly profits in January, per the report. Goldman Sachs earned higher net revenues across all segments in the fourth quarter, the bank said in a Jan. 15 earnings report. It saw year-over-year gains of 33% in Global Banking & Markets, 8% in Asset & Wealth Management and 16% in Platform Solutions. In a presentation released in conjunction with its quarterly earnings call, Goldman Sachs attributed the growth in part to higher net revenues in equity underwriting and debt underwriting and in intermediation and financing in the Global Banking & Markets business. “There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the U.S. election,” CEO David Solomon said during the call. “Additionally, there is a significant backlog from sponsors and an overall increased appetite for deal-making supported by an improved regulatory backdrop. The combination of these conditions should spur further activity in 2025.” The post Report: Goldman Sachs to Reduce Staff by Up to 5% in Annual Review appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",
