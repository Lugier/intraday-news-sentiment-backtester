        "description": "The outlook for earnings is brightening, Morgan Stanley CIO Mike Wilson said. More upward revisions has historically led to 13% boost for the S&P 500. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley is growing more optimistic about the stock market as earnings revisions breadth improves.Improving breadth is being driven by more upward revisions, the bank said. The market is likely to overlook softer hard data in favor of forward-looking views of strong earnings. The vibes in the stock market are improving, and it's boosting the case for prices to rise from here. That's according to a note from Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson. The bank's CIO and chief stock strategist pointed to a key signal that's sending a bullish signal: a sharp rebound in earnings revisions breadth, or the proportion of analysts who have raised their estimates minus the proportion who have lowered them.The indicator is now at -10%, a noticeable improvement from -25% during the height of tariff uncertainty in April, an indication that sentiment is recovering. Morgan StanleyThe bank believes the indicator will continue to trend upward. A weak dollar could further bolster this earnings gauge, as US companies that do a lot of business overseas receive a boost in sales when the dollar is weaker. Once earnings revisions breadth turns positive, investors should expect forward EPS predictions to trend higher.Earnings revision breadth can be driven by either fewer downward revisions or more upward revisions. According to Morgan Stanley, the latter is the case today, which is good news for investors. More upward revisions tend to result in stronger overall stock market performance, historically leading to a 13% increase in the S&P 500 over a 12-month span. When fewer downward revisions are the driving factor, the S&P 500 has historically returned 8% over the next 12 months.Morgan Stanley's 12-month price target for the S&P 500 is 6,500, a potential gain of 8% from current levels.Investors should pay more attention to the improvement in forward-looking earnings revision breadth rather than lagging hard data, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank sees April stock market lows as the end of a year-long trend of downward earnings revisions, and expects the rate of change on earnings revision breadth to be the primary driver of equity prices going forward.\"In our experience, when revisions breadth is accelerating in a V-shaped manner from an extreme low, equity markets typically remain supported and pullbacks remain shallow and unsatisfying (like the past 6 weeks),\" Wilson wrote.The recent outperformance of cyclical stocks also points to a market more focused on forward-looking earnings revisions than backward-looking hard data. These areas of the market are especially sensitive to economic growth and earnings, and they're picking up momentum and providing a tailwind to the overall stock market.While it's possible that inflation could creep up over the summer as the pull-forward effect of tariffs fades, Morgan Stanley believes the bulk of the tariff pain appears to be already priced in following the April 2 tariff announcements. Policy headwinds should ease soon, as Trump's term began by front-loading disruptive tariff policies and will transition to more pro-growth initiatives like deregulation and tax cuts.Over the last month, the market has has rallied over 20% from April lows despite a first quarter GDP contraction weakening manufacturing data. As long as earnings revisions breadth continues trending upwards, Morgan Stanley believes the stock market will continue to overlook short term weakness in hard data.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The US Dollar Index has fallen more than 10% since mid-January. Morgan Stanley strategists think a range of factors will send it lower in the coming months. The US dollar has been under pressure this year. Chuck Savage/Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley predicts the US Dollar Index will fall by 9% over the next 12 months.The bank's strategists cite factors such as interest rate cuts and the rising strength of other currencies.Some investors are doubting the dollar's enduring status as a safe-haven asset.Morgan Stanley thinks the dollar has further to fall — to levels last reached during the pandemic — driven lower by interest rate cuts and the strength of rival currencies.Strategists at the investment bank wrote in a report published over the weekend that they anticipate a 9% fall over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index.The index measures the value against a basket of six currencies: the euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, and Swedish krona.They said the greenback had declined faster than expected, already slumping to its year-end target price of 101 last month. It stood at 98.9 on Tuesday.The dollar's weakness is forecast to be most acute against safe-haven currencies such as the euro, yen, and franc, according to Morgan Stanley.\"We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges,\" the strategists said.They forecast a rise in the value of the euro against the dollar to $1.25 and the pound to $1.45 by mid-2026.The US dollar index has fallen more than 10% since its mid-January highs of almost 110 reached soon before the inauguration of President Donald Trump and based on the expectation of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The index rose again in February, but has since reversed course amid Trump's tariffs and ensuing trade war.The strategists forecast the yield on 10-year Treasurys to stand at 4% by the end of this year. \"Treasury yields stage a much larger decline in 2026 as the Fed delivers 175 basis points of rate cuts on the back of weaker real growth and inflation moving back to target,\" they wrote.Morgan Stanley expects US GDP growth to come in at 1% both this year and in 2026. \"Beyond tariffs, immigration restrictions also weigh on US growth, while we are skeptical of meaningful support from fiscal policy or deregulation,\" its economists wrote.The OECD said on Tuesday that the US economy would expand by 1.6% in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 2.8%.Read the original article on Business Insider",

My first reaction was to simply ask: Why would I trade a large opportunity for what seemed like a smaller one?The co-head of my division at the time and the champion for this career move was David Solomon, who also happens to be my current boss, and he was quick to point out that I was looking at the opportunity the wrong way. It was not about trading from a big business to a small business but rather seizing an opportunity that could make a meaningful difference for the firm.His guidance reframed my thinking. I moved to London, and over the ensuing years for a variety of reasons, our European financing business grew significantly.The push to move to London was not only a great career move for me, but also enhanced our ability to compete in EMEA. The lesson was equally important: Trust the firm, trust the people you work with, and be willing to take risks with your career. That's how you end up making a difference.When I was a junior analyst at Goldman Sachs, I was given a piece of tactical advice that would shape how I looked at career development: If you are looking to accelerate your career, identify the aspects of your boss's job or the tasks they are responsible for that don't necessarily require their personal oversight, and offer to take on the responsibility.You will free your manager from some of their less strategic tasks, enabling them to spend more time and energy on the things that benefit the business the most. In addition, as a more junior party, taking on these responsibilities will give you an opportunity to gain exposure to things that a more senior person is usually tasked with.You need to work hard and do your job with excellence, but you can separate yourself by volunteering to take on more to develop your skills and free up the time of those above you.Lauren BelmonteFirm: Morgan StanleyTitle: Head of technology equity capital markets in the Americas, managing directorMorgan Stanley's head of technology equity capital markets in the Americas, Lauren Belmonte.Courtesy of Morgan StanleyWhen I started working at Morgan Stanley as an associate out of business school, I had the fortunate opportunity to partner with Jim Runde — a legendary banker on Wall Street with a multi-decade career. I met him at the stage in his career where he was focused on developing talent across our investment banking teams.In our regular coffee catchups, he would share very practical, actionable advice including on building relationships with clients (\"of course, turn up prepared and ready to ask for the business, but always turn up to meetings early\") or on building trust in a team (\"praise in public, criticize in private\").One piece of advice that has been very impactful to my career was his focus on seeking out opportunities with smart, interesting people. He would say, \"If someone you respect asks you to go sharpen pencils for them, you should do it.\"This advice has stuck with me in part because the example itself is extreme — nobody is sharpening pencils at Morgan Stanley — but also because it aligns with my experiences to date.Jim's counsel was that it matters who you are around and not the specific task you are focused on. I actively seek out opportunities with varied colleagues at Morgan Stanley as well as with clients across industries because of his advice. There is no doubt that opportunities arise from working with dynamic people and it brings out the best in you. Now as I lead our technology IPO business, I look to partner with energetic founders and insightful investors as it brings out the best in my work, and it also keeps me learning and growing.Have a tip?

The […] The post Reports: xAI Launches $5 Billion Debt Sale and $300 Million Share Sale appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, reportedly launched a $5 billion debt sale and a $300 million share sale. The $5 billion debt sale was launched Monday (June 2) through Morgan Stanley, with commitments due June 17, and its proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The $300 million share sale will allow staffers to sell their shares to new investors, the Financial Times (FT) reported Monday, citing unnamed sources. It values xAI at $113 billion, equal to the valuation it achieved in March when it acquired Musk’s social media platform, X, according to the report. XAI did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment on the two reports. Musk announced xAI’s acquisition of X March 28, saying the deal valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). “XAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in a March 28 post on X. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.” It was reported in November that xAI raised $5 billion in a funding round that valued it at $50 billion. That financing brought the total amount raised by xAI at that point in 2024 to $11 billion, while the funding round more than doubled the company’s valuation from the $24 billion at which it was valued in spring 2024. XAI said at the time that it planned to use that funding to add another 100,000 Nvidia chips for training its AI models. Monday’s reports came about a week after Musk said he is back to working 24/7 at his companies and “super focused” on them after months of heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) created by President Donald Trump. “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk wrote in a May 24 post on X. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley rejected fears that Treasurys were no longer safe havens and said rising bond yields were a global issue, not just a US problem. Treasury yields have been rising in recent days.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesJim Caron said the investor concern implied by rising bond yields is overdone.Yields on US Treasurys spiked this past week in response to President Donald Trump's tax bill.The Morgan Stanley strategist said the fiscal deficit has long been a well-known issue.The recent surge in US bond yields is overblown, said a chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley.He's referring to yields on 10- and 30-year US Treasurys, which rose as high as 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively, this past week. The increases came after the decision by Moody's to downgrade its rating on US debt on May 16, and accelerated in the following week on concerns over the sweeping budget bill advancing through Congress.While commentators have said fears about the swelling budget deficit are behind the week's bond-market jitters, Jim Caron, chief investment officer of the portfolio solutions group at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Business Insider he thinks the issue is being blown out of proportion.He said markets were already aware that the national deficit is a problem, so Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" that passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday isn't really the issue.Caron said he refers to those who believe Treasurys could lose their safe-haven status as \"tourists in the market.\"Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.Morgan StanleyThe GOP's sweeping budget bill aims to extend the 2017 tax cuts, slash Medicaid spending and supplemental nutrition assistance, and increase military spending. Estimates vary, but the bill could add as much as $4 trillion to the government's deficit over the next 10 years.Caron doesn't necessarily think a widening deficit will erode the perception of Treasurys as ultra-safe investments.\"I wouldn't say that there's a straight line connection to some of the deficit and tax talk,\" he said. \"And that's kind of what everybody's trying to conflate and put together.\"\"I think it would be refreshing to absolutely take a deeper look at that and just say, 'look, the fiscal situation is not new news,'\" Caron said.The IMF expects the US federal deficit to dip from 7.3% of GDP last year to 6.5% this year.\"The market is creating excess hysteria around it,\" Caron said of the deficit debate.The Morgan Stanley strategist argued that rising bond yields are a global issue, and not just a US problem. Long-dated bonds in the UK, Germany, and Japan have soared this year on fears over those countries' fiscal outlooks.\"I always find it to be a very novice explanation when people say, 'oh, I think the US is losing its status and the dollar is going to lose its reserve status,'\" Caron said. \"If that were actually even 1% true, the markets would be selling off in a massive, massive way.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Investors are selling American assets over fears of a swelling budget deficit. Morgan Stanley says the trend is unsustainable. TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesThe \"sell America\" trade has been in full force in recent days.But Morgan Stanley is still bullish on US stocks and bonds over the next year.The firm says a Fed cuts, and AI gains will all boost stocks.The \"sell America\" trade has hit US assets in recent days as investors have gotten jittery over what a new spending bill will mean for the federal deficit.The S&P 500 has dropped about 1% over the past two days, while the 10-year Treasury yield — which trades inversely to bond prices — has spiked 10 basis points in just four days. Despite the recent selling of US assets, a team of strategists at Morgan Stanley expect them to rebound and outperform global peers over the next year. \"We push back against the idea that foreign investors would or should abandon US assets significantly,\" they wrote.Part of their reasoning is simply that there aren't superior options.\"TINA — 'there is no alternative' — remains a theme for now,\" the strategists said.Detailed below is the rationale for the firm's bullish outlooks on both US stocks and bonds.StocksWhile volatility will continue to dominate over the next two quarters, American indexes should defy current trends through the next year. By the second quarter of 2026, the firm expects the S&P 500 to hit 6,500, which represents 10% upside from current levels.\"The earnings path should be aided by Fed rate cuts in 2026, dollar weakness, as well as a broader realization of AI-driven efficiency gains,\" the bank wrote.Meanwhile, de-escalating trade tensions have removed the largest downside scenarios, meaning that the market is unlikely to retest April lows any time soon, Morgan Stanley wrote. An accommodating policy agenda and seven interest rate cuts in 2026 should boost valuations above average.BondsEven as the yield on 10-year Treasurys climb, Morgan Stanley sees it as a temporary trend. It expects rangebound trading until the fourth quarter, at which point investors will start pricing in rate cuts for 2026.The bank expects the 10-year yield to fall to 3.45% by the middle of 2026.Morgan Stanley also pushed against the idea investors are dumping US assets in a more permanent retreat, something that seemed possible during the April's tariff-induced chaos.\"Global equity funds have not shifted away from the US any more than index weight changes over the last quarter,\" analysts wrote. \"The amount of USD bonds held by foreigners is the highest ever, suggesting that there are still rest-of-world buyers of USD assets — especially high-quality USD assets.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Stocks have rallied since April, but the gains will fad as tech stumbles. A top exec says investors should eye beneficiaries of deregulation instead. Bruce Yuanyue Bi/Getty ImagesThe stock market rally will \"stall out,\" Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett said.The Magnificent 7 stocks will lose momentum amid decelerating growth and dropping cash levels.Shalett suggested a turn toward beneficiaries of deregulation.Stocks have rallied sharply since April lows but investors shouldn't treat the upside as a blueprint for what's to come, a top Wall Street exec warned last week. Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said she expects slower momentum going forward among key tech stocks. That will jeopardize a sustained rally, she said. \"I think we're going to stall out here. I think it's just hard to justify the numbers,\" she told Bloomberg TV on Friday, emphasizing that the top S&P 500 leaders are trading back at highs from earlier in the year despite a 6% earnings-per-share drawdown.Even for those who still believe the Magnificent Seven stocks' outperformance will last, Shalett listed three reasons to reconsider their bullishness.There's the fact that top-line growth has decelerated, as has free-cash-flow, she said. Typically, Mag Seven stocks don't perform well when the latter declines — the \"arms race\" to spend on AI has already shrunk free-cash-flow 11%, Shalett outlined.What's more, investors shouldn't forget the wall of uncertainty that still surrounds artificial intelligence, especially in terms of AI competition. Despite current market euphoria, this year's DeepSeek surprise shouldn't be discounted, showcasing that international AI competition is rising. \"We fundamentally think it was the wake-up call around global engineering, global innovation, and the fact that none of us know how the movie ends here on Gen AI,\" Shalett said.Convinced that the AI rally is losing steam, Shalett suggested that investors take profits in tech now and gain exposure to the next beneficiaries: stocks set to rise on industry deregulation. That includes financials, energy, and certain healthcare names.Shalett's forecast isn't necessarily shared by everyone on Wall Street, with opinions split on what comes next after the recent tariff euphoria. Trade deals have revived investor bullishness, sending the S&P 500 up 19% from April's lowest point.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Morgan Stanley says now is not the time to abandon US stocks, especially large-cap names in the S&P 500. Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 5, 2020.Andrew Kelly/ReutersMorgan Stanley advises investors to favor large-cap stocks as the economic outlook remains muddled.Large caps offer better pricing power and efficiency, acting defensively in late economic cycles.Here's what Morgan Stanley is recommending to investors with uncertainty still looming.With trade tensions volatile amid President Donald Trump's tariff policies, Morgan Stanley has laid out a clear playbook for investors looking to navigate the growing uncertainty.In a Monday note, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Mike Wilson broke down where investors should rotate their investments to better shield themselves from the global trade risks.Here's what the bank's chief investment officer thinks you should do with your portfolio.1. Go big: Favor large caps over small capsLarge-cap stocks offer investors better pricing power and operational efficiency compared to small-cap stocks, Wilson said.In addition, large-cap stocks typically act more defensively than small-cap stocks during late economic cycles, which Wilson believes we're in.\"Small caps have more economic sensitivity and more rate sensitivity,\" Wilson said. \"Given the slowing macro backdrop, a Fed that's on hold and sticky back-end rates, large caps should continue to see relative outperformance.\"2. Swap consumer staples for healthcareHealthcare stocks are trading at a massive discount to the S&P 500 and an even bigger discount to consumer staples stocks.That means for investors seeking defensive exposure, there's better value in healthcare names.Investors view the healthcare sector as defensive because people typically continue to spend on healthcare even when the economy enters a downturn.Within the healthcare sector, Wilson said the biotech industry looks particularly de-risked.On the other hand, Wilson said, given their high valuations, consumer staples stocks may not provide investors with the defense they seek.\"Besides more expensive valuation, Staples is also more exposed to a slowing consumer and generally has limited pricing power/slimmer margins,\" Wilson said.3. Buy industrials over consumer discretionaryFor investors seeking cyclical exposure to the stock market, the industrials sector offers a better deal than consumer discretionary.That's because industrial companies typically have stronger pricing power relative to consumer discretionary companies, which are at the mercy of the consumer's health.Additionally, industrial stocks are less directly exposed to tariffs set against China and Vietnam, and they have benefited from the USMCA tariff exemptions on Mexico.\"Finally, it has structural exposure to an infrastructure build out, which appears to be a policy priority for this administration,\" Wilson said.4. Lean into qualityWhen the economic cycle is aging and growth is slowing, Morgan Stanley says investors should move up the \"quality curve.\" That means favoring companies with:Lower debtHigh operational efficiencyStable earnings and margin profilesAccording to Wilson, that's especially true in a slowing economic cycle in which the Federal Reserve isn't cutting interest rates.\"Late in the cycle, it pays to stay up the quality curve,\" the strategists said.5. Stick with US over international stocksDespite rising calls for a structural rotation into international markets, Morgan Stanley says now is not the time to abandon US stocks, especially large-cap names in the S&P 500.That's because of the higher quality nature of the US stock market relative to overseas markets.\"This is the type of backdrop where higher quality areas of the market and indices (the S&P 500) tend to outperform on a relative basis,\" Wilson said.Specifically, now is a time when quality growth attributes are rewarded as the cyclical impulse slows down.\"US large cap indices stand out positively in this regard with more significant quality growth weights and lower volatility of earnings growth,\" Wilson said.With global uncertainty rising, the tried-and-true stability of US markets may still offer the best relative returns.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Financial service companies such as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are training their staff on internal AI tools that still need human management. Getty Images; Karan Singh for BISome financial institutions are prioritizing internal AI tools to enhance daily operations.For example, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have trained staff to use AI with human supervision.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.The financial industry's approach to artificial intelligence reveals considerable pragmatism.Popular notions of generative AI, guided by the explosive growth of OpenAI's ChatGPT, often center on consumer-facing chatbots. But financial institutions are leaning more heavily on internal AI tools that streamline day-to-day tasks.This requires training programs and user-experience design that help a bank's entire organization — from relationship bankers directing high-value accounts to associates — understand the latest AI technology.From AI classification to AI generationBanks have long used traditional AI and machine learning techniques for various functions, such as customer service bots and decision algorithms that provide a faster-than-human response to market swings.But modern generative AI is different from prior AI/ML methods, and it has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hari Gopalkrishnan, Bank of America's chief information officer and head of retail, preferred, small business, and wealth technology, said generative AI is a new tool that offers new capabilities, rather than a replacement for prior AI efforts.\"We have a four-layer framework that we think about with regards to AI,\" Gopalkrishnan told Business Insider.The first layer is rules-based automation that takes actions based on specific conditions, like collecting and preserving data about a declined credit card transaction when one occurs. The second is analytical models, such as those used for fraud detection. The third layer is language classification, which Bank of America used to build Erica, a virtual financial assistant, in 2016.\"Our journey of Erica started off with understanding language for the purposes of classification,\" Gopalkrishnan said. But the company isn't generating anything with Erica, he added: \"We're classifying customer questions into buckets of intents and using those intents to take customers to the right part of the app or website to help them serve themselves.\"The fourth layer, of course, is generative AI.Koren Picariello, a Morgan Stanley managing director and its head of wealth management generative AI, said Morgan Stanley took a similar path. Throughout the 2010s, the company used machine learning for several purposes, like seeking investment opportunities that meet the needs and preferences of specific clients. Many of these techniques are still used.\"Historically, I was working in analytics, data, and innovation within the wealth space. In that space, Morgan Stanley did focus on the more traditional AI/ML tools,\" Picariello told BI. \"Then in 2022, we started a dialogue with OpenAI before they became a household name. And that began our generative-AI journey.\"How banks are deploying AIGiven the history, it'd be reasonable to think banks would turn generative-AI tools into new chatbots that more or less serve as better versions of Bank of America's Erica, or as autonomous financial advisors. But the most immediate changes instead came to internal processes and tools.Morgan Stanley's first major generative-AI tool, Morgan Stanley Assistant, was launched in September 2023 for employees such as financial advisors and support staff who help clients manage their money. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, it was designed to give responses grounded in the company's library of over 100,000 research reports and documents.The second tool, Morgan Stanley Debrief, was launched in June. It helps financial advisors create, review, and summarize notes from meetings with clients.\"It's kind of like having the most informed person at Morgan Stanley sitting next to you,\" Picariello said. \"Because any question you have, whether it was operational in nature or research in nature, what we've asked the model to do is source an answer to the user based on our internal content.\"Bank of America is pursuing similar applications, including a call center tool that saves customer associates' time by transcribing customer conversations in real time, classifying the customer's needs, and generating a summary for the agent.Keeping humans in the loopThe decision to deploy generative AI internally first, rather than externally, was in part due to generative AI's most notable weakness: hallucinations.In generative AI, a hallucination is an inaccurate or nonsensical response to a prompt, like when Google Search's AI infamously recommended that home chefs use glue to keep cheese from sliding off a pizza.Banks are wary of consumer-facing AI chatbots that could make similar errors about bank products and policies.Deploying generative AI internally lessens the concern. It's not used to autonomously serve a bank's customers and clients but to assist bank employees, who have the option to accept or reject its advice or assistance.Bank of America provides AI tools that can help relationship bankers prep for a meeting with a client, but it doesn't aim to automate the bank-client relationship, Gopalkrishnan told BI.Picariello said Morgan Stanley takes a similar approach to using generative AI while maintaining accuracy. The company's AI-generated meeting summaries could be automatically shared with clients, but they're not. Instead, financial advisors review them before they're sent.Training the finance workforce for AIBank of America and Morgan Stanley are also training bank employees on how to use generative-AI tools, though their strategies diverge.Gopalkrishnan said Bank of America takes a top-down approach to educating senior leadership about the potential and risks of generative AI.About two years ago, he told BI, he helped top-level staff at the bank become \"well aware\" of what's possible with AI. He said having the company's senior leadership briefed on generative AI's perks, as well as its limitations, was important to making informed decisions across the company.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is concentrating on making the company's AI tools easy to understand.\"We've spent a lot of time thinking through the UX associated with these tools, to make them intuitive to use, and taking users through the process and cycle of working with generative AI,\" Picariello said. \"Much of the training is built into the workflow and the user experience.\" For example, Morgan Stanley's tools can advise employees on how to reframe or change a prompt to yield a better response.For now, banks are focusing AI initiatives on identifying and automating increasingly more complex and nuanced tasks within the organizations rather than developing one-off applications targeted at the customer experience.\"We try to approach problems not as a technology problem but as a business problem. And the business problem is that Bank of America employees all perform lots of tasks in the company,\" said Gopalkrishnan. \"The opportunity is to think more holistically, to understand the tasks and find the biggest opportunities so that five and 10 years from now, we're a far more efficient organization.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

An example of that trend is Hina Shamsi, the chief technology officer for the divisions that serve Morgan Stanley's wealth management and institutional businesses.Shamsi, who also sits on the technology operating committee that drives tech and strategy across the firm, tells us about her career path and what she believes people should know about a career in technology at a bank. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shamsi, who's based in New York City. It has been edited for length and clarity.I'm of South Asian descent. I grew up in Kuwait and Pakistan in a very conservative environment with very forward-thinking parents. I was the first in my family to leave home and go to North America for higher education.If you had asked me years ago: Did I see myself on Wall Street as a chief technology officer? I would have said no.I went to school at the University of Texas at Austin. I got a degree in mathematics and then a master's in operations research with a focus on computer science. Think about operations research as the mother of the modern-day AI used in solving large-scale problems. There were a couple of industries where this was being done, like the defense industry, airlines, and, to some extent, healthcare.I always knew that I wanted to solve really big, hairy mathematical problems.A friend in the airline industry told me his work was very much related to my academic background. I took a call from his company, Sabre. It's headquartered near Dallas and is very big in creating systems that help airlines plan out and optimize schedules, routes, and other decisions.I took the job and fell in love with the industry. I spent almost 17 years in it before I got my first call from a financial services firm. See more stories from BI's Path to Wall Street series here, including what firms young people want to work for today, data showing where the average banker went to school, and what it's really like to work for a hedge fund. What attracted me to finance was the enormous opportunity it presented for innovation and transformation. This is a very dynamic industry, and it continues to mature. There's never a dull moment.As a technology leader, you get an opportunity to work on wide-ranging emerging tech, like machine learning and artificial intelligence — you name it. But you also get to solve some of the most challenging business problems, as evidenced by our work rolling out our first two generative-AI products for financial advisors, in partnership with OpenAI.Learning the businessLike the very large-scale systems I worked on in airlines, fintech is a very complex environment. There are high-scale, high-availability transactional systems. So my technology experience lent itself really nicely to financial services.But I didn't know about the business. I had to learn it.I read every material that was available to me in the bank's enormous amount of training content. But I think you can only go so far reading on your own.I sat down with business leaders to really probe what's top of mind for them, the problems they are thinking about: What are your top three? You always want to have a pulse on what your industry is thinking about.The second thing I did, which I really encourage people to do, is not just talking to senior people. Sometimes you get the best information by talking to people who are on the ground working on problems day in and day out. Whether you're sitting with the financial advisor and just watching them take a call, or you're sitting on the trading floor at an equity desk watching a trader use technology — there's no better way to know how good or bad your technology is until you observe it being used.Even today, I take the time to sit with a financial advisor and ask them what their pain points are, what they like, and what they don't like. You'll be surprised how much you learn from putting yourself in their shoes.Encouraging 'healthy debate' between tech and business leadersToday, technologists have a bigger role in shaping the business through its products and the strategy itself, not just the execution.Long gone are the days when requirements came through over the wall and we were told, \"Go develop this.\"I can't underscore enough how important it is for us to be involved in the business-case development. The company leaders understand the business well, but they don't understand the art of the possible; they don't understand technology well. I describe it this way: The heads of the lines of business know the \"what\" and the \"why,\" but they don't understand the \"how.\" That is where the technology comes in.Sometimes, business needs and technical realities don't align. It's a healthy debate, and it's critical to the creative process.Business leaders have ideas and expectations that are sometimes, quite frankly, unreasonable because their role is to push and look at it from the customer's perspective. Then you also see technologists creating tech just for the sake of tech.When you bring those two together, that debate is really good for the creative process. We encourage that because we want diverse ideas, so that when we produce something, it's been thought through well.Advice for new gradsThe single most important thing a computer science student today can do to prepare for working in tech on Wall Street is to think more broadly about their role, not just as a technologist but also as a business technologist.What makes you stand out — and we interview thousands of candidates every year — is the niche skills, like expertise on cloud, as well as any experience with AI and machine learning. Those are the skills we're looking for.Once you have the technical skills, the next step is to focus on learning the business through tangible experiences, like internships, as early as possible. Develop the skills you learned academically, and apply them to business-specific environments with the security and data privacy guardrails.Complement the business mindset with the technical knowledge, and that's where you maximize the value.Want to share your career path with us?

        "description": "The dollar has plunged to its lowest level in years recently, but that could be a boon for US corporate earnings, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said. VCG/VCG via Getty ImagesThe dollar's sharp decline could help US stocks outperform, analyst Michael Wilson wrote.The greenback hit a three-year low amid tariff jitters this month.Investors should stay invested in quality US large caps, Wilson said.As Wall Street voices fears over the potential for US assets to lose their edge against international peers, Morgan Stanley says a waning dollar could be the stock market's saving grace.The bank expects the greenback's recent decline to buoy US stocks against international equities, preserving \"US exceptionalism.\"\"From a global standpoint, we recommend favoring US over international equities as a weaker dollar should benefit large cap US relative EPS revisions (particularly versus Europe and Japan),\" according to analysts led by chief investment officer Michael Wilson.US indexes will also stand out due to less volatile earnings growth and higher quality bias.This month, the US Dollar Index hit a three-year low, as trade policy whiplash coincided with a sharp sell-off in US safe-haven trades. Tariff escalations and high levels of government debt have caused dollar demand to crash, despite early-year expectations for a stronger currency in 2025.Wilson was among those projecting greenback strength, initially warning late last year that a strong dollar could upend the S&P 500 rally.But the index went on to tumble early this year without the dollar's help, plunging toward bear market territory as tariffs ratcheted up uncertainty and volatility. The analysts now expect the S&P 500 to remain trading between 5,000 and 5,500 until specific developments pass. That includes a US tariff deal with China, interest rate cuts, lower bond yields, and a rebound in earnings revisions.For investors considering portfolio changes, the biggest takeaway is to stick to quality stocks.\"We remain in a late cycle backdrop where both quality and large cap relative outperformance should continue,\" Wilson wrote.\"While uncertainty persists and defensives should remain overweight in one's portfolio, we do think it makes sense to pick spots in high quality cyclicals that have already discounted a material slowdown in both macro conditions and earnings.\"Among the top names highlighted by Morgan Stanley are Duolingo, Citigroup, Pinterest, and PayPal.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "\"The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips,\" Morgan Stanley said. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks to a robot at the company's AI conference.JOSH EDELSON / AFPThe stock market's AI trade has waned this year amid tariffs and fears of an AI slowdin. But Morgan Stanley dismissed concerns of lower AI spending, citing continued demand for chips.\"We have been highlighting this strong inference demand recently but it continues to get stronger,\" Morgan Stanley said.One of Wall Street's top banks isn't worried about the artificial intelligence trade even as it struggles amid fears of lower investment by companies in 2025. \"The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note on Friday.Moore pointed to recent comments from OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai as evidence that AI companies still can't get enough GPU chips.\"While Wall Street wrings its hands over a laundry list of very real concerns, Silicon Valley focus has shifted to a very different challenge - growth in tokens generated of more than 5x since the beginning of the year is very much stressing the ecosystem, and is driving a surge in investment to handle those workloads,\" Moore explained.AI stocks have been particularly weak this year, a trend sparked by the late-January debut of DeepSeek's efficient large language model. The model sparked fears that cloud hyperscalers might need fewer GPU chips from Nvidia to develop their AI capabilities.The AI bubble fears grew after President Donald Trump unleashed a wave of tariffs in early April.Shares of AI darling Nvidia have plunged 28% since late January, and mega-cap tech giants closely tied to the AI trade are down about 21% since their peak just a few months ago.Turning to Nvidia, Moore admitted that supply constraints and export restrictions on its H20 chips would likely limit the company's revenue upside over the next few quarters. Still, once supply constraints are worked out, they should see a significant leg of growth in 2026.\"NVIDIA had almost no revenue for Blackwell in October, did $11 bn in January, and likely well over $30 bn in the current quarter,\" Moore said, adding that he doesn't expect the growth to slow down. anytime soon.\"Per our checks, this demand commentary has intensified in the last few days,\" Moore said. \"We have been highlighting this strong inference demand recently but it continues to get stronger.\"Moore increased his calendar year 2026 revenue and earnings per share estimates for Nvidia by 10.7% and 11.9%, respectively, adding that the chip giant remains a \"top pick.\"The analyst reiterated his \"Overweight\" rating on Nvidia and set a $160 price target, representing potential upside of 45% from current levels.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Consumers’ perception of Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) platform is more favorable than that of investors, Morgan Stanley said in a research note released Tuesday (April 22). In the note, which the company provided to PYMNTS, Morgan Stanley said it found that the Apple Intelligence platform has been downloaded and engaged with by 80% of eligible U.S. iPhone owners in the last six months, has an above average net promoter score of 53, and is characterized by iPhone users as “easy to use, innovative, and something that improves their user experience.” “While much of the public critique of Apple Intelligence is warranted, and investor sentiment and expectations on Apple’s AI platform couldn’t be lower, our survey of iPhone owners paints a more positive picture,” Morgan Stanley said in the note. The survey also found that since September, the share of iPhone owners who believe it is extremely or very important to have Apple Intelligence support on their next iPhone rose 15 points to reach 42%. Among iPhone owners who are likely to upgrade their device in the next 12 months, the percentage saying that about the AI platform rose 20 points to reach 54%, according to the note. Morgan Stanley also found that consumers are willing to pay more for Apple Intelligence than they were in September. Those who have used the AI platform are now willing to pay an average of $9.11 per month for it, a figure that’s 11% higher than the $8.17 average seen in September, per the note. “While we don’t expect Apple to put Apple Intelligence behind a paywall until the platform is more built out, the potential long-term monetization of an Apple Intelligence subscription could reach tens of billions of dollars annually when considering a 1.4B global iPhone installed base, 32% (and growing) of US iPhone owners have an Apple Intelligence support iPhone, and users are willing to pay up to $9.11/month for Apple Intelligence,” Morgan Stanley said in the note. Apple announced its suite of AI features in June, saying Apple Intelligence would revolutionize the iPhone,Mac and iPad experience, while keeping user data safe. The rollout of the offering over a period of months experienced some hiccups, including complaints that its AI summary tool was generating inaccurate headlines, leading Apple to remove the feature from its operating system.

        "description": "\"Earnings revisions breadth is now at levels rarely witnessed,\" Morgan Stanley wrote, adding that uncertainty is the highest since the pandemic. Michael Nagle/Xinhua via Getty ImagesXinhua News AgencyUS firms face the most uncertainty since the early COVID era, Morgan Stanley says.S&P 500 earnings revisions are approaching downside extremes.\"Earnings revisions breadth is now at levels rarely witnessed,\" Mike Wilson wrote.Companies are facing more uncertainty than they have in years, and the outlook for earnings is deteriorating at a rapid pace, Morgan Stanley said on Monday. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and looming recession fears are collectively weighing on earnings confidence and causing a vast revision of outlooks for corporate profitability.Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson notes that S&P 500 earnings revisions breadth — or the number of revisions of future profits — is at \"downside extremes.\"\"Earnings revisions breadth is now at levels rarely witnessed,\" Wilson wrote. \"S&P 500 revisions breadth [is] now approaching downside extremes (in the absence of a recession).\"Bloomberg Intelligence data found that estimates for earnings-per-share growth have dropped from 11.4% to 6.9% since the start of the year.Morgan StanleyEarnings revisions peaked nearly a year before the S&P 500 achieved its most recent record. \"This is why we are now more interested in looking at stocks/sectors that may have discounted a mild recession already even if the broader index has not,\" Wilson wrote. \"In short, if a recession is averted, markets likely made their lows 2 weeks ago.\"To be sure, there is still a risk that the S&P 500 tumbles further. Tariff policy whiplash and anxieties over economic growth have already sent stocks into bear market territory this month, and the S&P 500 could fall another 6% below the 4,800 level due to a handful of factors, including hawkish interest rate policy or a jump in the 10-year Treasury yield past 5%.Still, Morgan Stanley continues to bet on 5,000 to 5,500 as a reliable range for the index, at least until the current risks are either dismissed or confirmed by upcoming data.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "CEOs are slowing things down with one simple word: \"pause.\" Ted Pick, CEO of Morgan Stanley.Jeenah Moon/ReutersThis post originally appeared in the Business Insider Today newsletter.You can sign up for Business Insider's daily newsletter here.Good morning. Pope Francis, the 266th head of the Roman Catholic Church, died on Monday, just over 12 years after assuming the papacy. He was 88.In today's newsletter, we're focusing on how more and more CEOs are using the word \"pause\" when they talk about their businesses.What's on deckMarkets: Inside President Trump's ongoing feud with the Fed.Tech: Nvidia is the OG hardcore tech company.Business: Saudi Arabia's new airline plans to compete for first-class passengers.But first, welcome to the great pause.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.The big storyThe P-wordaristotoo/Getty, J Studios/Getty, Tyler Le/BICEOs are slowing things down with one simple word: \"pause.\"From small firms to industry giants like Morgan Stanley, CEOs are hitting the brakes amid growing uncertainty.For companies like Oxidizers, a pollution-control firm based near LA, this \"pause\" means holding off on major investments or hiring decisions until the full impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs becomes clearer.Megan Gluth, the CEO of Catalynt Solutions, said her materials company is pausing contracts amid global instability.Why has \"pause\" become the C-suite's new buzzword? It's a simple way to convey that companies are taking a beat before making weighty decisions that could appear rash in only a few months' time, BI's Tim Paradis writes.But a lasting delay could become problematic.Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, said pauses can go wrong. If adjusting to the new normal takes too long, companies' willingness to do deals and other normal activities could fade to where \"the pause effectively becomes a relook and the books get put away.\"A pause needs to be long enough for a breather, not long enough to get left behind.3 things in marketsAn economist said that undermining the independence of the Fed could shrink the American economy and cause capital to flow to other countries.Drew Angerer/Getty Images1. A timeline of Trump's beef with the Fed. Though Trump nominated Jerome Powell to his role in 2017, he's criticized the Fed chairman again and again over the years. Here are six times his ire has spilled into public view, including last week's outburst.2. Wall Street is more diverse than you think. The average banker didn't go to Harvard and is less likely to be white than you may expect — unless they're the boss. See BI's demographic breakdown of modern Wall Street.3. JPMorgan weighs in on Trump's trade war. The firm recently published new research saying it expects the US effective tariff rate to land between 10% and 20%, and that the US will narrowly avoid a recession. JPMorgan also had two recommendations for investors.3 things in techNvidia boss Jensen Huang sees clues in Marvel's Doctor Strage for advancing physical AI.PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images1. Inside Nvidia's hardcore culture. Nvidia is known for its demanding work culture. The key is that basically every single person is directly accountable to Jensen Huang, the CEO's biographer Stephen Witt told BI. Here's how Huang steers the company.2. The Cybertruck is coming to Saudi Arabia and Dubai. That's still a problem for Tesla. Taking the Cybertruck global is unlikely to do much to turn around Tesla's sales slump — or halt the \"brand crisis tornado\" that has turned some of the trucks into a target, BI's Tom Carter writes.3. AMD's plan to take on Nvidia. AMD has had to play catch-up in the data center arena since Nvidia has a 10-year head start. Now that the AI training workload is more focused on inference, however, it's eyeing an opportunity to bite into Nvidia's market share.3 things in businessRiyadh Air plans to fly Boeing 787s long-haul to major cities, including in the US.Taylor Rains/Business Insider1. Seat the rich. Saudi Arabia's new airline Riyadh Air plans to compete for first-class passengers. Its Business Elite tier suites have 32-inch TVs and seats that can be converted into double beds.2. A data startup working with Formula 1 raised $5 million to expand betting on niche and emerging sports. ALT Sports Data's CMO broke down the company's business pillars that it says drive fan engagement.3. Nightmare on Main Street. Trump imposed tariffs to encourage consumers to buy American.

The bank's $17.7 billion in quarterly revenue was boosted by a 45% increase in its equity trading business, whose revenue soared to a record $4.1 billion amid heightened market volatility.The bank also saw a jump in \"other\" revenue in its institutional securities group. That line includes the bank's corporate loan book, which benefited from the sale of loans the bank raised in 2022 to help Musk buy the social media platform now called X, according to a person with knowledge of the company's finances. Morgan Stanley led a group of seven banks in raising $13 billion in debt for the 2022 buyout. Bloomberg first reported that the boost in the \"other\" category was tied to the sale of the X loans.Morgan Stanley's 1Q earningsScreenshotMorgan Stanley has long been a banker to Musk. The firm's star tech banker, Michael Grimes, recently left Morgan Stanley after 30 years for a role with the Commerce Department, which is headed by Howard Lutnick, who also hails from Wall Street.Grimes played an important role in helping the Tesla CEO buy X, then called Twitter, in 2022. The deal ended up costing Morgan Stanley and the other lending banks billions in so-called hung loans, or debt that banks are having trouble offloading to investors. Morgan Stanley and other banks began selling the debt this year amid a brightened financial picture for X, according to a person with knowledge of the sales.On Friday, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the state of the economy, a stark contrast to comments made earlier on Friday by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\"We have not seen a slowdown,\" Pick said, referring to market activity since the start of April. \"Is it bumpier for some clients? Of course, it is,\" he said, adding, \"But we are still, we'll call it, cautiously optimistic that we won't go into recession, and we will just keep going.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Ted Pick, CEO of Morgan Stanley.Jeenah Moon/ReutersMorgan Stanley posted strong 1Q earnings on Friday, boosted by its equities trading business.Earnings also reflected the sale of loans tied to Elon Musk's purchase of X.The loans were on the company's books until recently, as Musk's star rose in relation to Trump.Morgan Stanley's long-time relationship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk is paying off.The investment bank on Friday posted net income of $4.3 billion in the first quarter, up 26% over last year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. The bank's $17.7 billion in quarterly revenue was boosted by a 45% increase in its equity trading business, whose revenue soared to a record $4.1 billion amid heightened market volatility.The bank also saw a jump in \"other\" revenue in its institutional securities group. That line includes the bank's corporate loan book, which benefited from the sale of loans the bank raised in 2022 to help Musk buy the social media platform now called X, according to a person with knowledge of the company's finances. Morgan Stanley led a group of seven banks in raising $13 billion in debt for the 2022 buyout. Bloomberg first reported that the boost in the \"other\" category was tied to the sale of the X loans.Morgan Stanley's 1Q earningsScreenshotMorgan Stanley has long been a banker to Musk. The firm's star tech banker, Michael Grimes, recently left Morgan Stanley after 30 years for a role with the Commerce Department, which is headed by Howard Lutnick, who also hails from Wall Street.Grimes played an important role in helping the Tesla CEO buy X, then called Twitter, in 2022.

Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock-traders delivered first-quarter revenue that exceeded analyst predictions, earning a record $4.13 billion from equities trading. The firm's wealth business saw higher-than-anticipated net new assets of $93.8 billion, and investment-banking fees rose 8% in the quarter. Wells Fargo (WFC) kept its expenses in check, beating forecasts. The bank left its full-year guidance unchanged, projecting net interest income growth of 1% to 3%, despite uncertainty around tariffs and their impact on the US economic outlook.

        "description": "Nvidia is one of the firms \"more protected\" from Trump's tariffs, Morgan Stanley said this week. Jensen Huang delivering the keynote address at Nvidia's annual GTC ConferenceJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNvidia might be able to easily weather Trump's trade war, Morgan Stanley said.The bank said it believed the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's business could be \"minimal.\"Demand for Nvidia's chips is strong, and the company could work its supply chain around duties, it said.Trump's escalation of his trade war has dragged down the market's highest-flying stocks— but there's good reason to think that Nvidia could ultimately be relatively unscathed in a trade war.That's according to Morgan Stanley, which called Nvidia its \"Top Pick\" in the market on Thursday, even as Trump doubled down on his tariff threats on China and caused the historic sell-off in stocks to accelerate.Semiconductors were left out of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. But tariffs on chips could potentially be on the table in the future, Morgan Stanley said — one thing that's clouding the outlook for mega-cap tech stocks, which have sold off heavily in the last week.Semiconductors were left out of Trump's April 2 tariff plan.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesBut, even if tariffs are implemented on chips, Nvidia looks like it could face \"fairly minimal\" consequences from those duties, in part because demand for its chips is so strong and because the firm has some flexibility with its supply chains, analysts at the bank said.\"NVIDIA remains our Top Pick with the undeniably positive GPU data points and an inference market clearly starved for GPUs across multiple hyperscalers. We think sustained AI spend and NVDA's relative supply chain flexibility will help them outperform, even in a higher tariff environment.\"Nvidia's chip hypeCEO Jensen Huang said that demand for Nvidia's Blackwell chip was \"insane.\"Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley said demand for Nvidia's chips is booming, largely due to the \"tight\" capacity for large language learning models to make new predictions and inferences. That's driving strong demand for Nvidia's products, even older-generation chip models like Hopper, it added.Nvidia reported record revenue of $39.2 billion over the last quarter, up 78% year-over-year.CEO Jensen Huang has also said that demand for Blackwell, Nvidia's latest chip, has been \"insane.\"\"Our industry contacts are generally unconcerned by the tariffs, because demand is strong, Blackwell is sold out, and demand is quite price insensitive,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts added.Supply chain alternativesMost builds for Nvidia's GB200 platform may be in North America and not subject to tariffs, Morgan Stanley said.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesMost of the framework for some of Nvidia's products may already be in North America. That means important components may not face tariffs at all, given the US's recent trade deal with Canada and Mexico.Morgan Stanley said it believed most of the builds for Nvidia's supercomputing platform, GB200, were likely already in North America. In a previous note, analysts pointed to how Hon Hai, one of Nvidia's partners, said it would boost its capacity for GB200 severs this year, which the bank said could be completed in a facility in Mexico.Bianca boards, one component of the GB200 platform, could also potentially be built in Mexico, given the recent \"significant ramp\" of capacity for the boards in the nation, analysts added.Other Nvidia partners, like ZT systems, could also potentially build GB200s in facilities in the US, the bank said.That's lowering tariff risk for Nvidia, though analysts noted that the stock could still be vulnerable in the event of a recession.\"That said, NVIDIA seems among the more protected companies, and will have minimal direct impact,\" the bank said of tariffs. \"But the type of recession also matters, as demand for GPUs remains resilient - and we would say risks to that come more from the financing side than from anywhere else,\" they later added.Nvidia shares have been hit harder than the overall market since Trump plowed ahead with his latest tariff plan in early April. Shares dropped as much as 14% in the first two trading days following Liberation Day, compared to the S&P 500, which dropped as much as 10% over that timeframe.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The stock market tumble could have more room to run as tariffs continue to wreak havoc, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said. A trader looks at screens as he works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New YorkReutersWatch 4,700 as the next level for support for the S&P 500, Morgan Stanley says.Valuations will be more attractive at this level, which is near the index's 200-week moving average.But Wall Street is also bracing for more pain, with forecasts as low as 4,450.With US indexes reeling from tariff pain, the market's descent might have a way to go before investors catch a lasting break.According to Morgan Stanley, the S&P 500's next support is at the 4,700 mark, or about 6% below the benchmark index's level on Monday around midday.The broad index has declined dramatically since President Donald Trump set off a global trade war last Wednesday, announcing a torrent of tariffs on US trading partners that were far beyond what markets expected. A broad cross-asset sell-off engulfed the market, dragging the S&P 500 to a bear market at Monday's intraday low.The 4,700 level is just above the index's 200-week moving average. Valuations will offer greater support at that level, as the market correction has pulled them down from pre-tariff highs.This is worth pointing out, as negative earnings revisions may be the main factor in the market rout, which tariffs have only exacerbated, the bank said.\"Many stocks have traded poorly all year even if the major indices held up until mid February. In most cases, the weakness was directly related to negative earnings revisions breadth, which had little to do with tariffs,\" analysts led by Mike Wilson wrote.Morgan StanleyStill, there's no guarantee that the 200-week average will hold in a recession scenario.\"Nevertheless, it's a good level to think about for a real support should markets decide to test the President's position on tariffs or the Fed's leaning toward its inflation mandate in the face of slowing growth and market disruption,\" Wilson wrote.Others are more certain about more stock pain to come.As Wilson noted, part of this will depend on whether the US falls into a tariff-induced recession, and chances of this happening have risen steeply.\"Historically, post the sharp VIX spikes, equities tended to be up 85% of the time, outside recessions,\" JPMorgan wrote in its own note, referring to a massive jump in the market's volatility gauge: \"Here, the last point is key, and we believe we will not be in the clear for a while yet.\"Peter Berezin, BCA Research chief global investment strategist, has long-maintained expectations for tariff chaos to slash the S&P 500 to 4,450 by year-end. He doubled down on this projection in a Friday interview with Bloomberg TV, though also noted that the forecast doesn't account for a recession.\"If anything, I might be too bullish,\" he said.Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg that the median drawdown for the S&P 500 in a recession is between 27% and 32%. With growth fears rising, RBC has lowered its target for the benchmark inddex to 5,550 from 6,200.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The risk of a recession is rising in Wall Street's view. Morgan Stanley's CIO says there are a few ways investors can navigate through a slowdown. Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIThe risk of recession is rising, according to Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist.The bank thinks the S&P 500 could drop below 5,500 in the event of a hard landing.Wilson outlined four investment themes to consider amid rising recession forecasts. Wall Street thinks the risk of a recession is growing, and according to Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist, there are a few moves investors can make to position for an economic slowdown. Mike Wilson, the chief investment officer at the bank, said he believes the risk of recession had gone up to around 30%-35%, up from 10%-20% at the start of the year. That's weighing on the outlook for stocks, he said, adding that the S&P 500 could drop below 5,500 in event of a hard landing.\"Once again, I think a majority of strategists and clients came into the year probably too bullish about kind of the trajectory,\" Wilson said speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday. The bank's base case though, is that the S&P 500 will rise to 6,500 over the next 12 months, which implies the benchmark index rising 14% from current levels.Talk of a potential recession has been growing louder on Wall Street. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs raised its probability of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%. Meanwhile, a March survey conducted by Bank of America found that 55% of fund managers said they saw a global recession triggered by trade war as the top risk to the market.Wilson said that the bank had been positioning for economic weakness over the last year, which is one reason Morgan Stanley's Focus List, a list of the bank's top investment ideas, has outperformed the S&P 500. The list has returned 7% year-to-date, compared to the benchmark index's 3% loss.\"We're just being more tactical, I think, than most people,\" he added. \"So we've been in the right sectors; we've been in the right tractors, for the most part, really for the last year.\"He highlighted several moves he and his team were making amid the current economy.1. Shift away from consumer goodsMorgan Stanley has shifted away from consumer goods stocks. That's due to underlying weakness in the economy, Wilson said, adding that he believed most of the \"private economy\" had already been in a recession for at least two years.He pointed to the drop in home sales and manufacturing activity, which first began to decline several years ago.\"We've been, you know, underweight consumer goods for literally three years and it's paid every year,\" he added.Concerns about consumer spending have been on the rise recently.Consumer confidence declined for the fourth straight month in March, with consumers' expectations for income, business activity, and the job market falling to the lowest level in 12 years, according to the Conference Board's latest survey.The Conference Board/NBERHousehold finances also look weaker, with fewer Americans able to cover emergency expenses than they were several years ago. According to the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed, 63% of US households said they had enough cash on hand to cover a surprise $2,000 bill, the lowest proportion recorded since 2015, according to an analysis from Apollo Global Management.2. Shift away from small capsFor similar reasons, Wilson's team has also shifted away from small-cap stocks.The Russell 2000 is down 7% so far this year.\"Small cap stocks, it's paid every year to be underweight these areas,\" Wilson said. \"So the market gets the joke. I just think a lot of stock observers haven't really understood what's been going on here. You know, the economy has not been strong. It has not been a balanced, good economy.\"3. Buy quality defensives and quality growth stocksMorgan Stanley's core portfolio is made up of high-quality companies in the defensive and growth sectors, Wilson said.That's because, in the current economic climate, companies don't have pricing power. That differs from several years ago when inflation accelerated and companies were able to raise prices to boost profits, he said.\"Today it's the exact opposite. Companies don't have pricing power, They can't really pass this on. So we've had a margin squeeze really in a lot of industries over the last couple of years, except for, if you're a monopoly,\" he added, pointing to large tech firms and other businesses that have been able to operate efficiently.\"So that market is still very much intact,\" Wilson said.4. Wait to purchase the weakest sectors and companiesInvestors should have their eye on the market's laggards — and be ready to jump on them when the economy officially enters a recession, Wilson said.\"If you have a true hard landing, the day that it becomes consensus, the first thing you want to do is buy the lowest quality stuff on the market,\" he said. You want to buy beaten up, you know, really levered companies, you know, bad balance sheet type businesses.\"He pointed to consumer goods, materials, and the energy sector in particular, all of which could benefit as the economy enters a \"rolling recovery\" and which need fresh economic growth to reset and move higher, he said.

        "description": "Earnings pessimism for The Magnificent Seven stocks look like it's approaching a bottom, and the group's revival could boost US stocks broadly. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BIThe sell-off in Magnificent Seven stocks may be over, according to Morgan Stanley.A rebound in the mega-cap tech group could put US markets back on top, the bank said in a note.Analysts pointed to positive signals like a weaker dollar and an improved earnings outlook.Things could be turning around for the mega-cap Magnificent Seven stocks, and a reversal of their recent downtrend bodes well for US stocks as a whole. The group of high-flying tech names — Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla — has had a brutal start to the year, with Meta the only member of the cohort to see a gain year-to-date. In a recent note, analysts at Morgan Stanley said they believe the group's outlook is improving. That also happens to be great news for the broader stock market, which has relied heavily on tech leadership to propel the bull market in the last two years. \"In our view, one of the reasons why we've seen capital rotate to international markets (Europe, in particular) is that the high quality leadership cohort of the US equity market began to underperform. Thus, if this group regains relative strength we could see a rotation back to the US,\" the bank added.Analysts led by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson said that strength in the Magnificent Seven group could draw investors back to US stocks after the latest correction. \"Stronger seasonals, lower rates, and oversold momentum indicators support our call for a tradable rally from ~5500,\" Wilson and other analysts wrote on Monday of their outlook for the S&P 500.\"Mag 7 earnings revisions look like they may be bottoming, which could also support a rotation back to the US,\" they later added.The bank, which said last week it believed the worst of the sell-off was over, pointed to recent declines in the US dollar, which has historically had a positive impact on US corporate earnings.The value of the greenback has trended lower over the past week as traders expect interest rates to drop in the US. The US Dollar Index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, traded around 104 on Monday, down around 5% from a peak of 109 in early January.A weaker currency makes US goods and services cheaper for other countries, which is positive for earnings.In the past, when the dollar has weakened against the euro, the ratio of S&P 500 to MSCI Europe earnings revision breadth has trended higher, a sign that corporate earnings in the US are strengthening relative to earnings in Europe.FactSet/Bloomberg/Morgan Stanley\"Relative underperformance of the US has been tied to weaker relative earnings revisions, which have partially been due to the lagged impact of a strong dollar in 4Q,\" Morgan Stanley said. \"This should offer a tailwind for US revisions and is one reason we think relative performance versus international developed equities can swing back in favor of the US in the near-to-intermediate term.\"The earnings outlook for the Magnificent Seven stocks already looks to be improving. Earnings revisions for the group of mega-cap tech names appear to be \"stabilizing\" and potentially approaching a bottom, the analysts said.FactSet/Morgan StanleyUS stocks saw the biggest weekly inflow so far in 2025 last week, with investors pouring a net $34.1 billion into US stocks, according to Bank of America data.Shares of the Magnificent Seven group, meanwhile, have started to perk up after their weekslong sell-off. The group has struggled so far in 2025 amid overarching concerns over US tariffs and China gaining momentum in the AI race.On Monday, some of the biggest losers in the group year to date rallied, with Tesla stock jumping nearly 10%, Nvidia up 4%, and Alphabet up 2%.

        "description": "It’s not just tech and media workers—and, of course, federal government employees—who are facing job cuts this year. Layoffs have come for Wall Street, too. Investment banking giant Morgan Stanley is about to lay off around 2,000 individuals, according to media reports. Here’s what you need to know. Thousands of job losses imminent Multiple reports over the past 24 hours have revealed Morgan Stanley’s alleged upcoming layoffs. The report of imminent job losses of as many as 2,000 workers first came from Bloomberg, which cited multiple sources with knowledge of the matter. Reuters then also reported on the news, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Besides agreeing on the figure of 2,000 job losses, both reports also state that the cuts will take place across the majority of Morgan Stanley’s 80,000-strong workforce. However, one group of workers is said to be spared any cuts: the company’s financial advisors, who make up about 15,000 workers at the investment firm. The 2,000 jobs are said to be being culled from the remaining 65,000-strong workforce. Morgan Stanley has not publicly announced any job cuts. Fast Company has reached out to the firm for comment. The cuts are being made about a year after Ted Pick became the company’s new CEO and a few months after Pick was also appointed as Morgan Stanley’s chairman. If the 2,000 figure is accurate, the cuts mean Morgan Stanley will eliminate approximately 2.5% of its workforce. According to Bloomberg, the cuts are being made to keep costs under control. Morgan Stanley is reportedly experiencing minimal attrition rates, which would normally help control workforce costs as people decide to leave voluntarily. Bloomberg says that those being laid off will be selected on many criteria, including performance, but some cuts will also be based on worker location. A small number of roles that can now be done with AI will also be eliminated. Wall Street cuts jobs amid Trump presidency It’s a common assumption that when a Republican is in office, the good times are about to roll on Wall Street. Indeed, when President Trump took office earlier this year, most industry watchers expected his second term to be a positive for Wall Street. However, since Trump took office, the stock markets have hammered due to several Trump-linked factors. The most notable is the president’s ongoing threat of tariffs against its closest and largest trading partners, including Mexico and Canada. Trump has also threatened most other countries in the world with the possibility of tariffs. Many economists fear that Trump’s tariff wars could lead to an all-out trade war, which would have negative implications for the global economy, not to mention small businesses. Trump has also supported the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal employees whose terminations have been recommended by the Elon Musk-affiliated Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While supporters say the cuts are necessary to eliminate government waste, adding tens of thousands of people to the unemployment lines will have knock-on ramifications for those people’s families, their ability to pay bills, and their local economies—all of which could lead to broader economic consequences. However, despite the Trump-fueled economic challenges the country is facing, a source told Reuters that the Morgan Stanley layoffs are not linked to the current conditions of the markets. Morgan Stanley isn’t the only Wall Street giant to lay off workers since Trump took office. As Reuters notes, Goldman Sachs says it will lay off 3% to 5% of its staff, and Bank of America has already laid off 150 workers in its investment banking arm. Morgan Stanley’s stock price is down for the year Despite the reports of imminent job cuts at Morgan Stanley, its stock has remained relatively flat since yesterday. Shares in the company (NYSE: MS) closed down 0.13% yesterday. In premarket trading today, as of the time of this writing, shares are up just half a percent. But at its closing price of $118.11 yesterday, Morgan Stanley shares are in the red for 2025. Since the beginning of the year, shares in the company have fallen around 6%. The company’s shares closed north of $137 the day after President Trump was sworn in. Still, longer-term investors have seen some decent gains from Morgan Stanley over the past year. In the past 12 months, MS shares are up over 34% as of yesterday’s close.",

        "description": "When you have a leading tech executive from OpenAI arrive at one of the most valuable global startups for a conference, you’re bound to be intrigued about what was said. The Morgan Stanley tech conference event was private, which meant no media or public access. But when you see Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI speak, you want to know more details of what went down. And that’s what we’re disclosing below thanks to analysts' discussions. Morgan Stanley has been busy working on AI for years to help revolutionize the business world and society. This might be one reason why Altman chose to go and speak in the first place. Altman began by shedding light on how AI is deflationary. He explained that this is one of the major impacts that such tech can have on the industry that keeps getting underappreciated and misunderstood. That has a lot to do with the fact that there’s great potential for worldwide efficiency and more productivity that could offset inflation.The cost to get access to AI and make the most of AI tools is reducing. This has a lot to do with newer and more advanced techniques that make AI model production a simpler process. There is a lot of competition and variety in the industry. \"Inference and reasoning were growing faster than pre-learning and learning workloads. All acknowledged that the price of inference is falling, Sam Altman mentioned by 16X of the prior year - this is a good thing.\", explained Mark P. McDonald, Distinguished Vice President and Research Fellow at Gartner.So many models mean the laws of supply and demand work well here. They’re becoming a huge commodity and lower in terms of pricing. This is wonderful news for people needing greater access to such models as they’re paying a lot than what they did in the past.The company shared how there are serious capacity constraints at OpenAI that GPUs remain saturated. It has never gone through a phase where it cannot sell access to GPUs at a reasonable price tag.At high levels, the comments are consistent with thematic frameworks where small companies focus more on training the large language models that require major computing. This comes at a time when experts discussed how many debates there are about the strength of GPU demand and how that could affect our future. Now OpenAI is not concerned about matters like training data or data supply for training models. The fact that the AI giant can utilize its GPUs and other AI models to produce more data puts it at ease. This process is dubbed synthetic data and is slowly becoming more useful for certain stages of this entire mode creation endeavor. Data shouldn’t be deemed a constraint like the way computing has transformed into a restraint as per analysts at Morgan Stanley. Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Game-Changer or Gimmick?

The event was closed to the public and the media, so details have been thin about what was discussed. Until now.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts published a roundup of comments from the event, including some of what Altman and OpenAI discussed.This company is one of the world's most valuable startups, working on AI technology that could revolutionize business and broader society. And Altman is probably the second most famous tech executive in the world, behind Elon Musk.This makes it pretty important to check up on Altman's thinking regularly — especially when he shares thoughts in a semi-private setting.Here are some highlights from the event, according to Morgan Stanley analysts:AI = deflation?Altman spoke about how AI could be deflationary.

The event was closed to the public and the media, so details have been thin about what was discussed. Until now.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts published a roundup of comments from the event, including some of what Altman and OpenAI discussed.This company is one of the world's most valuable startups, working on AI technology that could revolutionize business and broader society. And Altman is probably the second most famous tech executive in the world, behind Elon Musk.This makes it pretty important to check up on Altman's thinking regularly — especially when he shares thoughts in a semi-private setting.Here are some highlights from the event, according to Morgan Stanley analysts:AI = deflation?Altman spoke about how AI could be deflationary.

        "description": "Morgan Stanley has been one of the most bearish firms on Wall Street, and it's been proven right lately. Getty Images / Spencer PlattInvestors can expect S&P 500 support at the 5,500 level, Morgan Stanley said.That's about 3% below Monday levels.Stocks have been mired in a sharp sell-off that's seen the S&P 500 fall 8% since mid-February.With the S&P 500 now down 8% from recent highs, Morgan Stanley is eyeing when investors could get some relief from selling.The firm says the 5,500 level, about 3% below current levels, represents support for the benchmark index.It's a threshold that's rapidly approaching as US indexes get whacked by a combination of tariff-driven recession fears and AI-trade exhaustion. From off its worst week in six months, the S&P 500 fell as much as 2%. The Nasdaq Composite — already in a correction — fared even worse, dropping 3%.Morgan Stanley cites tariff uncertainty, fiscal-policy drags, and a strong dollar as the main culprits driving the market slump, and says it largely expected the outcome.\"Price action supports our long-standing view that policy would likely be sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before lower deficits/rates and less crowding out of the private economy benefit the market later in the year,\" wrote a team of analysts led by chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson.Washington's on-and-off tariff threat has been leading concern among investors, spiking fears of higher inflation and a mounting recession. Immigration enforcement and the budget-cutting actions of the Department of Government Efficiency are also growth-negative pressure on earnings, the bank noted.For those in the market, this has meant piling into risk-off assets. Bonds and gold have gained.The 5,500 level would not be the end of the road. A combination of tailwinds suggests that the index should expect support at around the threshold, which could come later this month.Positives include a shifting economic surprise index, which could start to turn higher in a matter of weeks. The bank also cited a slipping dollar, and the fact that earnings revisions and equity performance will seasonally improve in March.Morgan Stanley still expects the benchmark to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025, though it warned that the path to that goal will remain choppy.\"In the bear case where growth falls off more significantly and recession becomes likely, the S&P 500 is likely to trade toward our bear case target of 4,600. We are not there, but things can change quickly and so it's useful to know the downside in the bear case to manage one's risk,\" Wilson wrote.Read the original article on Business Insider",

President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is back in full force — for now, at least.Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley listed stocks resilient to tariffs in a client note Monday.Investors are worried about how Trump's trade war could impact inflation, rates, and earnings.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hints at possible tariff reductions, but details remain unclear.One way to keep tariffs from sinking your stock portfolio? Invest in companies with products so good that they can raise their prices at will.That's the thinking behind a list of stocks Morgan Stanley published in a client note on Monday.The bank's top equity strategist, Mike Wilson, had his team of analysts put together a list of companies that they think are most protected from tariffs compared to other firms in their respective industries, perhaps because they can pass along the higher import costs to consumers.The note came amid news that President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is back in full force — for now, at least.Stocks fell on Tuesday on the news as investors worried about the ramifications for inflation, interest rates, and corporate earnings.While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted that the 25% tariffs imposed on America's two neighbors and the 20% import fees on Chinese goods could be reduced soon, it remains unclear to what degree they could come down and for how long. New tariffs on goods from European Union countries are also expected at some point.Below are the 18 stocks on the list that Morgan Stanley also has an \"Overweight\" rating on, meaning the bank thinks investors might do well to hold the stock in their portfolios above its weight in the S&P 500.
