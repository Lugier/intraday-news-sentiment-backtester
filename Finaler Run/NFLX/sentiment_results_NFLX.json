While \"Love Is Blind\" is mentioned as one of Netflix's most popular unscripted shows, the granular details of the couples' relationships are unlikely to have a significant, immediate impact on NFLX's stock price within the next 60 minutes, as it does not directly affect revenue, costs, operations or market share.\n```"
