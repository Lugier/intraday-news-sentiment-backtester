        "description": "Robin Wright revealed the deal she had to make with Netflix to get equal pay to her costar Kevin Spacey on \"House of Cards.\" Robin Wright.Valery Hache/AFP/GettyRobin Wright said she fought for equal pay with Kevin Spacey on Netflix's \"House of Cards.\"Wright said she got an executive producer credit and directed episodes to make the same amount as Spacey.She said she was told she wouldn't be paid as much as Spacey because she hadn't won an Oscar.When it came to getting paid the same amount as her \"House of Cards\" costar Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright had to be as shrewd as her character Claire Underwood.While speaking at the Monte-Carlo TV Festival on Monday, Wright opened up about fighting for equal pay with Spacey going into the fourth season of the hit Netflix series.\"It was difficult, I am going to be honest,\" she said, according to Variety. \"When I said, 'I think it's only fair because my character became as popular as [Spacey's],' they said, 'We can't pay you the same as an actor, so we will make you exec producer and you can direct. We will give you three different paychecks.' I asked, 'Why can't you pay me as an actor?' 'Because you didn't win an Academy Award.'\"Robin Wright played Claire Underwood on the Netflix series \"House of Cards.\"NetflixWhen the landmark Netflix series about amoral politician Frank Underwood (Spacey) and his ambitious wife Claire (Wright) debuted in 2013, Spacey was an established star who had already won two Oscars: best supporting actor for 1995's \"The Usual Suspects\" and best actor for 1999's \"American Beauty.\" A year later in 2014, he was reportedly earning $500,000 an episode for the series' second season.By the time \"House of Cards\" ended its six-season run in 2018, Wright's Claire had become the series' lead after Spacey was fired in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.So, did Wright ever get equal pay?\"I don't think I'm getting paid the same amount,\" Wright revealed in a 2017 profile for the United Airlines in-flight magazine Rhapsody. \"They told me I was getting a raise. But... I don't think so.\"Looking back on it now, Wright said being angry over unequal pay wouldn't have made a difference because it \"wasn't going to change anything.\"\"That has been the protocol for years — it just is,\" Wright said at the Monte-Carlo TV Festival. \"If you say, 'Why did so-and-so female not get the same amount as Will Smith?' They say, 'It will increase after you win.' Nomination, not so much. Why does it have to do anything with a raise?\"Netflix did not respond for to a request for comment.Wright went on to direct 10 episodes of \"House of Cards\" and was an executive producer on seasons four through six.She will star, direct episodes, and executive produce the upcoming limited series \"The Girlfriend,\" which will be released on Prime Video in the fall.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The first episode runs about 20 minutes and resembles a low-budget comedy you might have once seen on Comedy Central.But it's not on cable. It's on YouTube.Welcome to 2025, when the big question in Hollywood isn't whether YouTube can work in the living room, but rather, how much of the entertainment landscape can it conquer.\"Shanked\" isn't the only scripted show on YouTube, with top creators like Dhar Mann and Alan Chikin Chow making TV-like series for the platform.Meanwhile, streamers like Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video are also updating their strategies, both by taking cues from cable TV — with ads and costly live sports — and seeing how they can mine social media for creator talent.For the creators of \"Shanked,\" YouTube was a no-brainer. Ryan Horrigan of production company London Alley said he saw a lack of low-budget comedies on TV at the same time YouTube was increasingly favoring 20-minute episodic series. Why not a comedy, he thought.James Lynch, a comedian who co-created and stars in the show, said he felt the lines between entertainment platforms were increasingly blurring.\"We love shows like 'Severance,' but every time I go to a friend's house, there's always something on YouTube,\" he said.Google-owned YouTube has nurtured a creator economy that Goldman Sachs estimated would grow to about $480 billion by 2027. Many in the entertainment and advertising world dismissed YouTube as a repository for amateur videos and movie trailers until it became the No. 1 viewed platform on TVs, per Nielsen, ahead of the \"real TV\" companies Netflix, Disney, and Prime Video.As YouTube and TV begin to converge, it looks like the Hollywood system as we know it will never be the same. But how the ecosystem will look when the dust settles is much more difficult to parse.YouTube is encouraging episodic seriesLately, YouTube has been rolling out tools and features to encourage creators to make shows for the living room. It's also doing more to match advertisers to creators to support the kinds of shows you're used to seeing on TV.At Brandcast, YouTube's big annual presentation to the advertising community, it underlined the point by showing off top creators like IShowSpeed and Michelle Khare, who are making episodic series. And it's making a big push to win an Emmy to prove it can support quality TV.Viewership is one thing, but advertising, the lifeblood of entertainment, is another. Many major brands still want to be associated with buzzy scripted shows and movies that drive the mainstream conversation, like \"The White Lotus,\" and most creators aren't close to that yet. Only a handful, like MrBeast and Dude Perfect, are making Hollywood-style productions. AI tools could reduce that friction, though, by cutting time and costs from video production.\"Creator content is dominating TV watch time — not just on phones, but on the biggest screens in the house, replacing what used to be traditional television. Yet brands are still spending like it's 2015, chasing impressions over impact,\" said Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, a media measurement company.Advertisers are closing the gap, though.Ad holding company giant WPP recently estimated that creators would earn $185 billion between direct brand deals and platform revenue share, surpassing ad spending on TV companies like Disney and Paramount.Top ad spender Unilever also said it would move to spend 50% of its advertising on social media platforms, up from about 30%, and work with 20 times more influencers.Amazon is betting big on YouTuber MrBeast.AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesCan Hollywood adapt?YouTube's growth could be a problem for Hollywood, which is built on direct ownership of IP and entertainment that moves the culture but costs a ton.Studios and streamers aren't spending like they were when everyone was trying to catch Netflix, but they still need new stuff to keep viewers coming back and capture younger audiences. Creator-led shows offer one way forward.But can they pull it off? There are promising signs.Amazon is the most prominent example of a company betting huge on a creator. It spent more than $100 million to make MrBeast's \"Beast Games,\" which became its most-watched unscripted show, and just renewed it for two more seasons.Netflix has done deals with The Sidemen, kids' educator Ms. Rachel, and more. Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max has a new reality show starring Jake Paul and his brother, Logan, \"Paul American.\" And Disney's Hulu has a hit in \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.\"Entertainment companies have gotten more sophisticated about how they work with creators. They're tapping them for their ideas rather than simply looking for a piece of their audience, in contrast with some past flopped creator experiments. Netflix is looking at YouTubers as producers as well as on-screen talent, an unscripted agent told Business Insider. NBCUniversal's Peacock just announced a slate of shows developed by creators via an accelerator program. Tubi has an initiative called Stubios to nurture up-and-coming filmmakers.Media and entertainment companies are also looking at other forms of low-cost content, like soapy mini-dramas and video podcasts.There are challenges, however.Creators like YouTube because there's no gatekeeper. It gives them a lot of data, lets them own their content, and gives them a relatively generous 55% cut of the ad revenue.Creator talent reps told BI some of their clients had walked away from potential Netflix deals because the streamer wouldn't budge from the Hollywood playbook, in which it owns ancillary rights to things like e-commerce revenue.Scott Purdy, a media consultant at KPMG, said entertainment companies would likely start to look at YouTube and other social platforms as potential places to actually launch shows, starting with low-budget fare.\"For most companies, most options are on the table,\" he said.Meanwhile, producers like Horrigan are blue-skying other creator-led formats to put on YouTube.\"Talent is still going to want to play in both sandboxes, but we're moving up the stack,\" he said. \"What's next — is horror going to be a thing on YouTube, teen romance? I think that's going to be a thing as well.\"Read the original article on Business Insider From left: Sean Evans, Dhar Mann, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, and IShowSpeed.Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for YouTubeYouTube is now a major player in TV, surpassing platforms like Netflix in viewership.YouTubers are starting to develop scripted shows, and the platform is shedding advertiser stigma.Hollywood is also adapting to the new media ecosystem and working with influencers.A new golf comedy called \"Shanked,\" which follows the hijinks at a country club where employees clash with pampered members, made its debut this month.

Media buyers attending Digiday’s Programmatic Marketing Summit last month expressed a desire to evaluate their DSP partnerships and explore opportunities to shift more spend to more favorable, i.e., transparent, platforms that better align with client needs.

        "description": "Stockton Rush in the Titan submarine, as seen in Netflix's \"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster.\"Balazs Gardi/Courtesy of Netflix'Titan: The OceanGate Disaster' examines the 2023 submarine accident that killed five people.OceanGate's former chief pilot said Stockton Rush crashed into a shipwreck in 2016.David Lochridge said he was cut from the project for voicing his concerns.The former chief pilot of OceanGate said the company's CEO ignored his warnings that the Titan submersible — which was destroyed in a deadly implosion — was unsafe.David Lochridge made the claim in Netflix's new documentary, \"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster.\" It examines what went wrong in the run-up to the Titan's visit to the wreck of the Titanic, which ended in the CEO of OceanGate, Stockton Rush, and four others dying onboard.Lochridge recalled just how determined Rush was to achieve his goal of making deep-sea tourism a reality.The documentary features archival footage of Rush and his team building submersibles, including the Titan. In one clip taken from an interview with CBS, Rush says: \"By the time we're done testing it, I believe it's pretty much invulnerable.\"Lochridge was OceanGate's director of marine operations and the company's chief pilot from 2015 to 2018. He recalled how in 2016, Rush chartered a dive with the Titan's predecessor, the Cyclops 1 submarine, to see the SS Andrea Doria wreck off the coast of Massachusetts.

Lochridge said that after the crew resurfaced, Rush's attitude toward him changed.\"The passengers were hugging, but with Stockton, it was a complete turnaround for me.

You could actually see the porosity, you could see the delaminations, you could see all the voids,\" he continued, referring to the separation of layers.Nissen also appears in the documentary and said he was pressured by Rush to \"make sure nobody spoke up.\"Footage from 2018 also shows Rush arguing with Lochridge as he believed that the submarine could handle pressure at the extreme depths.\"What you do is you set a testing program where you do it incrementally. It's not just going to go to 3100 [metres] and be perfect, and at 3200 [metres] it all goes anyway. That ain't going to happen, and I will put my life on the line to say that ain't going to happen,\" he said.OceanGate ceased operations in July 2023 and could not be reached for comment.\"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster\" is streaming on Netflix.Read the original article on Business Insider Stockton Rush in the Titan submarine, as seen in Netflix's \"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster.\"Balazs Gardi/Courtesy of Netflix'Titan: The OceanGate Disaster' examines the 2023 submarine accident that killed five people.OceanGate's former chief pilot said Stockton Rush crashed into a shipwreck in 2016.David Lochridge said he was cut from the project for voicing his concerns.The former chief pilot of OceanGate said the company's CEO ignored his warnings that the Titan submersible — which was destroyed in a deadly implosion — was unsafe.David Lochridge made the claim in Netflix's new documentary, \"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster.\" It examines what went wrong in the run-up to the Titan's visit to the wreck of the Titanic, which ended in the CEO of OceanGate, Stockton Rush, and four others dying onboard.Lochridge recalled just how determined Rush was to achieve his goal of making deep-sea tourism a reality.The documentary features archival footage of Rush and his team building submersibles, including the Titan. In one clip taken from an interview with CBS, Rush says: \"By the time we're done testing it, I believe it's pretty much invulnerable.\"Lochridge was OceanGate's director of marine operations and the company's chief pilot from 2015 to 2018. He recalled how in 2016, Rush chartered a dive with the Titan's predecessor, the Cyclops 1 submarine, to see the SS Andrea Doria wreck off the coast of Massachusetts. The ship sank in 1956 after colliding with the SS Stockholm due to heavy fog.Lochridge said he had to persuade Stockton to let him accompany him on the voyage, which included paying passengers, after he decided to pilot it himself.Footage from inside the Cyclops during the dive, featured in the documentary, shows Rush piloting the submarine into a debris field underneath the bow of the Andrea Doria.

        "description": "Scott Frank's \"Dept. Q\" is a take on the British crime show that has found viewers around the world.Justin Downing/NetflixScott Frank wrote lots of big, successful movies.Now he makes successful shows for Netflix, like \"The Queen's Gambit\" and, now, \"Dept. Q\"Frank says it's getting more difficult to command audiences' attention. Which is why he's fascinated by video games, which force you to focus on a single thing.Scott Frank figured out how to thrive in Hollywood. Now he's doing it at Netflix.But the writer/director has advice for young people who want to follow in his footsteps: Try something else.If Frank were starting out his career in 2025, he said he wouldn't mess around with movies or television. \"I'd want to go work in the gaming world, where I think there's some really interesting stuff going on,\" he told me this month.That's quite a comment coming from someone who spent years as one of the most in-demand writers in the movie business, and has now established himself as a reliable hitmaker for Netflix. \"Dept. Q\" — his third series for the streamer, following his \"Godless\" western and the pandemic megahit \"The Queen's Gambit\" — is his take on the British mystery genre, and it's been near the top of the Netflix charts since it debuted in May.But Frank says the wave of digital distractions and options makes it incredibly difficult for traditional movies and TV to capture audience attention today. For all of Netflix's massive success, it still lags behind YouTube in terms of time viewers spend on screens, he notes. And teens are now spending an astonishing two hours a day on TikTok.\"So, how do you get people to go to the movies? How do you get people to pay attention to your show? There's so much stuff,\" he tells me.\"Whereas gaming — you're not folding your laundry while you're playing a game. You're not texting while you're playing a game. You're involved. And that seems to me like an opportunity for storytelling.\"That won't be an opportunity for Frank himself — \"I'm too old,\" he says — and he says he'll continue to try making movies and TV shows. He'd love to make a second season of \"Dept. Q,\" which is based on a series of crime novels by Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen.You can hear my full conversation with Frank on my Channels podcast. The following is an edited excerpt from our chat:Scott Frank, who's behind Netflix's \"Dept. Q,\" says he'd now work in video games if he were starting all over as a young person.Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Writers Guild of America EastPeter Kafka: Some Netflix shows and movies seem like they'll generate huge numbers, but don't feel like they have cultural resonance. But it seems like people are talking about your show. Do you feel that?Scott Frank: You're certainly correct in that a lot of the movies, in particular, don't leave much of a ripple. There's not a lot of cultural wake.That being said, they are watched a lot, and people enjoy watching them and seek them out. And Netflix has 300 million worldwide subscribers, so way more people are going to watch your movie. As opposed to something getting released in theaters that no one watches, and it doesn't create any kind of long tail, either.With the television shows, it's a little different. Because when they hit, they tend to leave a mark. They tend to resonate.What accounts for that? Is it simply because there's more of it? There's 10 episodes, so you're spending more time? And there's more reason to talk about it, because it's episodic — you can tell people, \"Wait till you get to episode five?\"Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I think that's why. It's a different sort of investment. When you're sitting down to watch a show, you are hoping that it's something you're going to stick with. Whereas when you're watching a movie, you know: \"I have a couple hours, an hour and a half, I'm gonna watch this thing.\"I don't have an easy answer other than to say that, for me, the engagement and narrative in the world right now have never been higher.During the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes a couple of years ago, AI didn't start off as the big issue, but then became one, or at least the dominant talking point. What did you make of that discussion then? And how are you thinking about AI and tech now?Tech has been a bit of a disaster for the country in many ways, but it's also been an amazing boon to the world. I just think that these guys run the companies, so many of them are compromised and …Let's narrow it down to your world. We could have the other discussion …But I think it affects my world because they now own my world. We probably were striking against the wrong people that time. Because we're owned by tech people now. This is increasingly more and more a tech business. And so, ultimately, we're at the whim of these people at the very top of these companies.We saw after, after the election, everybody's sort of paying, essentially bribes to [Donald Trump]. So that affects us. That really does affect the business. People are afraid now. And so you see that. You see people are too careful.They're afraid because of the political climate, or they're afraid just because it's an era of consolidation and there just aren't that many places to go if you upset a studio chief?I think all of the above. I just think it's all at the same time. Also, the ground is shifting. This business hasn't landed where it's going to land yet, and people keep looking backwards and saying, \"No, we just need to get moviegoing back to where it was.\" That boat's sailed. That's not gonna happen anymore.So we're not thinking about, \"Well, what is the business now? What does the business want to be?\" The audience is trying to tell us, and we're not listening.How do you feel about using tech and AI in your work? There's one theory that says someone's going to type in a prompt and the AI spits out an entire movie. The more conservative argument is, \"We're going to improve flows, and instead of using 10 visual-effects people, you could do it with four or eight.\" The even more positive spin is, \"Those eight to 10 visual-effects people could do much better work.\"We've always used versions of that. If it wasn't proper AI, there were always ways to shortcut those kinds of things, to create a smoother workflow and all of that. If an actor couldn't do a certain stunt, and we wanted to put their face on something else, that's been happening, and that's going to get easier. Which is scary if you're an actor.I think the bigger problem is not making stuff with AI, but deciding what to make with AI. That's the bigger threat, at least for me, in the immediate sense.Have you played around and asked ChatGPT to write a script in the mode of Scott Frank?Yeah. It was silly.But if you want to write a letter, a business letter or something … my wife needed to write this letter, and she just thought, \"Let's see what ChatGPT said,\" and she sent me the letter and it was damn good. It was really good.I think it's more about the future of the algorithm. The algorithm is great for marketing after something's done.[But] it's death to the industry to use it to decide what to make because you're gaming something. And if everybody's using the same algorithm, it becomes a snake that eats its own tail eventually. That's my big fear.You started in Hollywood the old-fashioned way — you moved there and spent years trying to get work as a writer.I wrote one script over and over that no one wanted — \"Little Man Tate\" — until somebody wanted it.What would that path look like for you now if you wanted to get into making movies or television? Would you move to LA, for starters?That's easy. I wouldn't go into movies or television. I'd go into games.If I were 24 now, I'm not gonna fuck around with movies or television. I want to go work in the gaming world, where I think there's some really interesting stuff going on.Other than the fact that lots of people play games, what's appealing to you? They seem pretty narratively limited.But they're at the beginning, in a way. I mean, the first movies were narratively limited, too.And I wonder what you can do with them. I'm really curious. I just feel like that world is way more interesting.You know, more people watch YouTube stuff and TikTok stuff than Netflix. YouTube is No. 1 [for time spent] and Netflix is way down [the list]. And then the next closest thing, Disney, is way down. And people on average spend two hours a day on TikTok.So that's what you're competing with.So your next project is an immersive game …No. I'm too old.There's a series of \"Dept. Q\" books. Will you do more of them?I'd love to. It's up to Netflix. I would absolutely love to.Read the original article on Business Insider Scott Frank's \"Dept.

        "description": "Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein in Guillermo Del Toro's \"Frankenstein.\"NetflixNetflix's \"Frankenstein\" movie features Oscar Isaac as the titular mad scientist.\"Saltburn\" and \"Euphoria\" star Jacob Elordi plays Frankenstein's monster.Here's what we know so far about the film directed by the Oscar-winning director, Guillermo del Toro.Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is coming to Netflix this fall, with Oscar Isaac playing Victor Frankenstein, the mad scientist who builds a monster (Jacob Elordi) using dead people's body parts.Based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \"Frankenstein,\" the synopsis for the film reads: \"A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.\"Netflix released the first \"Frankenstein\" trailer at its annual \"Tudum\" event on May 31, giving subscribers a glimpse of del Toro's gothic vision for the story. Here's what to know about the film.The first 'Frankenstein' trailer shows off Guillermo del Toro's faithful adaptation of the bookThe first trailer establishes how Frankenstein is obsessed with the idea of building a creature. In the ominous voiceover, he says: \"I had a vision, an idea took shape in my mind. Inevitable, unavoidable, until it became truth.\"It shows his sprawling laboratory and the device he hooks up to a lightning rod on the building's spire to give life to his monster.

Here's what to know about the film.The first 'Frankenstein' trailer shows off Guillermo del Toro's faithful adaptation of the bookThe first trailer establishes how Frankenstein is obsessed with the idea of building a creature. In the ominous voiceover, he says: \"I had a vision, an idea took shape in my mind. Inevitable, unavoidable, until it became truth.\"It shows his sprawling laboratory and the device he hooks up to a lightning rod on the building's spire to give life to his monster. Unlike previous adaptations of Shelley's book, del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" appears to be faithful to the source material. Most other adaptations do not feature Frankenstein chasing the monster into the Arctic toward the end of the plot.

        "description": "The fifth and final season of Netflix’s Stranger Things is dropping on Netflix just in time for Thanksgiving. And Christmas. And also New Year’s Eve. The industry-leading streaming service, whose stock reached a record high on Monday after the weekend’s successful Tudum 2025 event, just announced that the conclusion to its monster hit series will arrive in three batches. The first four episodes are set to debut on November 26 (the day before Thanksgiving) at 8pm ET, the following three air on Christmas Day at the same time, and the final episode will come out on New Year’s Eve, also at 8pm ET. It’s an innovative, carefully calibrated twist on the staggered streaming release schedule, although some fans seem to find Netflix’s upcoming stranglehold on holiday viewing as diabolical as a demogorgon. Streaming services can go any number of ways these days when putting out a new season of a beloved show. As they assess the right drop pattern, executives tend to consider target audience, episode length, and total number of episodes, alongside other less tangible factors such as whether the show has a 10-hour movie-style continuous story, lending itself more to the binge model, or an intense character-study vibe, which smolders as its doled out. Netflix has been breaking up hits like Bridgerton into two batched binges for years, while Hulu sticks with full-binge for The Bear, Prime Video offers three episodes to kick off The Boys before slowing down with weekly episodes, and Max’s Hacks sometimes airs an episode or two per week with seemingly no rhyme or reason. If it could be said that there are any rules to how a streamer releases a hot show, these services are rewriting and codifying them in real time. When Netflix released the most recent season of Stranger Things three summers ago, it set out to monopolize two close-together holidays: Memorial Day and July 4th. The first volume of the fourth season arrived on May 27, 2022, with seven episodes, and then concluded on July 1, with two more. It proved a successful scheduling gambit. All told, the season racked up a seismic 1.352 billion hours of viewing in its first 28 days, ranking as Netflix’s most-watched English-language series, and second overall after the first season of Squid Game. Even more impressive, the fourth season of Stranger Things had no small part in helping the company add 2.41 million subscribers in Q3 2022, when it dropped. Netflix’s approach to scheduling the final season of Stranger Things takes that blatant holiday-ownership approach a step further, though. By stretching out the season across three major end-of-year holidays–during which families are frequently hunkered down together, hunting for crowd-pleasing popcorn fare–Netflix is capitalizing on its captive audience. As if to underscore the point, the service is bumping up its usual 3am ET drop time for new releases to what is known in terrestrial TV world as “prime time,” at 8pm ET, when families are more likely to fill up couches together. It’s an ingenuous tactic for driving up end-of-year subscriptions, one that will almost certainly end up breaking viewership records. But it also feels rather brazen in its attempt to conquer all family holidays with a gargantuan four-quadrant hit. When Netflix offered a holiday release for the second season of Squid Game last year, for instance, the service waited until the day after Christmas—perhaps out of respect for the sanctity of the holiday, or in fear of being crowded out by too many Home Alone, Elf and National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation viewings—and dropped the entire season all at once. This year, Netflix is owning its ambition to dominate the holidays. (To that end, it’s also building on last year’s Christmas Day NFL games, which collectively attracted 65 million U.S. viewers, a record for most-streamed NFL games ever, with two more Christmas Day games.) The service clearly has faith that the draw of Stranger Things wrapping up is enough to put A Muppet Christmas Carol and its ilk on the backburner for one year. Plenty of Stranger Things fans are only too happy to have their family time supplemented by the suburban, supernatural hijinks of the world’s most twentysomething teens. “Guess I’m spending the holidays in Hawkins this year,” a typical commenter replied to Netflix’s tweet announcing the release dates. (“And we’re happy to have ya nerd,” Netflix wrote back.) Not all fans were as excited, though, about the way the final season is being teased out. Some of them complained about Netflix breaking up the conclusion they’ve been waiting three years for into three chunks, prolonging their anticipation. Others seem more opposed to the idea of Netflix encroaching on so much family time with an offer Stranger Things fans can’t refuse—the TV equivalent of bumping up Black Friday deals to Thursday around dinner time. All of them will likely tune in to watch, though, along with a billion or two fellow subscribers. If the grand finale succeeds at the level Netflix expects it to, perhaps the end of Stranger Things will spell the beginning of a new arms race for holiday streaming content, launching in 2026.",

Simone's life among the upper class is disrupted by the arrival of her older sister, Devon (Meghann Fahy), who treks from Buffalo to the town in order to reconnect with Simone and get help taking care of their ailing dad, Bruce (Bill Camp).The five-episode series is adapted from Molly Smith Metzler's play Elemeno Pea, which she wrote while attending the Juilliard School. She serves as the showrunner.During its premiere week, \"Sirens\" debuted in the No. 1 spot on Netflix's English TV list and amassed 16.7 million views in four days.Although \"Sirens\" ends by tying up the main characters' storylines, some questions remain, leaving fans wondering if this is the last they've seen of everyone.Here's what happens to every major character, and a rundown of whether \"Sirens\" could be back for season two.The 'Sirens' ending swaps the fates of Simone and MichaelaMilly Alcock as Simone and Julianne Moore as Michaela in \"Sirens.\"NetflixAt the end of episode four, after Simone rejects his proposal, a drunken Ethan (Glenn Howerton) calls her a monster, blames her for his problems, and trips and falls from the estate's cliff. Ethan doesn't die, though. In the finale, he wakes up in the hospital high on meds with both his legs, an arm, and a couple of ribs broken, though he's expected to make a full recovery.Michaela then fires Simone after learning that her husband, Peter (Kevin Bacon), and Simone kissed. Even though it was a momentary lapse in judgment from Peter that Simone didn't instigate, Michaela feels that Simone can't be trusted anymore and has become a threat to her marriage.Devon chooses to return to Buffalo with her dad to continue being his caretaker, rather than spend a month on a yacht with Morgan (Trevor Salter), one of the locals she hooked up with. But Simone refuses to join them, because she's unable to forgive her dad for neglecting her as a child, since his actions led to her ending up in foster care.Simone runs back to the Cliff House with no plan, just desperate not to return to Buffalo. In doing so, she bumps into Peter, who proclaims his love for her.Mid-gala, Peter ends his 13-year marriage to Michaela and starts a relationship with Simone, who he believes will bring \"love and light\" into his life (and maybe even another child).Simone then morphs into Michaela 2.0, adopting her cultlike mannerisms and embracing her new position of power at the estate. She and Devon have an emotional goodbye, knowing that they're embarking on completely different paths.On the ferry ride out of Port Haven, Devon runs into Michaela, who's been ousted from Cliff House and has no idea where she's headed.Devon apologizes for accusing Michaela of being a murderer and a cult leader, and Michaela accepts her apology and encourages Devon to cash the $10,000 check she gave her at the start of the series so she can fund a better life for herself in Buffalo.The series concludes with Simone, wearing an elegant light-blue gown that Michaela got her for the gala, standing at the cliff, staring at the vista during sunset with the hint of a smile.Will 'Sirens' return for season two?Milly Alcock as Simone in \"Sirens.\"NetflixThe short answer: probably not.\"Sirens\" is categorized and promoted as a Netflix limited series. That said, a second season isn't entirely unlikely.\"Adolescence\" skyrocketed in popularity since its debut in March and is currently Netflix's third most-watched English-language show of all time, behind season one of \"Wednesday\" and season four of \"Stranger Things.\" Although it was labeled as a limited series, Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, is reportedly interested in some form of a second season of \"Adolescence\" after the first season's success.Considering how well \"Sirens\" has performed on the streamer since its release, it wouldn't be surprising if the series didn't end up being limited after all. But for now, Netflix hasn't announced any further plans.Fahy told Variety that the show reaches a natural conclusion, but she could imagine a continuation.\"I, for one, would love to know what happens to Michaela, where she goes,\" she said. \"So I think it's definitely within the realm of possibility. We didn't talk about it on set, but I would love to do more.\"Metzler, for her part, told Glamour that questions about a second season mean that fans are invested in the characters.\"I wrote the play 15 years ago,\" she said. \"I've been thinking about them this whole time. I could write them until the day I die. I'd never say never, but could I do them justice in another season? I'd have to think about it.\"\"The fact that so many people are asking is really encouraging,\" she added.All episodes of \"Sirens\" are now streaming on Netflix.Read the original article on Business Insider Glenn Howerton as Ethan, Milly Alcock as Simone, and Meghann Fahy as Devon in \"Sirens.\"NetflixNetflix's \"Sirens\" centers on two sisters and an alluring billionaire.The five-episode series takes place over the course of Labor Day weekend at a ritzy seaside estate.\"Sirens\" is classified as a limited series, and Netflix hasn't announced plans for another season.Warning: Major spoilers ahead for \"Sirens.\"Netflix's new dark comedy \"Sirens\" is so addictive, it may leave fans calling out for more.\"Sirens\" takes place over Labor Day weekend on a lavish island called Port Haven, where aspiring lawyer Simone DeWitt (Milly Alcock) is working as a live-in assistant to the enigmatic and alluring billionaire Michaela Kell (Julianne Moore).

She and Devon have an emotional goodbye, knowing that they're embarking on completely different paths.On the ferry ride out of Port Haven, Devon runs into Michaela, who's been ousted from Cliff House and has no idea where she's headed.Devon apologizes for accusing Michaela of being a murderer and a cult leader, and Michaela accepts her apology and encourages Devon to cash the $10,000 check she gave her at the start of the series so she can fund a better life for herself in Buffalo.The series concludes with Simone, wearing an elegant light-blue gown that Michaela got her for the gala, standing at the cliff, staring at the vista during sunset with the hint of a smile.Will 'Sirens' return for season two?Milly Alcock as Simone in \"Sirens.\"NetflixThe short answer: probably not.\"Sirens\" is categorized and promoted as a Netflix limited series. That said, a second season isn't entirely unlikely.\"Adolescence\" skyrocketed in popularity since its debut in March and is currently Netflix's third most-watched English-language show of all time, behind season one of \"Wednesday\" and season four of \"Stranger Things.\" Although it was labeled as a limited series, Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, is reportedly interested in some form of a second season of \"Adolescence\" after the first season's success.Considering how well \"Sirens\" has pe",

Joseph Janus recalled the moment he heard that his brother, Adam Janus, had died: \"I got a phone call, they said my brother Adam had a heart attack. I said 'What are you talking about?

        "description": "A State Farm sponsorship enabled Hartbeat to greenlight the YouTube show \"Caddie and the Kid.\"Hartbeat via YouTubeYouTube described how it's using cultural sponsorships to attract advertisers and make TV-like shows.The pitch comes as Netflix and other studios compete for YouTube creators.YouTube is trying to connect brands to producers like Hartbeat, which a brand helped to fund a new show.As Hollywood warms up to creators, YouTube has been pitching new sponsorship packages that combine creator content with major cultural moments like the Oscars, Black Friday, and the PGA Championship.Hollywood has been courting YouTube's creators as it grows on the TV screen. Netflix, for one, has been beating the drum that it's financially better for creators than YouTube.YouTube doesn't pay creators directly for content or own it, unlike the legacy Hollywood model. Apart from a short-lived experiment in funding its own shows, it's stuck with supporting creators with tools like automatic dubbing, a TV-like interface to promote binge-watching, and features that let creators comment on and react to live events. And, of course, it typically shares 55% of the revenue from ads shown on creators' videos. YouTube execs often tout the $70 billion the company paid to creators, artists, and media companies over three years.YouTube has had limited success attracting blue-chip advertisers who have a bias for TV-like shows, though, something top creators like Sean Evans have complained about.The company's latest advertiser pitch hopes to change that.In the first of what YouTube hopes will be many examples, State Farm owned the recent PGA Championship on YouTube. It ran ads on trending videos, takeovers on golf channels from creators like Grant Horvat and Good Good, and an integration into the new LOL Network series \"Caddie & the Kid\" from Kevin Hart's Hartbeat.\"We can take that formula and literally apply it to any major moment on the calendar to ultimately help our clients tap into what we're calling the game on the game around the game phenomena,\" Brian Albert, managing director of YouTube Media Partnerships and Creative Works, told Business Insider.Hartbeat has made plenty of ad-supported shows for YouTube, but this was the first time YouTube brought an advertiser to the table. State Farm's involvement enabled Hartbeat to greenlight the show and spend more on episode length, travel, and talent, said Janina Lundy, who heads marketing and brand partnerships for Hartbeat. \"Caddie & the Kid\" follows MLB Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. and comedian and former caddie Michael Collins on their golfing adventures.\"It definitely did allow for it to be a bit more premium,\" Lundy said of State Farm's impact.YouTube wants more TV-like showsYouTube viewing is increasingly happening in the living room, and the platform is trying to keep the growth going. YouTube has been No. 1 in streaming watch time for the past few years, the company said in February, citing Nielsen data. That puts it ahead of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon's Prime Video. YouTube also shared that TV had become the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US, surpassing mobile in watch time.As YouTube becomes a bigger deal on TVs, big brand deals can help the platform improve the production value of its shows without paying upfront costs.YouTube is picking shows for its cultural moments packages that look like traditional TV, where it knows people tune in for those live events. Hartbeat makes shows specifically for YouTube but also makes cinematic entertainment for streamers, for example.Whether advertisers will buy in is an open question. Some are still unconvinced that YouTube content is on par with traditional TV. Two top video ad buyers told BI there are plenty of other places to buy into the cultural conversation, so YouTube's pitch is hardly unique.Advertisers who can afford to buy ads around the actual sports content may be less interested in a creator's spin on it. However, for those with smaller budgets who value YouTube's audience, its pitch could be attractive, one of the buyers said.If YouTube's pitch succeeds with bigger advertisers, it could broaden creators' access to advertisers and revenue.

Netflix, for one, has been beating the drum that it's financially better for creators than YouTube.YouTube doesn't pay creators directly for content or own it, unlike the legacy Hollywood model. Apart from a short-lived experiment in funding its own shows, it's stuck with supporting creators with tools like automatic dubbing, a TV-like interface to promote binge-watching, and features that let creators comment on and react to live events. And, of course, it typically shares 55% of the revenue from ads shown on creators' videos. YouTube execs often tout the $70 billion the company paid to creators, artists, and media companies over three years.YouTube has had limited success attracting blue-chip advertisers who have a bias for TV-like shows, though, something top creators like Sean Evans have complained about.The company's latest advertiser pitch hopes to change that.In the first of what YouTube hopes will be many examples, State Farm owned the recent PGA Championship on YouTube. It ran ads on trending videos, takeovers on golf channels from creators like Grant Horvat and Good Good, and an integration into the new LOL Network series \"Caddie & the Kid\" from Kevin Hart's Hartbeat.\"We can take that formula and literally apply it to any major moment on the calendar to ultimately help our clients tap into what we're calling the game on the game around the game phenomena,\" Brian Albert, managing director of YouTube Media Partnerships and Creative Works, told Business Insider.Hartbeat has made plenty of ad-supported shows for YouTube, but this was the first time YouTube brought an advertiser to the table. State Farm's involvement enabled Hartbeat to greenlight the show and spend more on episode length, travel, and talent, said Janina Lundy, who heads marketing and brand partnerships for Hartbeat. \"Caddie & the Kid\" follows MLB Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. and comedian and former caddie Michael Collins on their golfing adventures.\"It definitely did allow for it to be a bit more premium,\" Lundy said of State Farm's impact.YouTube wants more TV-like showsYouTube viewing is increasingly happening in the living room, and the platform is trying to keep the growth going. YouTube has been No. 1 in streaming watch time for the past few years, the company said in February, citing Nielsen data. That puts it ahead of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon's Prime Video. YouTube also shared that TV had become the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US, surpassing mobile in watch time.As YouTube becomes a bigger deal on TVs, big brand deals can help the platform improve the production value of its shows without paying upfront costs.YouTube is picking shows for its cultural moments packages that look like traditional TV, where it knows people tune in for those live events. Hartbeat makes shows specifically for YouTube but also makes cinematic entertainment for streamers, for example.Whether advertisers will buy in is an open question. Some are still unconvinced that YouTube content is on par with traditional TV. Two top video ad buyers told BI there are plenty of other places to buy into the cultural conversation, so YouTube's pitch is hardly unique.Advertisers who can afford to buy ads around the actual sports content may be less interested in a creator's spin on it. However, for those with smaller budgets who value YouTube's audience, its pitch could be attractive, one of the buyers said.If YouTube's pitch succeeds with bigger advertisers, it could broaden creators' access to advertisers and revenue. Except for the top level, YouTube creators often don't have direct relationships with blue-chip advertisers. Those who get chosen for \"cultural\" sponsorships, as YouTube calls them, would also get extra exposure on a dedicated hub to help them get discovered.\"Many of our top creators have their own teams that have been trying to source brand partnerships for years. We've been facilitating these connections as well,\" Albert said. \"What's new now is just the fact that we're wrapping it around this cultural moments' calendar.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Meghan carries many titles these days. Besides being the Duchess of Sussex, she’s a podcaster, a philanthropist, a children’s book author, the star of a Netflix show, and the founder of a direct-to-consumer startup. But when I sit down to speak with her, she says she’s recently taken on a new role: that of Tooth Fairy. Archie, her 6-year-old son, recently lost his first tooth. Meghan rushed home to ensure she could be the one to leave a little money and a small dinosaur under his pillow. At 2 a.m., Archie woke Meghan up excitedly to tell her what had happened. “I had a lot of business meetings the next morning, but I still chose to cuddle with him the rest of the night,” she says. “Those mom moments energize me to be a better founder, a better employer, a better boss.” These are the kinds of work life details that Meghan likes to get into in her podcast series, Confessions of a Female Founder, made with the production company Lemonada Media (which is also behind podcasts by Sarah Silverman and David Duchovny, among others). It has had more than 800,000 downloads since its April launch. On the show, Meghan talks with female founders about the origins of their business, along the lines of Guy Raz’s How I Built This. But the show also has another dimension: It allows Meghan to get practical advice about launching her own lifestyle brand, As Ever. “I’m pulling back the curtain to allow people to see the candid experience of being a founder,” Meghan says. In the eight-part series, she’s spoken to guests ranging from Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd to Kitsch’s Cassandra Thurswell. The finale, released May 27, features Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx and Sneex. Sara Blakely [Photo: Bennett Raglin/Getty Images/Fast Company] A Pioneering Netflix Deal In her conversation with Blakely, Meghan talks about how she partnered with Netflix to create As Ever, her new brand, which launched in February. The line included products like tea, jams, honey, cookie mixes, and her iconic “flower sprinkles,” which are edible flower petals that spruce up dishes (priced between $9 and $28). Over the past few years, even as Netflix’s subscriber numbers have continued to show impressive growth (it added 18.91 million subscribers, a year-over-year increase of 15.9%, in the fourth quarter of 2024), it has also been exploring how it can create products tied to the content of shows. The streaming service now has an online shop that sells everything from cosplay costumes for Squid Game to Stranger Things bomber jackets. With Bridgerton, one of Netflix’s biggest hits, the streaming service produced its own products, like coffee mugs, but also licensed Bridgerton branding to other companies, like Hill House Home and Selkie, to produce dresses. Meghan says that she had been exploring various ways of launching a business when Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, approached her. “At the time, I had been working towards building out my own in-house team,” Meghan says. “But I had a complete U-turn because I completely bought into the vision she was sharing, which is where content and commerce meet, not in a product placement way, but rather in an ideological way.” In many ways, this is a pioneering partnership for Netflix. Along with Meghan, the Netflix team decided that it made sense for As Ever to exists on its own, without any Netflix branding. This is why the line isn’t called, “With Love, Meghan,” like the show. “The brand is in the same universe at the show, but they’re not the same,” Meghan says. Meghan also points out that Netflix is not just a financial backer. The company’s consumer packaged goods team works closely with Meghan’s team to manufacture the products. “We are on calls daily, working through product development, SKUs, and inventory,” she says. “We have a field trip tomorrow to look at different manufacturers and suppliers as we expand the brand.” What Comes Next for As Ever As Ever’s first collection was a runaway success. Meghan says that even though the team spent a year preparing the line and forecasting demand, all the products on the site sold out in 45 minutes. Now, they’re trying to plan As Ever’s next phase. The easiest thing to do would have been to simply restock the products, which would likely sell out very quickly again. But instead, Meghan wants to take a step back, gather data from the launch, and figure out exactly what As Ever could be. She says she’s planning to announce new products in the first quarter of 2026. There are some clues about what new items might be in the pipeline. Meghan’s trademark application for her brand includes things like cookbooks, tableware, cutlery, and serving ware. “I want to really focus on the hospitality angle of As Ever, but as we take the learnings, we can understand what the customer’s needs are seasonally,” she says. There are now many models for successful celebrity brands. As Meghan contemplates what comes next, there are many directions she could go, from focusing on a single product category, like Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty and Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS, to a broader play, like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company. But for now, she believes it makes sense to build a brand around a single idea. “My heart is very deeply in my home,” she says. “Everything comes from being rooted in the love story of your home and garden, and then you can imagine different verticals coming out of that.” In the future, though, the sky’s the limit. I ask whether she might explore a clothing business, since many women are drawn to her personal style. “The category of fashion is something I will explore at a later date, because I do think that’s an interesting space for me,” she says. As she continues building As Ever, there’s a good chance we’ll hear about her twists and turns through through a podcast. There’s interest in doing a second season of Confessions of a Female Founder, and many female founders have approached her to be a guest on the series. But Meghan is now involved in such a wide range of projects, she’s sure to find some way to tell her story. “If I had to write a résumé, I don’t know what I would call myself,” she says. “I think it speaks to this chapter many of us find ourselves in, where none of us are one note. But I believe all the notes I am playing are part of the same song.”",

Stockton Rush, the late CEO of OceanGate.Shannon Stapleton/ReutersNetflix is releasing a documentary about the OceanGate Titan submersible disaster.The sub imploded in 2023 while descending to view the Titanic wreck, killing all five people on board.The documentary takes a closer look at the incident and the late OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.An upcoming Netflix documentary is set to take a closer look at the Titan submersible's ill-fated journey to the wreck of the Titanic two years ago.\"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster\" arrives on Netflix on June 11 and will examine the events leading up to the doomed expedition that killed OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush and four others after the vessel carrying them to view the wreck imploded in June 2023.The trailer for the documentary shows interviews with several people close to the late exec and who worked for the expedition company.\"There was no way of knowing when Titan was going to fail,\" Rob McCallum, a former OceanGate advisor, says in the trailer. \"But it was a mathematical certainty that it would fail.\"The trailer also teases interviews with ex-OceanGate staff members like Tony Nissen, a former engineering director at the firm, Bonnie Carl, a human resources and finance director, and David Lochridge, an operations director who previously said he was fired after raising safety concerns about the sub.In the trailer, Lochridge says he thought Rush \"wanted fame\" to \"fuel his ego,\" while Nissen adds that he thought Stockton was \"a borderline psychopath.\" Elsewhere in the clip, Carl recalls her reaction after she said Rush announced she would be the company's next sub pilot: \"Are you nuts? I'm an accountant.\"OceanGate Expeditions' Titan submersible.OceanGate Expeditions via AP, FileAs well as testimonies from key figures, \"Titan: The OceanGate Disaster\" will also feature \"pivotal\" audio recordings and footage from OceanGate's early days, per the documentary's synopsis.Speaking in an interview with Netflix's Tudum, director Mark Monroe said he had been \"horrified and mesmerized\" by the coverage and social commentary on the sub and that he hoped the documentary could provide answers about how the disaster happened.\"The more I dug into this terrible tragedy, the more intrigued I became about how this could have ever happened in the first place, and who exactly was the man who built and then went down with this ship,\" he said. \"We hope that this film can help provide answers to these very questions.\"Earlier this week, the US Coast Guard released footage showing the moment that Rush's wife, Wendy Rush, heard the apparent sound of the Titan submersible imploding.Wendy can be seen trying to contact the sub from a support vessel when a loud slamming sound can be heard through a monitor.\"What was that bang?\" she said.The submersible lost communication with the support vessel — the Polar Prince — around an hour and 45 minutes into its dive, sparking a dramatic four-day search and rescue effort.Debris from the Titan was eventually found by a remotely operated vehicle around 500 meters (roughly 1,640 feet) from the bow of the Titanic, which lies around 12,500 feet below the surface.Alongside Rush, British pilot and adventurer Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, and former French Navy diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet died in the incident.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "From Netflix to Disney Plus, the list of streaming options feels endless. We're here to help you figure out which apps are the best streaming services. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreNetflix; Disney+; Apple TV; Amazon Prime Video; Disney+; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/Business InsiderOnce upon a time, streaming services started and ended with Netflix and Hulu. Now, there's a seemingly endless array of apps to choose from, which can be both a blessing and a curse. We're here to help you find the best streaming services for your needs.For instance, Disney Plus is an ideal service for families and fans of Marvel and \"Star Wars,\" while ESPN Plus is the best option for sports fanatics. Viewers interested in prestige TV and unscripted favorites will want to check out Max, and Apple TV Plus is notable for offering one of the most affordable ad-free plans on the market.There are two core tenets to streaming services: general interest (such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus) and programming-specific (think of Apple TV Plus, Peacock, and Paramount Plus). And then there are your live TV streaming channel packages, like Sling TV, which function as month-to-month cable alternatives. No one needs every streaming service, and the \"right\" ones ultimately come down to personal taste and need.It might be hard to remember, but streaming services were once meant to make it easier to watch your favorite things. We're here to help you make that true again. To help you decide what to sign up for (and keep you from draining your wallet), we've rounded up the best streaming services of 2025 and explained what makes each unique, keeping different budgets and viewing habits in mind.Our top picks for the best streaming servicesBest for families: Disney PlusBest for cord-cutters: Sling TVBest for NBC fans: PeacockBest for CBS fans: Paramount PlusBest for fans of ABC and FOX: HuluBest ad-free plan on a budget: Apple TV PlusBest for critically acclaimed content: MaxBest for sports: ESPN PlusBest for online shoppers: Amazon Prime VideoBest for originals: NetflixBest for familiesDisney Plus with ads: $10/monthDisney Plus without ads: $16/month or $160/yearDisney Plus with ESPN Plus and Hulu: starts at $17/monthDisney Plus is the subscription streaming home of the studio's many classic animated films and blockbuster franchises. With that in mind, its main draw is its wide catalog of Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and 20th Century Studios content. This makes it one of the best streaming services for families since it's packed with entertainment geared toward younger audiences. There are some new original films, series, and concert specials as well, but the lineup isn't as large as what you'll find on Netflix or Amazon. Still, the service has a healthy pipeline of exclusives for members to enjoy, including a new Star Wars series called \"Star Wars: Skeleton Crew.\" Disney Plus is also the exclusive US streaming destination for new episodes of \"Doctor Who.\" Disney Plus has dedicated sections for each of the studio's biggest brands.Disney PlusAnd even though its catalog is geared toward families, there's still a healthy assortment of PG-13 movies and shows produced for young adults. Disney Plus' selection of R-rated movies and TV-MA shows is vastly limited compared to services like Netflix and Max, although the number is slowly growing. Right now, the only notable programs for mature audiences are a handful of Marvel titles like \"Deadpool\" and \"Agatha All Along.\"As a result, adults may want to supplement Disney Plus with a second streaming service to fill their palette with more mature shows. If you fall into that boat, we recommend paying a bit more to get the Disney Plus Bundle with Hulu and ESPN Plus. Bundle members can now access Hulu and ESPN Plus within the Disney Plus interface, so you can unlock all of Hulu's mature offerings without switching apps. Read our Disney Plus guide and Disney Plus review.Best for cord-cuttersSling Orange: $46/monthSling Blue: $46/monthSling Orange + Blue: $61/monthSeveral of the services in this article offer live streaming for select events or a single channel, especially in the premium subscriptions, but true cord-cutters might need a live TV streaming channel package. You can find a full breakdown of these apps in our heavily tested guide to the best live TV streaming services, but Sling TV is a great entry point.Sling is one of the most affordable live TV streaming services on the market, and we dubbed the service the best for the essentials when it comes to live TV. The streamer offers two base plans, Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which start at $46/month. The plans carry anywhere from 35-40+ live channels each, with some overlapping, but you can also combine the two plans for $61 in total.Sling TV is the live TV streaming service that is best for the essentials.SlingWe break down the differences in our Sling Orange vs. Blue plan, but Orange is best known for its broad ESPN offerings, in addition to Disney Channel and 33 other live channels. At the time of writing, it's the cheapest way to live stream the ESPN network in the US. Blue offers a greater variety of channel genres, from sports options like the NFL Network to news channels like MSNBC to lifestyle networks like Bravo. Notably, Blue offers select local channel coverage (FOX, ABC, and/or NBC) in certain regions. Both subscriptions carry TNT, CNN, and other channels, and you can add on genre extras as you please.While you'll probably still need a few other streaming services to round out your watch options, Sling TV is a great way to cover your bases if you've cut the cord. Its greatest merit comes with covering some of the best channels you just can't watch without a live TV streaming service, like ESPN, which doesn't offer a direct 1:1 live stream on ESPN Plus.Read our Sling TV review.Best for NBC fansPeacock Premium: $8/month or $80/year for ad-supported streaming access to the full Peacock libraryPeacock Premium Plus: $14/month or $140/year for ad-free access to the full Peacock library, as well as live NBC streamingPeacock is the streaming home of current and classic NBCUniversal shows like \"The Voice,\" \"SNL,\" \"30 Rock,\" and \"The Office,\" as well as original titles like \"Poker Face\" and \"Twisted Metal.\" The service also offers a rotating slate of hit movies, including recent Universal titles straight from theaters.Peacock used to offer a free plan with a limited content selection, but this is no longer available for new members. Instead, the current entry-level option is Peacock Premium, which offers ad-supported access to everything on the service for $8 a month. To unlock ad-free playback, you can pay $14 a month for Peacock Premium Plus. The top tier also adds livestreaming access to NBC so you can watch your local station without an antenna or cable.Peacock is an affordable service with lots of NBCUniversal content.PeacockPeacock also has some live news and sports broadcasts. Most notably, the service is home to WWE events, the Tour de France, and Sunday Night Football when the NFL season is active. Like NBC livestreaming, major sporting events on the network are typically restricted to Premium Plus members. However, live coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics was available to all Peacock members, as are other select live events.The app is also one of the best downloads a reality TV fan can make since it is the exclusive on-demand streaming home of Bravo content. Peacock has the full collection of \"Real Housewives\" programming, in addition to favorites like \"Top Chef\" and \"Vanderpump Rules.\"Subscribers can stream some titles in 4K with HDR, but the catalog is mostly limited to a few new movies. Compared to other services, Peacock has one of the smallest 4K collections, but it has been adding more 4K titles in recent months.Read our Peacock TV guide.Best for CBS fansParamount Plus Essential: $8/month or $60/year for ad-supported streamingParamount Plus with Showtime: $13/month or $120/year for commercial-free streaming, along with Showtime and live CBSParamount Plus is a subscription streaming service from ViacomCBS. The platform gives viewers access to a large collection of on-demand shows and movies. The premium plan also includes live CBS streaming, so you can watch your local CBS network without cable or a digital antenna. This is an especially crucial tier since CBS is often the local network missing from live TV streaming services.In addition to CBS, Paramount Plus draws programming from Viacom cable channels like MTV, BET, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon. Paramount Plus is also home to exclusive series like \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" \"Halo,\" and \"Yellowstone\" spinoffs like \"1883\" and \"1923.\" Paramount Plus Premium members now get Showtime included.Paramount PlusThe streaming service adds new Paramount movies to its lineup after they play in theaters, including releases like the \"Mean Girls\" musical and \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning.\"Sports fans can also tune into local NFL games broadcast on CBS and UEFA soccer matches when each season is in session. Unlike live CBS access, NFL and soccer games are available to all members, even those subscribed to the cheaper ad-supported plan. If the base Paramount Plus library isn't enough, you can get Paramount Plus with Showtime to stream even more movies and shows. The two services merged in June 2023, and Showtime now comes with the ad-free tier of Paramount Plus by default. Once subscribed, you unlock Showtime movies and shows directly in the Paramount Plus app, so this is a solid option if you're looking to stream \"Dexter: Original Sin\" or the latest season of \"Yellowjackets.\"Read our Paramount Plus streaming service guide and our Paramount Plus review.Best for fans of ABC and FOXHulu with ads: $10/monthHulu without ads: $19/monthHulu with Disney Plus and ESPN Plus: starts at $17/monthHulu with Disney Plus and Max: starts at $17/mont",

        "description": "It’s easy to forget how big a splash the first Roku box made when it debuted on May 20, 2008. At launch, the device worked only with Netflix, best known at the time as a mail-order Blockbuster rival that was just ramping up its streaming service. The 10,000 movies and shows you could watch skewed toward the random and musty: Back then, Netflix’s mail-order DVD service offered 10 times as many titles. But the $100 Netflix Player by Roku took a process that had been geeky at best—getting internet video onto a TV—and made it approachable and affordable. In the unassuming gadget, wrote The New York Times’s Saul Hansell, “I think you can see the future of video.” Hansell was right. And though that original box has grown quaint with time, Roku is still riding the streaming wave. The company ended 2024 with 89.8 million streaming households, an increase of 9.8 million year over year. In the first quarter of 2025, it streamed 35.8 billion hours of video, up 5.1 billion year over year—and more than 10 times what it was doing per quarter when it went public in 2017. Behind the scenes, Roku has constructed a diversified business to keep those figures growing and monetize them in new ways. Yes, it still makes streaming boxes, along with streaming sticks and soundbars. However, it also provides North America’s most popular operating system for smart TVs, which it licenses to other manufacturers and uses on its own Roku-branded televisions. It operates the Roku Channel, the most-watched free ad-supported streaming channel, having recently passed Tubi. It’s a powerhouse of streaming ads, giving marketers tools such as Roku Ads Manager and Roku Data Cloud. That Roku found itself in a place to build all this involved an early twist of fate. Founder and CEO Anthony Wood oversaw the first streaming box’s development as a skunkworks project for Netflix. When Netflix decided it didn’t want to sell a device of its own, Roku—which had made internet radios and digital signage controllers, among other products—inherited it. With the introduction of the Roku Channel Store in November 2009, the box began to evolve from a Netflix player into a comprehensive streaming portal. The Channel Store launched with 10 providers, including Pandora and Flickr; the company doesn’t disclose the current number, but it’s in the thousands, including more than 500 free ones. Roku founder and CEO Anthony Wood presents at the company’s New York product launch on April 23, 2025. [Photo: Courtesy of Roku] “It’s amazing how companies underestimate that,” Wood says. “They still do. They don’t really understand what it means. For example, sometimes people will be like, ‘Your UI, your home screen, hasn’t changed that much.’ Like that’s terrible. And I’m like, ‘No, our market share keeps going up!’ So it’s not terrible. People like that.” Anyone who scoffs at Roku’s lack of change for change’s sake might want to consider how successful it’s been in a business that many others, including Google and Amazon, have long coveted. “When you think about the power of an operating system, in the mobile world you think of Apple and Google being the two dominant platforms,” says media and technology analyst Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. “In connected TV, the platform that is far and away the largest is Roku.” Hardware is hard Wood’s early realization that devices were most valuable as a springboard to build a platform did not involve any unique insight. Everyone in consumer electronics knows that hardware is hard and services can drive profits. But Roku has been one of the few consumer electronics companies to make it all work—certainly more consistently so than Sonos and GoPro, both of which have been through more than their share of tribulations in recent years. (Fun fact: All three companies were founded in 2002.) Just as Wood anticipated, Roku became a services company. In the first quarter of 2025, it made $881 million in revenue from its platform business, which spans advertising, subscriptions, and software licensing, with a gross profit of 53%. In devices, it had $140 million in revenue but a $19 million loss, for a margin of minus 14%. Overall, the company reported a loss from operations of $58 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $56 million, compared to a $72 million loss and adjusted EBITDA of $41 million for the first quarter of 2024. If you’re watching the Roku Channel—or another streaming service that’s part of the Roku Audience Network—you see ads the company has inserted in streams. (Overall, according to data from Pixalate, 38% of connected-TV programmatic ads in the first quarter of 2025 were delivered to Roku viewers, the highest percentage of any platform; Amazon’s Fire TV was second with 18%.) If you’re watching something else, such as Disney+ or Max, Roku can monetize that, too: Its built-in payments service, Roku Pay, lets it handle billing in return for a fee. Roku’s use of its platform as a giant marketing opportunity for its streaming partners extends to everything from its home screen and screen saver to the dedicated app-specific buttons on its familiar remote control; in March, it raised eyebrows by testing ads that play even before the home screen loads. As I was finishing this article, the platform was thick with messages promoting discounts associated with Streaming Day on May 20—a holiday it invented to celebrate the anniversary of its first box. Anti-Roku sentiment expressed online usually reflects frustration with the quantity of advertising and other promotional elements, though the company recently got blamed for some ads it didn’t place. Wood says that customer satisfaction studies help determine changes to the platform, but in some cases tweaks get the go-ahead even “if there’s a very neutral [reaction] or a slight decrease in satisfaction. Because you’ve got to remember, the revenue ultimately [results] in more content, more free content, more features, and lower cost.” Overall, he adds, “Those revenue streams have really worked for us—distributing streaming services, merchandising them, selling them, billing for them, and free content with ads.” If Roku hadn’t done an intrepid job of navigating a TV hardware ecosystem that’s radically changed since it shipped its early devices, it wouldn’t have a booming ad business. Back then, few people owned smart TVs; the company’s competition consisted of other boxes, most of which were clunkier and costlier than its own. But as streaming took off, most TVs added it as a standard feature. Theoretically, that could have rendered Roku and its add-on boxes redundant. The reality, however, was that the home-brewed software cobbled together by many TV manufacturers was terrible. That opened up an opportunity for Roku, whose interface was already widely praised for its polish and straightforwardness. In 2014, the company introduced Roku TV, a platform designed to be embedded into televisions rather than delivered via a box. It launched on models from China’s TCL and Hisense, respectively the third- and fifth-largest TV brands at the time. Looking back, Wood says that TV makers were skittish about ceding control of the on-screen experience. “When we first started going to TV companies, one of the biggest challenges we had was they all wanted a custom UI, and they didn’t want their UI to look like their competitors,” he remembers. In the end, many were convinced to standardize on Roku, which now ships on TVs from 35 brands, including JVC, Walmart’s Onn house brand, Philips, and Westinghouse. In some cases, they play up the platform’s brand and benefits on their packaging even more than their own. Among the TV manufacturers who still don’t offer Roku models are three of the best-known brands: Samsung, LG, and Sony. Wood contends that’s worse news for them than for Roku. “Samsung still makes their own platform,” he says. “They just don’t have enough scale and monetization, even as large as they are, to do what we do in terms of features. . . . And so we’re just a better product, and consumers care about that.” Then there are the most Roku-centric TVs of all. In 2023, the company introduced its own line of televisions; it went on to sell a million of them in 2024. Are the TV makers who license Roku’s software okay with it competing with their products? “They’d probably prefer we didn’t,” allows Wood, who calls it “just another move to build market share.” Along with catering to customers who want the purest possible Roku experience, doing so lets the company test new features before rolling them out more widely, he explains. It also helps retailers plug holes in their TV lineups when they can’t get all the models they’d like from other brands. Even in an age of smart TVs, Roku’s streaming sticks aren’t done evolving. [Photo: Courtesy of Roku] At the launch event where I spoke with Wood, Roku unveiled its 2025 line of TVs. But it also introduced two new add-on streaming devices—not boxes but sticks that plug directly into a TV’s HDMI port, a diminutive form factor the company has offered since 2012. It’s still finding ways to improve them: The new models are slimmer than their predecessors, so they don’t block adjacent HDMI ports. They also draw power from the TV, eliminating the need for a cable and charging plug. Given that it’s now tough to buy a TV that doesn’t have streaming features built in, how is it possible that these sticks are still a thing? Even inside Roku, Wood says, many people expected the market for them to trend sharply toward zero. So far, it hasn’t: “Every year we keep selling them—we sell a lot of streaming sticks.” Some customers, he says, use them to upgrade aging smart TVs whose built-in software is no longer getting updates. Others may simply prefer Roku to other streaming interfaces. Ro",

        "description": "In the entertainment industry, as in life, change is the only constant. It wasn’t that long ago that streaming services such as Netflix were the outsiders making waves and altering the way audiences watched movies. Today, there’s a new kid on the block rapidly growing in popularity. Vertical dramas, essentially a 90-minute soap opera broken down into one-minute episodes viewed—you guessed it—vertically on smartphones, are here to shake things up even further. (I know this firsthand as an actor who has recently worked on some of these projects.) Joey Jia, the CEO of Crazy Maple Studios, is at the forefront of this movement. His content creation company was named one of 2024’s TIME100 Most Influential Companies and has offices in Shenzhen, Beijing, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Canada, Mexico, and the Philippines. Under this banner, Jia created ReelShort in 2022, a short-form video-streaming app, when he realized there was an opportunity to marry growing romance book trends and Asian micro dramas. “I noticed there is a trend,” Jia told Fast Company. “People started shooting short-form content, especially five minutes long, 10 minutes long. That inspired me to have this idea: What if we revamp the video industry?” Jia decided to put stories into one-minute bite-size content, made specifically for mobile phones as a way of testing how the market would respond. Spoiler alert: It responded well. ReelShorts’s production on track to triple in 2025 as compared to 2024. While Crazy Maple Studios declined to share revenue figures, it says it’s seen impressive growth in monthly active users, from around 45 million in October to between 55 to 60 million monthly active users. Suffice it to say, it’s in demand, paving the way for a story format that might be the future of scripted entertainment. At the intersection of art and tech The growing popularity of vertical dramas could never have occurred without the proper technology in place. The first smartphone, the Simon Personal Communicator, was invented by IBM in 1992, but it would take 18 years before these devices made their way to everyone’s pockets. Apple’s iPhone, famously announced to the world by Steve Jobs in 2007, played a big role in spreading the adoption of smartphones. The next stepping stone to verticals was social media. When TikTok was first released in 2016, it further trained users to create and view videos vertically. Instagram strengthened this habit when the app released its similar Reels feature in 2020. The stage was set for professional creators to monetize this technology. How China got there first In 2019, the Chinese company iQIYI released a special feature on its app dubbed the Vertical Video Zone, which comprised 25 sets of video, all shot in portrait mode to be viewed on a mobile phone. Around the same time, the Chinese social media platform Kuaishou unveiled “Kuaishou Small Theatre” on its app. This comedy-centered, short-form content would lead to the “micro-drama” brand Xingmang Micro Drama. By 2023, the platform would have over 94 million paid users. That same year, the larger micro-drama industry in China brought in $5.3 billion, making it 70% as large as the country’s traditional film industry. According to DataEye, a Shenzhen-based research firm, micro-dramas out-earned domestic box office sales the following year, as the Los Angeles Times reported. The American company Quibi, led by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, tried to put its own spin on this trend, launching in April of 2020. This app utilized “turnstyle” technology that allowed viewers to watch content both vertically and horizontally. However, its short-form videos were expensive to make, running about 10 minutes utilizing Hollywood stars. Just seven months after its creation, Quibi was forced to shut down due to low subscriber counts. ‘Emotion-driven stories,’ made for humans by humans Jia saw a potential opening in the American market and learned from Quibi’s failure. He attributes ReelShorts’s success to its focus on “emotion-driven stories.” Plot is “the missing component,” he says, “So our job is to come up with a feel-good moment, feel-good stories, and we always have data to make sure we are on the right track. So our stories are evolving.” Vertical dramas tend to use well-known, over-the-top storytelling tropes, such as enemies to lovers, Cinderella-type makeovers, and corporate revenge. Some even explore fantasy plotlines, such as werewolves and different historical eras. ReelShorts’s subscription service differs from traditional streamers because it is not a flat monthly fee. The first 10 or so episodes are free, but to see the story’s conclusion, users have to pay based on consumption. This forces writers to make sure their content is fast-paced but not so quick that the audience gets lost. “There is a fine balance between the story beats and the emotions. So this is really tricky,” Jia mused. Jia trains directors, producers, and screenwriters in-house and does not utilize artificial intelligence. “I think of creativity coming from a human being, so I don’t trust AI, to be honest,” Jia explained. He also uses simple, inexpensive sets and costumes, and unknown nonunion actors. What does the future hold? When asked if Jia thinks vertical dramas complement or disrupt the traditional movie and television industry, he replied: “I think it’s a disruptor. I think mobile entertainment will become a brand-new industry in the next few years. It will coexist with a traditional film industry, but it will bypass and beat the size so it gets bigger and bigger.” He thinks colleges will in the not-so-distant future add this format to its film school curriculum. As more and more people forgo traditional movie theaters while staying glued to their phones throughout much of the day, his predictions don’t feel that far-fetched. Indeed, the average ReelShort user might surprise you. “We initially thought the majority of our audience is like a teenager and younger demographic—but no, it’s full spectrum,” Jia explained. Jia has already been approached by big-name studios but finds it difficult to work with established intellectual properties because of all the rules and hoops to jump through. Verticals are inexpensive to make and move quickly, with a movie essentially completed in about 11 days. That doesn’t mean he isn’t open to bigger collaborations. In the next five years, Jia aims to prove that this space has merit, saying he feels there is still very much a stigma attached to it. “There’s wide opportunity here,” he says. “So the door is always open.” Jia is not alone in this space. Shelly Caldwell founded DramaBox, a mobile TV series company, in 2022. Similarly, ShortMax, a Chinese-based media company, was created in 2023 by Jiuzhou Wenhua. Other players in the game include FlexTV and LokShorts. Even Netflix is dipping its toe in the pool. It recently announced that for some select users, its app will begin testing a vertical video feed. Meanwhile, ReelShort is expanding into new genres, such as action. Undercover Prison King, the story of a private prison owner who poses as an inmate to reveal corruption, is performing very well. The recent in-person premiere of Wings of Fire: The Dragonslayer Is My Ex-Lover in Culver City successfully signaled verticals’ legitimacy to the larger City of Angels. Jia also recently launched ReelShort Publishing House, a new division that will novelize popular romance titles on the app, a full circle moment for the man who saw the desire for this content early on. With a distribution deal with Amazon already in place, audiences may soon find themselves asking which came first, the vertical or the novel? As the way we consume media continues to evolve, Jia’s foresight appears to have been the fulfillment of a prophecy of sorts. What direction is the future of entertainment going? It appears to be vertical.",

        "description": "Anyone asking how to get to Sesame Street will have a new answer as of this morning: Just log on to Netflix. The industry leader in streaming, which topped 300 million global subscribers last December and reported revenue of $10.5 billion for the first quarter in 2025, just picked up Sesame Street ahead of its 56th season. That’s after HBO wound down its deal with the beloved children’s institution last December. Although financial details about Netflix’s new arrangement are not yet publicly available, HBO reportedly paid $30–$35 million annually for rights to the edutainment lodestar. Whatever price Netflix is paying to add the series to its robust slate of children’s programs, which includes Cocomelon, it’s likely a bargain, considering the intangibles. With this deal, Netflix created a lot more than just a new home for Big Bird, Cookie Monster and the rest of the gang; by allowing the embattled PBS network to freely air new episodes as they roll out, Netflix just elegantly orchestrated the feel-good corporate PR coup of the year. We are excited to announce that all new Sesame Street episodes are coming to @netflix worldwide along with library episodes, and new episodes will also release the same day on @PBS Stations and @PBSKIDS platforms in the US, preserving a 50+ year relationship.The support of… pic.twitter.com/B76MxQzrpI— Sesame Street (@sesamestreet) May 19, 2025 Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces Sesame Street, has faced rough headwinds in recent months. After losing its lucrative contract with HBO last December, amid a pronounced reduction in children’s programming on the network, the fate of the show was uncertain. Making matters worse, Trump recently moved to cut federal funding to PBS, which has aired Sesame Street for over half a century–and only did so after his administration’s cuts to the U. S. Agency for International Development abruptly deprived Sesame Workshop of valuable grants. The venerable children’s show needed a champion, and into the void stepped the entertainment company whose branding is the color of Elmo. “I strongly believe that our educational programming for children is one of the most important aspects of our service to the American people, and Sesame Street has been an integral part of that critical work for more than half a century,” said Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS, in a statement. “We’re proud to continue our partnership in the pursuit of having a profound impact on the lives of children for years to come.” The new deal will involve a mild cosmetic overhaul. According to The Washington Post, Sesame Street had intended to start a new format of two 11-minute stories, along with a new five-minute animated segment called “Tales from 123,” but the show will now instead feature a single 11-minute story, followed by “Tales from 123,” and then some revived fan favorites such as “Elmo’s World.” The most profound change in the new deal, though, will have nothing to do with the content, but in how it’s delivered. When HBO began airing episodes of Sesame Street in 2016, the show continued to run on PBS, but new episodes only reached the public channel nine months later. This arrangement continued after 2020, when the show transitioned to HBO Max, and remained in place until HBO announced its intention to drop the show last December. In contrast, Netflix’s deal ensures that new episodes will be available on PBS stations and PBS KIDS digital platforms the day they’re released, honoring the creators’ commitment to free, fun educational material for children. “This unique public-private partnership will enable Sesame Workshop to bring our research-based curriculum to young children around the world with Netflix’s global reach, while ensuring children in communities across the U.S. continue to have free access on public television to the Sesame Street they love,” Sesame Workshop CEO Sherri Westin added in the announcement. What makes the deal such a savvy PR move is that it’s a win for the company on several levels. Not only does it provide a sharp contrast between Netflix and the once and future HBO Max, and what might be considered a subtle rebuke to this administration’s attack on publicly funded channels, it also offers a counterpoint to some recent perceptions of Netflix. Over the past couple years, Netflix has made some moves that helped foster an image of the company as more profit-focused and less consumer-friendly. Between the crackdown on password-sharing, multiple price hikes, and sunsetting of the popular Basic ad-free plan, pushing users toward either higher-priced tiers or an ad-based option, the company seemed driven by a shrewd quest to leave no money on the table, no matter who got left behind. By ensuring that American families will be able to access new episodes of Sesame Street for free for the first time in a decade, however, Netflix has demonstrated it has more on its mind than the bottom line. It’s the kind of message that resonates with would-be subscribers, and it should go a long way toward keeping the clouds away from Netflix’s reputation for some time.",

He later clarified that the decision against an acquisition was not a \"regret,\" though.In 2014, UK-based technology research firm CCS Insight predicted that Google would acquire Netflix in 2015, but there weren't widespread reports about acquisition discussions.Since kicking off its global expansion in 2016, Netflix has been at the forefront of the entertainment industry and has hit over 300 million subscribers.

        "description": "Exciting news for anyone who’s already burned through the entirety of Netflix: there’s a new online movie rental platform coming to town. Letterboxd, the movie tracking app and the preferred social media of your most insufferable film-loving friend, announced this week that a Letterboxd Video Store is on the way. The announcement was made Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival. While the company hasn’t revealed too many specifics just yet, we do know the upcoming streaming service will be called the Letterboxd Video Store and will feature curated “shelves” of handpicked titles. Like other services such as Prime Video, Apple TV, or Google Play, users will be able to rent films on demand or during specified release windows. But don’t expect the usual lineup. These selections will be carefully curated by Letterboxd, spotlighting lesser-known films, emerging filmmakers, and titles from the festival circuit. By showcasing movies that haven’t yet secured wide distribution, Letterboxd aims to position its transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) service as a “potential new path to audience connection for filmmakers and sales agents seeking visibility and momentum.” Details around launch dates, availability by territory, and specific titles will be announced in the coming months. However, the company has confirmed that selections will be informed by “behavioral insight” drawn from its 20 million-strong community of dedicated film lovers. Launched in 2011, the platform, often dubbed the “Goodreads for film,” remained a niche hub for cinephiles for nearly a decade. By mid-2020, it had only 1.8 million members. Today, Letterboxd has gone fully mainstream. Top reviewers enjoy micro-celebrity status, its “Four Favorites” trend routinely goes viral on TikTok, and users gleefully speculate about celebrities’ burner accounts. “Every day, we see members recommending films to each other, adding to their watchlists and hungry to discover more,” Letterboxd CEO Matthew Buchanan said, per The Hollywood Reporter. “Letterboxd Video Store is our way of delivering for those film lovers, creating a dedicated space for films that deserve an audience.”",

Netflix is reportedly about to experiment with placing ads in the middle of its programming. The streaming service has created interactive “mid-roll” and pause ads that incorporate generative artificial intelligence (AI), the publication Media Play News reported Wednesday (May 15) from the company’s upfront to advertisers. “[Netflix] members pay as much attention to midroll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves,” said Amy Reinhard, president of advertising at Netflix. Reinhard said that Netflix’s $7.99 monthly ad-supported subscription tier now has 94 million subscribers worldwide, up from 70 million in November and 40 million ad-supported subscriptions a year ago. This less-expensive option now accounts for half of all new Netflix subscribers, the report added. The company launched an ad-supported option in November 2022. Reinhard said Wednesday that ad-supported subscribers spend around 41 hours per month on the platform. “When you compare us to our competitors, attention starts higher and ends much higher. And even more impressive, members pay as much attention to mid-roll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves,” she said. The new ad-supported plans come at a time when the subscription industry is witnessing a shift to more flexible and diverse pricing models, as PYMNTS wrote earlier this year. “Tiered pricing remains a cornerstone strategy, with companies like Netflix and Spotify offering different levels of access and features to accommodate varying customer needs and budgets,” that report said. “This allows for personalized offerings and maximizes potential revenue.” Research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that 46% of consumers are “deal chasers” and will swap services to get a better deal, while other consumers can be enticed away from being loyal customers with a more affordable price. Meanwhile, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos last month outlined the streaming giant’s vision for growth, which includes the goal of diversifying beyond online streaming while still expanding its core business. During the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025, Sarandos was asked how Netflix plans to reach its goal of becoming a trillion-dollar company, which seems difficult to achieve unless they expand beyond streaming. Sarandos first doubled down on opportunities in its core business, noting that Netflix captures only about 5% of consumer spending and 10% of TV watching time in its most mature markets. Thus, there is “enormous room to grow just in the things that we do,” Sarandos said. The post Netflix Reportedly Weaving GenAI Ads Into Programming appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Discovery's (WBD) streaming service Max will be called HBO Max starting this summer, bringing back a name that WBD curiously ditched a couple of years ago. In May 2020, the company then known as WarnerMedia Group launched its flagship streaming service, HBO Max. The successor to the HBO Now subscription-based streaming service that launched in 2014, and not to be confused with the now-defunct HBO Go (which was a video-on-demand streaming service accessible to those with subscriptions to the HBO cable channel), HBO Max offered “the entire HBO service,” per WarnerMedia’s announcement. HBO Max also combined content from other titles WarnerMedia owned, including titles from DC Comics and Cartoon Network. But the main draw continued to be the ability to stream HBO’s prestigious library via a Netflix-like streaming subscription. When WarnerMedia acquired Discovery in 2022 and became WBD, it sought to combine the libraries of HBO Max and the Discovery+ streaming service. WBD landed on Max as the name for the combined app. The name seemed to suggest access to a maximum amount of streaming content with maximum appeal. However, it questionably distanced itself from the legacy of high-budget, award-winning TV shows and recent popular movies that the HBO brand had been building since 1972.Read full article Comments",

Discovery have adopted different strategies.Netflix has zeroed in on engagement, while others are focused on goals like subscriber growth.These aren't your older sibling's streaming wars.The battle for audiences has evolved in recent months, as once-fierce rivals turn to frenemies and even team up on bundles. One key reason is that Hollywood titans like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have stopped following Netflix and are instead carving out distinct strategies.Netflix is all in on \"engagement\" — how much people are watching and interacting with its platform — and no longer regularly shares its subscriber count, which was once its north star. It also just revamped its homepage with vertical video as it takes cues from social media giants like YouTube and TikTok.Disney, meanwhile, is locked in on subscriber growth. Two Disney streaming employees told Business Insider that attracting new users remains a top priority, especially if they're in its bundles.And Warner Bros. Discovery is prioritizing profitability with Max. Its quality-over-quantity strategy hinges on preventing cancellations instead of reaching everyone or maximizing engagement.Disney, WBD, Comcast, and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.Engagement is in, thanks to adsFor years, Netflix focused on subscriber growth, which Wall Street was obsessed with. But as it approached and cleared the 300 million subscriber milestone, Netflix zeroed in on another goal (besides growing revenue and profit): engagement.A Netflix spokesman said engagement is its \"best proxy for customer satisfaction\" and that highly active viewers are less likely to cancel.Netflix drove about 8% of watch time on connected TVs in the US in March, the most recent data provided by Nielsen. Though Netflix was the highest among its paid streaming rivals, it trailed YouTube, which got 12%.That's why Netflix's co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's first quarter earnings call that there was \"plenty of room to grow\" engagement.NielsenBoosting watch time helps Netflix achieve another top goal: building out its nascent ad business. The company is playing catch-up here. It will generate $2.2 billion in US ad revenue this year, according to EMARKETER, which is well below Hulu's $2.7 billion figure and in line with Peacock. However, those two streamers have had ad businesses for years.eMarketerJohn Conca, a media analyst at Third Bridge, said Netflix's ad business will blossom as it builds out its own ad tech.Amazon is also focused on its streaming ad business, which burst out of the gate in early 2024 thanks to an unconventional opt-out strategy. The e-commerce giant turned on ads for all Prime Video users who don't pay $3 a month to remove them, instantly scaling its ad business. Nearly 34 million of Amazon's 166 million US-based Prime Video users see ads, EMARKETER estimates.Amazon has a treasure trove of shopping data, which Conca said can help boost the effectiveness of its ads.An employee at a rival streamer who recently interviewed at Amazon told BI the company seemed aggressively focused on growing its ad business.Subscriber growth is still in styleNot all streamers have shifted their focus to engagement. Disney still sees plenty of room for subscriber growth, as do midsize players like Paramount+ and Comcast's Peacock.\"Disney is still not focused on engagement, as Netflix is right now,\" one Disney streaming employee said, adding that subscriber count is the main focus. They said engagement should improve as Hulu and ESPN fold into Disney+ through the bundle, though.Engagement still matters to Disney. A second streaming employee said hours watched largely determine if shows or movies are considered hits, though content can also be deemed successful if it drives signups.Disney won't go back to growth at any cost, however.\"Management's made it absolutely crystal clear that yes, they want growth — but it's got to be profitable growth,\" said media analyst Joe Bonner of Argus Research.Growth rarely comes cheap in streaming, as Paramount+ and Peacock have learned.Paramount+ has been a consistent leader in new streaming signups, data firm Antenna found. The company said this month that its global subscriber base had risen 11% in the last year to 79 million.And while Peacock plateaued for a time after the Olympics, the US-only service added 5 million subscribers last quarter, taking its total to 41 million.Despite those gains, neither service is profitable, though both are getting closer. Still, Bonner expects to see the two eventually join forces through a merger or bundle, reasoning that \"it's hard to see them surviving on their own.\"Some on Wall Street are also perplexed by Apple's streaming strategy. Apple TV+ has high-quality shows, but a shallow library means it's plagued by an industry-leading churn rate, per Antenna.\"I'm not sure what the play with Apple TV is,\" Conca said.Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, has acknowledged the challenge of building a streaming library from scratch.\"We're betting everything on the shows that we're doing,\" Cue said in March. \"The ones that we do, they all need to stick. Otherwise, we have nothing else.\"All about the bottom lineWhile all of these streamers are looking to make money, some are more focused on profitability than others.WBD once hoped Max would challenge Netflix. In 2023, it dropped HBO from its streamer's brand so the service could have \"truly something for everyone,\" as CEO David Zaslav once said.But after a slow start, executives pared content spending and doubled down on its strengths.\"We're not going to flood the zone,\" Zaslav said on the company's first quarter earnings call. \"We want to be telling the best stories, and we want to also be taking advantage of all the great quality content over the years.\"Max no longer aspires to be a Netflix killer, but it may not have to be.WBD successfully bundled its streamer with Disney+ and Hulu. Max is smaller than streaming titans but is steadily growing, though that's mainly due to international expansion.While Max now has a lower ceiling, it's profitable. That's crucial for WBD, considering its hefty debt load. Max might not win the streaming wars, but it can still be a winner.Read the original article on Business Insider HBO's \"The Last of Us\" with Pedro Pascal and Kaitlyn Dever is one of the biggest shows on TV.Liane Hentscher/HBOThe streaming wars aren't the same cutthroat competition they used to be.Media giants like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros.

Take a look back at Meghan's career, from her odd jobs to her starring roles.Meghan Markle's early careerMeghan began working when she was 13, holding a part-time job at a frozen yogurt shop called Humphrey Yogart in 1995.Paula Sheftel, Meghan's boss at the store, told the Mirror in 2017 that she was \"very popular with customers\" during her tenure.Meghan studied acting and international relations at Northwestern University. While still in school, she did a six-week internship at the American embassy in Argentina.According to her IMDb page, Meghan began pursuing a career in acting even before she graduated in 2003. Her first official role was Nurse Jill on \"General Hospital\" in 2002, and she went on to book a series of smaller roles in shows like \"CSI,\" \"Knight Rider,\" and \"90210\" over the next eight years.Meghan Markle made an appearance on \"General Hospital.\"ABCMeghan also worked as a briefcase girl on \"Deal or No Deal\" between 2006 and 2007 and appeared in a \"Tostitos\" commercial in 2009.She landed a few small film roles, including as a bartender in the 2010 movie \"Remember Me,\" which her first husband, Trevor Engelson, produced, and as Jamie in \"Horrible Bosses\" in 2011.In addition, Meghan had odd jobs as she built up her acting career, including working as a hostess at an unnamed restaurant, as she told Vanity Fair in 2017.She also worked as a part-time calligrapher, a gig she described as \"super lucrative\" in a 2018 interview with Esquire. She told the outlet her calligraphy work included Dolce & Gabbana's holiday correspondence and the invitations for Paula Patton and Robin Thicke's 2005 wedding.Meghan's breakout acting role on 'Suits'Meghan landed her breakout acting role when she was cast as Rachel Zane in \"Suits\" in 2011. Her character started as a paralegal in the legal drama and became a lawyer, and she had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Michael Ross in the series.Meghan filmed \"Suits\" from 2011 to 2017; her final episode aired in April 2018. She became a household name through the show. She also lived in Toronto while on the series, as it was filmed in Canada.Meghan met Prince Harry when she was starring on \"Suits.\"Meghan Markle played paralegal-turned-lawyer Rachel Zane in \"Suits.\"USA NetworkAlthough her acting career was hitting its peak on \"Suits,\" Meghan also had a side hustle while on the show. She started her blog The Tig in 2014 and ran it until 2017. The lifestyle blog featured travel content, recipes, and interviews with Meghan's famous friends.She also channeled her off-screen time into service work, becoming a United Nations women's advocate in 2015 and a World Vision ambassador in 2016.Meghan left \"Suits\" after announcing her engagement to Harry in November 2017, preparing to become a working royal. USA Network and Universal Cable Productions confirmed her departure in a statement at the time, saying they wanted \"to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement.\"\"Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years, and it has been a joy to work with her,\" the statement said. \"We want to thank her for her undeniable passion and dedication to 'Suits,' and we wish her the very best.\"Post-royal ventures with Prince HarryMeghan became a working royal after she and Harry got married in May 2018, attending royal engagements and taking on patronages on behalf of the crown. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in January 2020, and they wrapped up their royal duties in March of the same year.Meghan and Harry launched their post-royal careers in the summer of 2020. In August 2020, they signed a reported $100 million production deal with Netflix to produce both non-scripted and scripted series for the streamer and a $20 million deal with Spotify to make podcasts in December of that year.They also created Archewell Inc. in October 2020, which would serve as the umbrella organization for their production and charitable ventures.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had a Netflix docuseries called \"Harry & Meghan.\"NetflixIn 2021, Meghan became an author, publishing the children's book \"The Bench\" in June, and she launched her Spotify podcast \"Archetypes\" in August. Both ventures were immediate successes; \"The Bench\" became a New York Times bestseller, and \"Archetypes\" dethroned Joe Rogan's podcast to reach the No. 1 spot on Spotify when it premiered. The popularity of \"Archetypes\" waned, though, and Harry and Meghan's relationship with Spotify ended in 2023.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's first Netflix series, \"Harry & Meghan,\" was a docuseries about their relationship and step back as senior royals. It was a huge hit when it premiered in December 2022, though the couple didn't build on that momentum until 2025.Meghan's lifestyle eraOn March 4, 2025, Netflix released \"With Love, Meghan,\" a lifestyle series that builds on Meghan's passions from her blogging days. The show was initially set to premiere in January, but Meghan delayed its release amid the LA wildfires.Season one explored Meghan's recipes, hosting hacks, and gardening tips. A different celebrity guest starred on each episode of the show, offering a mix of interactions with Meghan and her friends and industry experts like Roy Choi.When it debuted, the show hit Netflix's top 10. On March 7, the streamer announced that season two of \"With Love, Meghan\" had already wrapped filming and would air sometime in the fall.Meghan Markle returned to Netflix with her series \"With Love, Meghan.\"NetflixIn February 2025, Meghan also revealed she would launch a lifestyle brand, As Ever, in conjunction with the show, unveiling a new website and Instagram page the same day.The company was originally announced in March 2024 as American Riviera Orchard, a nod to a common nickname for her neighborhood of Santa Barbara. Meghan shared an Instagram account and website for the company and teased its first product, strawberry jam, by sending jars of it to her famous friends.However, in August 2024, Meghan's trademark application for the brand was denied because the name was \"primarily geographically descriptive.\" In February 2025, she announced in an Instagram video that she had rebranded the company to As Ever and that Netflix had joined the company as her business partner. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)The first As Ever products, including a raspberry spread, wildflower honey, flower sprinkles, a crepe mix, a shortbread cookie mix, and three types of tea, dropped on April 2.

        "description": "The vertical video feed is coming to the Netflix app. The streaming service announced Tuesday that in the coming weeks it will pilot the new feature, which it will populate with short-form clips of movies and shows tailored to the end-user’s viewing habits. Netflix users will be able to swipe through the feed to watch, save, or share content with friends, just like Tiktok. Yep the user interface that took over social media is making its way into streaming—but most importantly for Netflix, it’s a play for improving its own content discovery engine. “We know that swiping through a vertical feed on social media apps is an easy way to browse video content, and we also know that our members love to browse our clips and trailers to find their next obsession, so in the coming weeks we’ll be testing a vertical feed filled with clips of Netflix shows and movies to make discovery easy and fun,” Netflix’s chief product officer Eunice Kim said during a virtual presentation. [Image: Netflix] During this mobile-only test, the vertical video feed won’t be available to every single member, Netflix tells Fast Company, but those who get it will see recommendations personalized to them, with feature clips from their “top picks for you.” Netflix previously tried vertical-video feeds in 2021 with two themed apps, Fast Laughs for comedy clips and Kids Clips for clips from its children’s programming, but it’s forthcoming in-app pilot expands on that concept across the streamer’s library. The announcement was one of a number of design changes Netflix announced Tuesday, including a new “My Netflix” tab with listed content, reminders for upcoming shows, and a continue watching feed, as well as a homepage designed to show more information at a glance, including callouts like “New Episode,” “Recently Added,” “Oscar Winner,” and “We think you’ll love this” that appear with their own emoji-style icons next to shows. The company is also considering expanding into video podcasts. But it’s the vertical video feed that seems aimed at killing two birds with one stone. [Image: Netflix] Netflix head of design Steve Johnson told Fast Company last year that the two things that keep him up at night are discovery and competition for viewing time from a generation that spends a majority of its viewing hours on mobile devices. By piloting its own short-form, vertical video feed, Netflix is trying to both improve discovery and carve out more viewing time on its app with a swiping experience borrowed from social media. Already, TikTok’s social media competitors like Instagram have made design changes that mirror its vertical video layout, and that trend is now creeping into other app categories. (Tubi launched its own TikTok-ified discovery format, called “Scenes,” last fall.) As TikTok became more popular, full-length, professionally shot shows had to compete with more and more short-form video content, and even with amateur, recorded snippets of their own IP popping up in social feeds. Now, Netflix is trying to meet viewers where they are, with a few potential benefits. By offering viewers shareable clips of its own shows, Netflix has a say in how its content appears on other platforms, while still taking advantage of the soft marketing of user-generated fandom. And if cutting up its shows into bite-size videos and organizing them in a format familiar to social media natives provides Netflix a better discovery funnel for new shows, the format could soon find other closed platform imitators.",

In the episode, Rogen's beleaguered studio head Matt Remick attends the Golden Globes, where a film he greenlit is nominated.

        "description": "Stock prices for Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery fell this morning after President Trump took to social media to warn of major incoming tariffs for films made overseas. This Sunday, Trump used Truth Social to announce another escalation of his ongoing trade war. In the post, Trump claimed that America’s movie industry is dying “a very fast death,” as “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away.” The president went on to call this rise of foreign production both “propaganda” and a national security threat, ending by stating that, “I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Howard Lutnick, the U.S. commerce secretary, responded to Trump’s rant with the brief note posted to X: “We’re on it.” Neither Trump nor Lutnick provided any clarification on how such a tariff would be applied, or who might be affected. But this morning, production and streaming companies are already feeling the impact of Trump’s proposed plan: Shares for Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount Global took a sharp decline in early Monday trading, although Disney has since quickly bounced back. A potential industry-wide “chilling effect” So far, Trump’s announcement has left media experts scratching their heads—and incited its fair share of backlash. First, it’s difficult to parse how an 100% tariff on movies “produced in foreign lands” would actually be implemented. Experts have noted that it’s unclear whether this tariff would apply only to foreign-language films imported to the United States or to any production shot overseas, including those led by major U.S. studios. It’s also not apparent whether this move will affect streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, which host plenty of titles that are either fully foreign-made or produced in part in another country, and whether short-form content like TV shows will also be impacted. “So many questions,” Simon Pulman, an entertainment lawyer at Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn. “Who is ultimately charged the tariff, and on what basis? Production spend? Distributor gross? Do you seek to hit the distributors and platforms that exhibit foreign-produced content? What about Netflix, whose titles do not generate direct revenue? What happens if production occurs offshore but post happens in the US? What about cross-border productions?” It’s true that producers are filming more overseas In an interview with Fast Company, Pulman said that while the implementation of Trump’s proposed plan is unknown, its main goal appears to be convincing major movie studios to bring production back to the U.S. In the wake of Hollywood’s 2023 writer and actor strikes, it’s become more common for major Hollywood films (Gladiator II, the soon-to-be-released Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, and several upcoming Avengers films, for example) to be produced at least partly overseas. That’s because, Pulman says, the strikes caused many production companies to reevaluate costs, while, simultaneously, foreign jurisdictions like the U.K., Hungary, and the Czech Republic began instating “aggressive tax incentives” for producers. Already, politicians and executives from Australia, New Zealand, France, and Italy have spoken out against Trump’s plan. According to the nonprofit media tracker FilmLA, film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the past decade. Given this offshoring trend, Pulman says, the idea of re-incentivizing production in the U.S. is laudable to some extent. But he thinks adding major tariffs to overseas production is more likely to both increase domestic ticket prices and decrease the number of movies being made rather than convincing American filmmakers to shoot in the U.S. “To my knowledge, every jurisdiction, whether it’s a state in the U.S. or a country like France or Canada, they don’t achieve [more production] by penalizing companies that go offshore,” Pulman says. “They try to attract and incentivize companies to shoot in their jurisdictions by offering various benefits to them.” The worst kind of Hollywood cliffhanger At this point, Pulman adds, it’s difficult to predict exactly how production companies will react to Trump’s announcement—but he believes it’s most likely to have a “chilling effect” on the industry. “The reality is, until we know the details, and until there’s actually some kind of plan here, we’re not going to have a true sense of what this means,” Pulman says. “But the challenge with that is it creates uncertainty. If you’re a major streamer or a major studio, you’ve got this potentially hanging over your head.”",

Here are some of the biggest moves:Netflix down 6.2%Paramount Global down 3.1%Walt Disney Co down 3.6%Fox Corporation: down 2.1%Warner Bros. Discovery: down 3.3%Why: Investors sold shares of some of the top streamers and movie companies as President Donald Trump said he would instruct the Commerce Department to institute a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies.In a post on Truth Social, Trump suggested that tax incentives offered by other nations were drawing filmmakers away from the US, which he referred to as a \"National Security threat.\"\"The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,\" Trump wrote. \"WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!\" he later added.What it means: US production companies film overseas for various reasons, including tax incentives offered by other countries to attract filmmakers. The tariff could represent a steep cost for an industry that had otherwise been out of the crosshairs of the trade war.The potential film tariff is also another indication that Trump is escalating his trade war, despite the White House reporting progress on trade negotiations with other countries.The development is coming after a strong quarter for top film stocks. Netflix and Disney both posted earnings and revenue beats over the first quarter, sending the share prices of each stock higher.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The 47-year-old multimillionaire has already applied his slogan “Don’t Die” to events, merchandise, and a Netflix documentary. Now he’s founding a Don’t Die religion. Johnson, who famously spends millions of dollars on scans, tests, supplements, and a lifestyle routine designed to slow or reverse the aging process, has enjoyed extensive media coverage, and a huge social media following. For many people, he has become the face of the longevity field. I sat down with Johnson at an event for people interested in longevity in Berkeley, California, in late April. We spoke on the sidelines after lunch (conference plastic-lidded container meal for me; what seemed to be a plastic-free, compostable box of chicken and vegetables for him), and he sat with an impeccable posture, his expression neutral. Earlier that morning, Johnson, in worn trainers and the kind of hoodie that is almost certainly deceptively expensive, had told the audience about what he saw as the end of humanity. Specifically, he was worried about AI—that we face an “event horizon,” a point at which superintelligent AI escapes human understanding and control. He had come to Berkeley to persuade people who are interested in longevity to focus their efforts on AI. It is this particular concern that ultimately underpins his Don’t Die mission. First, humans must embrace the Don’t Die ideology. Then we must ensure AI is aligned with preserving human existence. Were it not for AI, he says, he wouldn’t be doing any of his anti-death activities and regimens. “I am convinced that we are at an existential moment as a species,” says Johnson, who was raised Mormon but has since left the church. Solving aging will take decades, he says—we’ll survive that long only if we make sure that AI is aligned with human survival. The following Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Why are you creating a new religion? We’re in this new phase where [because of advances in AI] we’re trying to reimagine what it means to be human. It requires imagination and creativity and open-mindedness, and that’s a big ask. Approaching that conversation as a community, or a lifestyle, doesn’t carry enough weight or power. Religions have proven, over the past several thousand years, to be the most efficacious form to organize human efforts. It’s just a tried-and-true methodology. How do you go about founding a new religion? It’s a good question. If you look at historical [examples], Buddha went through his own self-exploratory process and came up with a framework. And Muhammad had a story. Jesus had an origin story … You might even say Satoshi [Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin] is like [the founder of] a modern-day religion, [launched] with the white paper. Adam Smith launched capitalism with his book. The question is: What is a modern-day religion, and how does it convince? It’s an open question for me. I don’t know yet. Your goal is to align AI with Don’t Die—or, in other words, ensure that AI models prioritize and protect human life. How will you do that? I’m talking to a lot of AI researchers about this. Communities of AIs could be instilled with values of conflict resolution that do not end in the death of a human. Or an AI. Or the planet. Would you say that Don’t Die is “your” religion? No, I think it’s humanity’s religion. It’s different from other religions, which are very founder-centric. I think this is going to be decentralized, and it will be something that everybody can make their own. So there’s no God? We’re playing with the idea that the body is God. We’ve been experimenting with this format of a Don’t Die fam, where eight to 12 people get together on a weekly basis. It’s patterned off of other groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. We structure an opening ritual. We have a mantra. And then there’s a part where people apologize to their body for something they’ve done that has inflicted harm upon themselves. It’s reframing our relationship to body and to mind. It is also a way for people to have deep friendships, to explore emotionally vulnerable topics, and to support each other in health practices. What we’re really trying to say is: Existence is the virtue. Existence is the objective. If someone believes in God, that’s fine. People can be Christian and do this; they can be Muslim and do this. Don’t Die is a “yes, and” to all groups. So it’s a different way of thinking about religion? Yeah. Right now, religion doesn’t hold the highest status in society. A lot of people look down on it in some way. I think as AI progresses, it’s going to create additional questions on who we are: What is our identity? What do we believe about our existence in the future? People are going to want some kind of framework that helps them make sense of the moment. So I think there’s going to be a shift toward religion in the coming years. People might say that [founding a religion now] is kind of a weird move, and that [religion] turns people off. But I think that’s fine. I think we’re ahead. Does the religion incorporate, or make reference to, AI in any way? Yeah. AI is going to be omnipresent. And this is why we’ve been contemplating “the body is God.” Over the past couple of years … I’ve been testing the hypothesis that if I get a whole bunch of data about my body, and I give it to an algorithm, and feed that algorithm updates with scientific evidence, then it would eventually do a better job than a doctor. So I gave myself over to an algorithm. It really is in my best interest to let it tell me what to eat, tell me when to sleep and exercise, because it would do a better job of making me happy. Instead of my mind haphazardly deciding what it wants to eat based on how it feels in the moment, the body is elevated to a position of authority. AI is going to be omnipresent and built into our everyday activities. Just like it autocompletes our texts, it will be able to autocomplete our thoughts. Might some people interpret that as AI being God? Potentially. I would be hesitant to try to define [someone else’s] God. The thing we want to align upon is that none of us want to die right now. We’re attempting to make Don’t Die the world’s most influential ideology in the next 18 months.",

        "description": "When Formula 1 superstar Lewis Hamilton announced in December that he would be leaving the Mercedes team for Ferrari after 246 Grands Prix, 84 victories, and 6 drivers’ championships in 12 seasons, much of the focus was on Hamilton’s future plans. Just as compelling was the empty seat Hamilton was leaving at Mercedes. His departure triggered an intense internal process for the automaker—the search for a successor. Many of the discussions and debates that resulted in Mercedes choosing young Italian driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli played out over messaging app WhatsApp. That process is now the subject of a new one-hour documentary on Netflix called The Seat, dropping on May 5. Directed by Kyle Thrash, and produced by RadicalMedia, it’s also a WhatsApp commercial. The Meta-owned app is a producer, and created the project with its content partner Modern Arts. WhatsApp’s global head of marketing, Vivian Odior, says the company decided to create the doc in order to fully show how the app is often part of critical inflection points in its users’ lives. “When it comes to telling those stories, we believe in giving the space to properly unpack the role we play and share the full story of our user base,” says Odior. “We don’t believe we should be limited by ad formats. Storytelling allows us to occupy a unique position in the hearts of users and pushes beyond the functional role we play.” This isn’t some ad-tiered piece of content. It’s a legitimate addition to the streamer’s F1 library. Many marketers will be shaking with jealousy or excitement, inspired to make their own move into entertainment. But be forewarned, creating content that can go head-to-head with other films and TV is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for those searching for a formula. Even WhatsApp knows this is a unique brand opportunity. Make your own luck WhatsApp has long been a brand partner to the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team, and last year Modern Arts created a short film on Hamilton called Push Push. It chronicled the ups and downs of his racing career, as well as his personal struggles with dyslexia and bullying, woven into a conversation he has with a group of teens today about their own lives. That helped build the relationship and trust with Mercedes to make The Seat possible. Modern Arts has a track record of telling compelling stories around the platform, like its award-winning, 26-minute doc We Are Ayenda, about WhatsApp’s role in helping the Afghanistan Women’s Youth National Football Team escape the Taliban. Zac Ryder, the agency’s cofounder and co-chief creative officer, says that made it a lot easier to start figuring out a story to be told around privacy with the Mercedes team. “It just so happens that not only is WhatsApp a sponsor of the team, but the entire Mercedes team literally runs on WhatsApp,” Ryder says. “You very rarely ever send an email. It’s all done on WhatsApp. They have hundreds of WhatsApp groups, and that’s how their entire team is organized, from little details around traveling to big things like engineering and car designs. It’s all shared across WhatsApp.” In theory, this sounds like a formula for the greatest product demo video ever made. But Formula 1 teams are known to be about as forthcoming with secrets as the Pentagon. Ryder says Mercedes saw the value in giving the film access to its internal process, with the goal of helping F1 fans fall in love with Antonelli, a relatively unknown 18-year-old driver. For WhatsApp, the goal was to tell a privacy story by showing how well it functions in high-stakes situations. “Our job was to figure out how those two things can coexist to make something that was going to be compelling,” Ryder says. No one formula It’s a unique situation for a brand to have its product at the center of a major sports story. Ryder says the strategy quickly became to make the project revolve around trust. The Mercedes team was trusting its F1 driver’s seat to Antonelli, but in the process it was also showing its trust in WhatsApp as a communications platform. In a typical commercial edit, marketers will obsess over how many times the product is mentioned, or the product appears, or the logo is flashed. Modern Arts CEO Brooke Stites says the film is not about that because the brand and its product are so intertwined with the story itself. As a marketing investment, Stites says the film cost about as much as it would to make and buy ad time for a 60-second commercial. Here, the entire budget went into the production because being on Netflix means there isn’t the need to pay for advertising space on TV and online. “It’s a totally different model,” says Stites. “It’s not cheap, but it’s what you’re going to spend on a 60-second spot that you then have to spend 10 times more to buy places that force people to watch it. Everyone who watches F1 content on Netflix is going to get served our film.” The Seat is not a paid advertising arrangement with Netflix; it was acquired by the streamer in the same way other film and television content is acquired. Other major streamers were vying for the film, but Netflix’s connection to the long-running docuseries Formula 1: Drive to Survive made it the ideal home. For some time brands and ad agencies have been putting “make a film for Netflix” in their marketing briefs, but the reality is, it’s not that simple. Stites says there are some critical ingredients a project needs in order to get anywhere near Netflix or any other top-tier streamer. “You have to have an amazing story and quality of craft,” she says. “All these streamers are looking at it and asking, ‘Is this something that’s adding value to my audience? Is this something that my viewers are going to actually want to engage with?’ That was a big part of the F1 piece.” For other brands interested in this type of storytelling, Stites has a piece of advice: Tell a compelling story that involves your brand, don’t just tell your brand story. Every brand wants to tap into culture. To tell stories people really want to hear, you need to find the stories in culture that authentically include your brand instead of trying to force-feed your brand into culture. “We’re not telling a story about WhatsApp. It’s not about the brand,” says Stites. “Stories involving brands already exist in culture that are really actually very interesting, and people are willing and wanting to engage with them. Tell a story that people are going to care about, versus starting from a place of ‘Let’s tell a brand story.’”",

        "description": "According to the Sandvine report, YouTube was the top source of traffic in 2024, with 16% of total internet traffic coming from it. YouTube even surpassed Netflix in fixed-internet download traffic which was 12% of the total internet traffic in 2024. It's been 20 years since the release of YouTube and it spent a journey with amature videos and copyright issues and now it is home to a lot of content creators who got famous through it.YouTube also had 21% of the total traffic on mobile in 2024, and outperformed many social media apps and paid streaming apps. Facebook (18%) had the most mobile internet traffic in 2024, followed by TikTok (15%) and Instagram (7%). YouTube has all kinds of video lengths, from short to medium to long, so it makes this easier for YouTube to compete with other social media and streaming apps, and people can use it anytime, anywhere. Even though TikTok and Facebook are behind YouTube and Netflix on fixed internet connections, they are still ahead of Disney+ and Amazon Prime. 39% of the fixed global download traffic in 2024 was taken up by video apps, which was followed by social media (18%) and television (11%). 28% of the fixed upload traffic in 2023 in the US was by file sharing services like FaceTime, iCloud, and Google Cloud, while Facebook Messenger, TikTok, and Snapchat took the most upload traffic on mobile. Other points to note are that YouTube used to lag behind Netflix in 2018, but it overtook Netflix in 2022. Right now, Facebook has the most users globally and it is followed by 2.5 billion users on YouTube. YouTube’s success is mostly because it's a free app, but the creative, unique, and real content on it also makes it loved among users. The only dark side of YouTube is that, as it's home to many subcultures, it can create many controversies, and users can also find themselves going through a lot of misinformation.

Everything is going well for the now-married power couple, but Joe's dark side can only be suppressed for so long, and once it reemerges and reinvigorates him, their relationship becomes fraught.Ritchie told Business Insider that Kate has known all along that this is who Joe is — she's just been in denial about it. This season is \"a real lesson in accepting the reality of your situation,\" Ritchie said.When Kate finally sees clearly, she decides that the only way to stop Joe is to kill him.\"She is genuinely afraid of him and what he can do,\" Ritchie explained. \"I think she just sees how this man consistently gets away with everything, and she's like, 'He has to not exist anymore for us to be safe. There's no system in the world that could keep him from us.'\"Charlotte Ritchie as Kate Lockwood and Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg in season five, episode five of \"You.\"NetflixKate recruits Joe's season three love interest Marienne Bellamy (Tati Gabrielle) and season four character Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman) to help her. This is one way the final season weaves together loose ends from the series and provides closure for other fan-favorite characters.\"What I love about this series is that they really lean into the genre. They really lean into the history of the show,\" Ritchie said. \"I think it does the whole narrative justice.\"In one dramatic moment in the penultimate episode, after getting into a physical altercation, Kate and Joe end up on the floor of Mooney's basement as the bookstore goes up in flames.Resigned and more truthful than ever and thinking they've both reached their end, Joe admits that he killed Kate's dad and murdered Love. Relieved, Kate reveals that she secretly recorded Joe's confession and will be sending it to the authorities.\"You got me,\" Joe says. \"You can die happy.\"It's a scene that, like many in the show, finds the humor in unconventional moments.\"I love that that's in there, just Kate and Joe both quite dryly commenting on how absurd it is and how sad that they're both going to die,\" Ritchie said. \"I just think it's a great scene. I think it's really well written.\"Ritchie as Kate and Badgley as Joe in season five, episode nine of \"You.\"NetflixNeither Kate nor Joe dies in that moment, and Ritchie has complicated feelings about her character escaping the fire.\"I was so happy because I've grown to really love this character, and I found it was so fun to get to be right in the midst of getting him,\" Ritchie said. \"But I also felt like if there's ever a poetic justice in death, there was some justice in Kate going down with him.\"\"I really don't believe in people dying because they've done bad things, but in the world of the justice of this show, there's such a redemptive element to Kate's demise that it would've been OK,\" she added.With Joe locked up for life in the finale, Ritchie said she's happy that Henry has a consistent and stable parent. But still, Kate's not innocent.\"She's done some pretty dastardly things and she's got herself into scrapes and been responsible for a lot of people's downfalls,\" Ritche said. \"So yeah, I was on the fence as to what should happen to her, but I was obviously really pleased that she comes through.\"Ritchie as Kate in the season five finale of \"You.\"Clifton Prescod/Netflix\"You\" co-showrunners Michael Foley and Justin W. Lo previously told BI that they are prepared for fans to have varying reactions to Joe's fate in the finale and their choice to put him behind bars. Ritchie, too, is still grappling with that conclusion.\"I feel so mixed about it,\" she said.After multiple seasons of seeing Joe do terrible, gruesome things, she's not sure what ending could adequately bookend his story.\"There is no fate that matches a life like that,\" Ritchie said. \"But I do feel like the isolation is a good punishment for him. The thing is, I just don't get any sense that he's going to reflect or grow. It's not going to be a formative or spiritual experience for him. Broadly, it isn't for people. As far as I can tell, solitary confinement just seems to wear people down, except for some kind of amazing exceptions.\"Case in point: in the final scene, Joe reads a creepy fan letter and says that maybe the problem isn't him — perhaps it's society.\"I do find the letter-writing thing quite an interesting twist, and his ability to turn it back onto his admirers and these women who have been asking to be involved with him,\" Ritchie said. \"He'll never accept responsibility.\"Badgley as Joe in the season five finale of \"You.\"Clifton Prescod/NetflixAs the press tour for season five winds down, Ritchie already misses the cast and crew, including her frequent scene partner Badgley.\"I love Penn,\" Ritchie said. \"I think he's such a decent and thoughtful and committed actor. He's such a lovely friend. He's very funny. And he commits to that role in a way that means that when you are working with him, you can do the same.\"After seeing Kate go from closed-off and cold to blossoming in the final season, Ritchie is going to miss exploring more sides of her.\"And I'll miss the outrageous scenarios that are constant. Like, the nonstop drama, the daily, different high-octane situations where people are constantly about to extort somebody or about to kill somebody,\" she said. \"That kind of level of high drama, I'll miss.\"Season five of \"You\" is now streaming on Netflix.Read the original article on Business Insider Charlotte Ritchie as Kate Lockwood in season five, episode four of \"You.\"Netflix\"You\" star Charlotte Ritchie, who plays Kate Lockwood, spoke to BI about the fifth and final season.Ritchie reacted to Kate's fate and said she was \"on the fence\" about what should happen to her.The actor also gave her opinion on how Joe's story ends.Warning: Major spoilers ahead for season five of Netflix's \"You.\"The final chapter of Netflix's hit series \"You\" has arrived, and star Charlotte Ritchie is (mostly) thrilled that her character, Kate Lockwood, made it out alive.The fifth season of \"You,\" released on Thursday, picks up three years after Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) and Kate move back to his hometown of New York City at the end of season four.

Multiple studies and investigations have found that about half of American households watch TV and movies with subtitles on, but only a relatively small portion of those include someone with a hearing disability. That's because of the trouble many people have understanding dialogue in modern viewing situations, and Netflix has now introduced a subtitles option to help. The closed captioning we've all been using for years includes not only the words the people on-screen are saying, but additional information needed by the hard of hearing, including character names, music cues (\"dramatic music intensifies\") and sound effects (\"loud explosion\"). For those who just wanted to make sure they didn't miss a word here and there, the frequent descriptions of sound effects and music could be distracting. This new format omits those extras, just including the spoken words and nothing else—even in the same language as the spoken dialogue.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Madeline Brewer as Bronte and Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg in season five, episode three of \"You.\"NetflixThe fifth and final season of \"You,\" starring Penn Badgley, is now streaming on Netflix.Co-showrunners Michael Foley and Justin W. Lo spoke to BI about giving fans a satisfying ending.Foley said that Badlgey wanted fans to see Joe at his \"most horrific\" in the finale.Warning: Major spoilers ahead for season five of Netflix's \"You.\"Joe Goldberg got the ending that he's long deserved.Netflix's hit thriller series \"You,\" which stars Penn Badgley as Joe, a romantic at heart with a penchant for repeatedly murdering in the name of love, released its final season on Thursday.The 10-episode fifth season is a culmination of years of Joe narrowly escaping real consequences for his actions. But now, he's finally locked up for good thanks to the efforts of a new character named Louise Flannery (Madeline Brewer), a woman who dupes Joe into falling in love with her through a carefully curated persona known as Bronte.In a spoiler-filled discussion with Business Insider, co-showrunners, executive producers, and writers Michael Foley and Justin W. Lo explained Joe's fate and why death would be \"too easy\" a conclusion, why Badgley wanted audiences to see Joe at his \"most horrific\" in the bloody finale, and the \"cheeky\" way the last scene winks at fans' complicity.Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg in season five of \"You.\"Clifton Prescod/NetflixBusiness Insider: Penn Badgley has lived with this character for so many years. Was there anything specific that he brought to the final season in terms of giving suggestions for lines or moments? How closely did you work with him?Michael Foley: Penn always gets an early draft and gives us his thoughts and sometimes jumps on the phone with us. He's very communicative on set in prep about the episode that he's filming. Obviously, he has such a great handle on his character that it is really just about honing in on things.But in this final season, the goal, as you hopefully witnessed in the finale, was that we see Joe Goldberg at his worst. And that was really important to Penn, that he was at his most horrific. He wanted to help us in our mission to have everybody stop and see him be so horrific that we all have to question what we just co-signed for all this time and sort of burst the delusion that he's a rootable hero.So, that was really important to him. That's why he's in his boxers in the rain and that's why he's punching a woman for the first time. We usually cut away from the violence. We just wanted it to get really nasty and awful. And he was very much leading the charge in that regard. He's like, do not pull punches with this guy. I want him in the end to just be a monster.Episode seven is when people finally start turning on him a bit, and we see characters from his past come out of the woodwork, like Annika, Ethan, and Paco. Who else was on your bucket list of people that you wanted to bring back, but it didn't work out?Justin W. Lo: I'm trying to think who else we wanted. I think we got mostly everyone we wanted to be in that montage. We did this thing in the writer's room where we put a list of people who would be pro-Joe, against Joe, and sort of neutral, and then we brainstormed what they would be saying about him. One of our favorites was Paco, of course, because Paco is pro-Joe, but what he says ends up screwing Joe over in a major way. So, that was one of our favorite discoveries.I was surprised not to see Jenna Ortega's character, Ellie. I feel like she would've been such a fun fit in there. Was she one of the people that you tried to get?Foley: That was complicated by the fact that she's doing \"Wednesday\" in Ireland and it just seemed like a non-starter. We just couldn't figure out a way to make it work.If Ellie was in that montage, what side would she have been on?Lo: Oh, pro-Joe [laughs]. Well, I think... hmm. It's a good question. It could have gone either way. You could make an argument for pro-Joe, because he was there for her during a very difficult time in her life. But you could also say, I think Ellie's very smart and she probably knows that he had something to do with her sister's death, even though it was Love. So she could have turned against him as well.Who came up with the idea for Bronte to shoot Joe in the penis, and what does that add to the punishment that Joe deservedly got in the final season?Lo: Greg Berlanti came up with the idea for the dick shot, and it was symbolic. Everybody, Penn, the showrunners, Greg, Sera [Gamble], we all wanted to make sure that Joe was taken down and no longer a romantic or sexual icon. And so that is the best way to do that. Couldn't get more pointed than that.Madeline Brewer as Bronte and Badgley as Joe Goldberg in season five of \"You.\"Clifton Prescod/NetflixIn that moment when Bronte pulls the gun on him and he begs her to kill him, was he genuinely OK with dying at her hands in that moment, or was he just bluffing?Foley: She's suggesting that he's going to have to face what he really is, and that means he's going to sit in a courtroom, he's going to hear testimony of people who lost loved ones to Joe Goldberg, and that would break the delusion that he's a white knight and a good guy, and he couldn't handle that. So he was actually in that moment choosing death and hoping for death. And both Louise and we, the writers, thought that death was too easy, that we needed to put him in a veritable cage, and he needed to live on without knowing the feeling of a lover's touch, without his freedom, et cetera.How long has that been the game plan for Joe, him ending up in prison with loneliness being his ultimate form of punishment?Foley: The specifics of it, in terms of him being in prison and living, were things that we worked out pretty late in the final season.But in terms of him A) not getting away with it, B) not being redeemed, C) facing loved ones or people who he wronged, all of that was known early on, going into the season, if not a season or two earlier. We just didn't know the actual shape it would take.What was the conversation like with Penn when you mapped out the specifics of that final scene and his ending?Foley: There's a single line that Louise says to him, which is that \"the fantasy of a man like you is how we cope with the reality of a man like you.\" That's the most important line this season for us, if not in the series, and he was a big fan of that line. He liked that it was the closest we were going to come to just sort of really stating our message, if you will. So yeah, we were all completely on the same page about Joe's condemnation, Joe's end.Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg in the series finale of \"You.\"NetflixIn the final scene, Joe's reading a creepy letter and he's still delusional and putting the blame on other people. It kind of felt like a little nod to the fans who thirsted over Joe this whole time, despite him being a murderer. What was the message you were trying to convey in that scene?Lo: We were trying to convey that Joe will never take responsibility for anything that he's done, that he always has to blame someone, and in this case, it's society, and he's speaking to us.It's a cheeky way to show that we have been complicit and he's turning against us in this one moment. We have been with him, in his voiceover part of his thought processes, in the whole series. And in this moment, he turns against us and blames us, the society, for creating him and for loving him.In the past, the female leads of the show have not fared well, but Louise, Kate, and Marienne all get their happy endings. Why was it important for the series to end with these women not being casualties?Foley: The entire run of the series, yes, there is Joe getting what Joe needs to get, in terms of killing for love. And then sometimes the killing can just seem bleak, and we want to entertain, and we don't want to lose our audience. And so it felt like with Kate, she had earned her absolution and her redemption, being willing to die by going back down to the basement to kill Joe. That's why we kept her alive, but it just didn't feel additive to kill. We don't want to kill people just for killing's sake.I would just say that Louise, in the end, keeping her alive was very important to us because we wanted the show to end with a woman's voice. Like, yes, we add this coda with Joe where he says, \"It's not my fault, it's yours.\" But the real ending of the show is a woman having a voice and having agency, and Louise walking out of that bookstore and saying, \"Joe Goldberg is not going to write my story. I'm going to define who I am.\" That was very important to us.Charlotte Ritchie as Kate Lockwood in season five, episode four of \"You.\"NetflixBeck is such an important part of this whole season, and it brings the show full circle. What was it like pitching that to Elizabeth Lail and getting her back for a couple of scenes?Lo: The Beck storyline always brings tears to my eyes because it is so deep. And I say that Beck really got a raw deal in season one and she didn't do anything to deserve what she got. And she has been that symbol of innocence that got marred this whole series, really.So, it felt fitting to be able to give her justice. And that's why I think that the connection to Bronte was so powerful. You can feel it all through the season as soon as we learn the connection between them in that fifth episode.[Elizabeth] loved it. She was so excited to be part of the final season and she loves this character, too. So it was very meaningful for her to be able to be such a big part of the end of Joe Goldberg's story.Do you think the show could have gone on for another season, or did it need to end with the fifth season?Foley: I think it would've started to get repetitive and we would've been going to this same well in many ways, narratively. I don't know a single person in the writer's room who felt like, \"Oh, if only we had one more season",

        "description": "Remember when Netflix cost $9 per month and The New York Times website was free? Well, the days of online media feeling like a bargain are long gone. Today, it’s become a costly convenience. But there are still great deals to be had, thanks to cheap yearlong introductory subscriptions, budget bundles, and libraries. One thing to skip: those one-month free trials that are easy to sign up for but even easier to forget to cancel. Here are some of the best ways to truly save on digital media. Free content with ads or from the library Free news sources include the Associated Press, the BBC, DW (Germany’s international broadcaster, available in English), The Free Press, The Guardian, and NPR. Many other sites offer a portion of their content free. You can also tap into free content newsletters and podcasts from typically paid sources such as Forbes, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. In fact, most podcasts are free to stream (though they may include ads), from Joe Rogan to Jon Stewart. Meanwhile, a library card can help you score a world of free media through apps. Libby provides e-books and audiobooks on phones, tablets, and the web. Hoopla has e-books, audiobooks, movies, TV shows, music, and comics, with apps for phones, tablets, and smart TVs. Your library may not have every title you want, or there may be a waitlist. But it’s a great place to start. For more TV and movies, skip Hulu and Netflix in favor of Amazon FreeVee, Pluto TV, the Roku Channel, and Tubi. They are ad-supported, but nowadays so is the basic tier of most paid services. If you can handle commercials every few songs, check out the free tiers of Deezer, SoundCloud, Spotify, and YouTube Music. Long-term introductory subscriptions Many news outlets offer steeply discounted introductory rates for digital and digital/print subscriptions. As of this writing, deals include: six months of The New York Times for $4 a month; a year of The Wall Street Journal for $8 a month; and The Washington Post for just $40 a year. The San Francisco Chronicle offered three months for 25 cents, and the Los Angeles Times had four months for a single dollar. (For even more options, check out DiscountMags.) At the end of the introductory period, newspapers may offer further discounts to keep you from canceling. Streaming deals change more often, so keep an eye out. They have included a year of Hulu at 99 cents per month or three free months of Peacock (both with ads). Spotify’s ad-free Premium plan is free for three months. Shared subscriptions You may save with a subscription that allows you to add one or more people at a discount, or even for free. For example: Two people can get one year of The Washington Post for $60. Depending on the plan, Netflix lets you add either one or two people at $6.99 a month for service with ads or $8.99 without. Spotify offers a dual ad-free subscription for $16.99 a month and a six-person family plan for $19.99 (versus $11.99 for one person), but everyone has to live at the same address. Amazon Family allows a Prime member to add one adult (related or not) and up to four children and four teens to share e-books and some other media for free. Apple Family Sharing allows up to six people to access much of what the first person subscribes to, such as AppleTV+, at no extra charge. Bundled subscriptions Savings on video bundles are often small, and may not help if the individual streamers are offering their own discounts. One to consider is the bundle of Hulu, Disney+, and Max (including HBO, Studio Ghibli, CNN, Food Network, The CW, and others) for $16.99 a month with ads or $29.99 without. For news, you can get Barron’s, The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, and Investor’s Business Daily at $16 a month for one year. For $12.99 a month, Apple News+ provides a selection of content from over 500 sources, including The Atlantic, Bon Appétit, National Geographic, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, and (ahem) Fast Company—all shareable with five other people. Look closely at bundles with wireless carriers. For instance, T-Mobile’s $85-a-month Experience More plan adds AppleTV+ and Netflix (with ads) for $35 more per line, per month than its Essentials Saver plan. But subscribing to both streamers on your own costs only $17.98. Experience More may be worthwhile for its additional wireless features, but not just for streaming. Buying a significant piece of Apple hardware (it varies by service) gets new users three free months of AppleTV+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Arcade. The company’s Apple One bundle starts with TV+, Music, Arcade, and 50GB of iCloud storage for $19.95 a month, versus $28.96 if bought separately. For $25.95, you can share all that, plus 200GB of storage, with five people. Throwing in Fitness+, News+, and 2TB raises the price to $37.95. Student, teacher, and military discounts The pricey Financial Times is free to pre-college students and their teachers at participating schools. Students and teachers can get a digital subscription to The Economist for 75% off. In addition, universities may offer free subscriptions to news outlets for students, faculty, and staff. Hulu offers students its ad-supported plan for $1.99 a month. Spotify bundles that plan plus its ad-free Premium service for $5.99. Apple charges the same for ad-free Music and (for a limited time) TV+. Peacock runs $2.99 (versus $7.99) for the first year. (The site Student Beans keeps track of deals on media subscriptions and many other items.) There are several options for military personnel, such as Peacock Premium at $3.99 a month for 12 months. Paramount+ offers a 50% discount for the life of any subscription plan. (Military discount sites The Exchange and GOVX list more deals.) You may be feeling overwhelmed by all these cheap and free offerings for all kinds of people and all kinds of media, but that’s better than being overwhelmed with big bills.",

Penn Badgley as Joe and Jenna Ortega as Ellie in season two of \"You.\"NetflixThe final season of Netflix's \"You\" brings back past characters for cameos in episode seven.Jenna Ortega's season two character Ellie Alves doesn't pop up in season five.The co-showrunners told BI that they were unable to make it work due to season two of \"Wednesday.\"Warning: Major spoilers ahead for season five of Netflix's \"You.\"Characters from seasons past return for the fifth and final installment of \"You\" — but there's one key character missing.After getting away with murder for four seasons, Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) is finally exposed for his crimes in season five.Episode seven, titled \"#JoeGoldberg,\" shows the public turning against Joe after an incriminating video taken seconds after he murdered Clayton (Tom Francis), the son of season one character Dr. Nicky Angevine (John Stamos), goes viral.Dominique (Natasha Behnam) and Phoenix (b), two internet vigilantes who livestreamed the shocking moment, continue their takedown of Joe in episode seven as they accuse him of being a serial killer and post videos discussing the evidence they've found from years of research.Suddenly, Joe becomes a hot topic in the news, with his name trending online and his face plastered across newspapers with headlines that question if he's a \"homicidal maniac.\"\"Leave it to social media to be my downfall,\" Joe says in the narration, as he scrolls through TikTok and sees people from his past sharing their thoughts on him.Dottie Quinn (Saffron Burrows), Annika Atwater (Kathryn Gallagher), Sherry Conrad (Shalita Grant) and Cary Conrad (Travis Van Winkle), Paco (Luca Padovan), and Ethan Russell (Zach Cherry) are among the characters who make cameos. But season two's Ellie Alves (Jenna Ortega), a social-media-savvy aspiring filmmaker, is noticeably absent.Ortega as Ellie on season two, episode one of \"You.\"NetflixIn a recent interview with Business Insider, season five co-showrunners Michael Foley and Justin W. Lo explained that Ortega's commitment to season two of the Netflix series \"Wednesday,\" in which she stars as Wednesday Addams, prevented her from reprising her role in \"You.\"\"That was complicated by the fact that she's doing 'Wednesday' in Ireland and it just seemed like a non-starter,\" Foley said. \"We just couldn't figure out a way to make it work.\"If Ortega was able to return to \"You,\" the storyline would have involved Ellie being a benefactor to Dominique and Phoenix. But ultimately, that storyline was scrapped.\"That was a thought that I'm sure when we were putting things together, we felt like maybe we could make this work, and we just simply couldn't,\" Foley said. Ortega joined \"You\" in season two, as Joe moved from New York to Los Angeles for a fresh start. Ellie, a 15-year-old cinephile who lived in the same apartment complex as Joe, was one of his closest acquaintances whom he was protective of.After Ellie's older sister, Delilah (Carmela Zumbado), is murdered by Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti), Ellie relocates to Florida using money that Joe gives her.Ortega as Ellie in season two of \"You.\"NetflixAlthough Ellie doesn't appear again in the show, Joe is shown still sending her money in season three, and he references her at the start of season four.Sera Gamble, the previous showrunner, told IndieWire in 2023 that there was a desire to bring Ortega back for season four, but she was committed to season one of \"Wednesday.\"If Ellie did come out of the woodwork to share her opinion online in season five, Lo said that perhaps the character would voice her support of Joe, or maybe she'd have a completely different opinion in the time that's passed.\"You could make an argument for pro-Joe because he was there for her during a very difficult time in her life,\" Lo said. \"But you could also say, I think Ellie's very smart and she probably knows that he had something to do with her sister's death, even though it was Love.

Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos on Wednesday (April 23) laid out the streaming giant’s vision for growth, which includes plans to diversify beyond online streaming as well as continuing to grow in its core business. At the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025, Sarandos was asked how Netflix plans to achieve its goal of becoming a trillion-dollar company, which seems hard to reach unless they expand beyond streaming. Sarandos first doubled down on opportunities in its core business. He said Netflix captures only about 5% of consumer spending and 10% of total TV watching time in its most mature markets. As such, there is “enormous room to grow just in the things that we do,” Sarandos said. In the previous five years, Netflix has doubled its revenue, increased profits tenfold and tripled its market capitalization, according to Sarandos. “So there is a path to (a trillion-dollar market cap), obviously, but it all is incredibly dependent on executing well,” Sarandos said. Nevertheless, Netflix is also exploring additional revenue streams by creating non-streaming experiences of their most popular shows. Creating Experiences This week, Netflix debuted “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” on Broadway, which is based on the hit show “Stranger Things.” Sarandos describes the play as “part Broadway show, part thrill ride” that tells the origin story of its popular series. The “Stranger Things” franchise has also spawned consumer products, including “Surfer Boy Pizza,” which Sarandos claimed is “the number one frozen pizza brand in Walmart.” Netflix has already seen success with events like the “Squid Game Experience” in Times Square and “Bridgerton Ball” dances, where fans arrive in costume to relive their own Regency era fantasies. Sarandos said there had been at least seven marriage proposals at these balls. “There’s a very unique relationship with IP and storytelling and people who express who they are through the shows that they love,” Sarandos noted. Coming this year is “Netflix House,” with locations planned for Philadelphia and Dallas. These venues will feature dining, experiential retail and ticketed experiences that rotate around various Netflix content. Sarandos characterized these as “the next generation of what a theme park might be” — similar to Topgolf-type experiences that people might visit four or five times a year rather than once every five years. Read more: Netflix Says Demand ‘Stable’ Amid Recession Fears Localization and Personalization While many companies are moving toward more globalization, Sarandos said Netflix is unique in that it’s both a global and local entity: It streams to a global audience and yet its offerings showcase local culture. “Our Korean team feels very much like it’s a Korean company,” he said. “They’re able to make great programming for Korea because there’s no focus on making it global.” This strategy has led to runaway hits like “Squid Game,” which became a global phenomenon despite being created specifically for Korean audiences. Sarandos said Netflix learned a counterintuitive lesson from this experience: “The more authentically local it is, the more likely it is to travel,” or do well across cultures. Sarandos said the company initially made content aimed at a global audience, mixing actors from different countries with different native languages. This approach failed, he said. While Netflix is in many countries, one glaring absence is China. Sarandos said that despite years of effort and a partnership with a Chinese video streaming company called iQiyi, “in three years, not a single episode of a single Netflix show cleared the censorship” requirements. He then realized that “they had no interest in us being in China.” Sarandos said he would watch competitors who continued pursuing the China market for years eventually reaching the same result. But in light of the tariff wars, that also means “we’re one of the rare companies in the U.S. that has no exposure to China,” Sarandos said. Netflix’s services may be global, but Sarandos emphasized it’s a U.S. company that contributes to the national economy, just like manufacturers, automakers and other industries. From 2020 to 2024, Netflix has contributed $125 million to the U.S. economy and created 140,000 production jobs, he said. Netflix has filmed in all 50 states, has 9,000 employees and owns five million square feet of studio and office space, primarily in California. “The lion’s share of our business is in the U.S.,” Sarandos said. But online streaming “gets overlooked as an industry. We get kind of thrown under the bus in trade deals occasionally. People forget that this is a real business.” The post Netflix Co-CEO Outlines Growth Strategy Beyond Streaming appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "\"Wherever there's murder and mayhem, you will always find an Addams.\" Jenna Ortega is back in the titular role for S2 of the Netflix series, Wednesday. It's been a long, long wait, but we're finally getting a second season of the Netflix supernatural horror comedy, Wednesday. The streaming giant dropped the first teaser and several first-look images to whet our appetites for what promises to be an excellent follow-up to the delightful first season. (Spoilers for S1 below.) As previously reported, director Tim Burton famously turned down the opportunity to direct the 1991 feature film The Addams Family, inspired by characters created by American cartoonist Charles Addams for The New Yorker in 1938. Wednesday showrunners Alfred Gough and Miles Millar—best known for Smallville—expected Burton to turn them down as well when they made their pitch. He signed up for the project instead.Read full article Comments",

But the YouTuber wanted more financial independence beyond the Google platform and firms willing to sponsor his channel. “… after my YouTube was growing and some of my antics [were] getting videos de-monetized, I realized I needed a playground,” Mitchell told Ars Technica in an email.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Amid the video podcast boom, Netflix is making its own move into the space. According to Business Insider, the streaming giant’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos said video podcasts may be the next format to land on the platform. During Netflix’s first-quarter earnings call Thursday, Sarandos noted that “the lines are getting blurry” between podcasts and talk shows, adding, “as the popularity of video podcasts grows, I suspect you’ll see some of them find their way to Netflix.” In 2025, audiences want to watch their podcasts. As a result, YouTube—not audio-first platforms like Spotify or Apple—has become the top destination for American podcast listeners. Data from Edison Podcast Metrics shows YouTube attracts 31% of weekly podcast listeners, compared to Spotify’s 27% and Apple’s 15%. Nearly half of podcast listeners now watch their favorite shows on Smart TVs, and in March, YouTube made up 9.7% of all TV viewing—edging out Netflix’s 8.1%. When asked about competition from YouTube, Sarandos told The Hollywood Reporter that Netflix remains the “best place for premium content, as defined by fans.” The platform already licenses content from kids’ favorite Ms. Rachel, as well as Tony Hinchcliffe, the conservative comedian behind the podcast Kill Tony. And Netflix is far from done. “We’re looking for the next generation of great creators, and we’re looking everywhere, not just in film schools and certainly not just in Hollywood,” Sarandos said during the call. When it comes to helping creators scale and monetize, Sarandos says Netflix stands apart. “You know, the question that’s out there is, is it premium? Well, some of it is, and we believe we have the best monetization model on the planet for premium storytelling,” he said. “I think we could help those creators reach an audience. Our model can also support more ambitious efforts for them, could help derisk them, unlike the kind of typical [user generated content] models.” With Netflix becoming YouTube, Instagram turning into TikTok, and X becoming… whatever X is now, no one wants to stay in their lane anymore.",

        "description": "Netflix has mentioned \"Survivor,\" pictured, in meetings for potential creator-led shows.Courtesy of Liz WilcoxNetflix is interested in competition shows starring creators on the heels of Amazon's hit \"Beast Games.\"The streaming giant is entertaining riffs on \"Survivor\" and \"The Bachelor.\"It's the latest example of media giants trying to borrow from YouTube's success.In the wake of Amazon's hit \"Beast Games,\" starring MrBeast, Netflix has been soliciting ideas for competition shows involving digital creators.The streamer has specifically name-checked the long-running franchises \"Survivor\" and \"The Bachelor\" as potential inspirations, four people familiar with the discussions told Business Insider.Netflix is still in the early stages of its efforts, and while it mentioned those shows by name, it also asked prospective creator partners to riff on the formats, one person said.\"They have mentioned that 'Beast Games' is good and has done well,\" this person added.One criticism of big media companies' earlier forays into leveraging the popularity of social-media creators has been that they tried to shoehorn influencers into old-school TV formats, with sometimes awkward results. Netflix seems to be flexible on the format and wants the creator to be active in developing it, three people said.Netflix already streams some competition shows, including \"Squid Game: The Challenge.\" On the romance front, it's garnered massive success with shows such as \"Love Is Blind.\"Two people familiar with Netflix's outreach in the creator space also said the streamer is interested in live concepts.Its most recent foray into the live space, \"Pop The Balloon\" — an adaptation of a YouTube dating series — was met with lukewarm reviews. Host Yvonne Orji told Today that future installments would be \"refined and renewed.\"Hollywood is awakening to YouTube's impactNetflix and other media giants have ramped up efforts to bring YouTubers onto their platforms. Netflix has been making the rounds with creator reps and has done deals with the Sidemen and preschool educator Ms. Rachel. Earlier this month, it premiered the docuseries \"Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing,\" centered on controversial vlogger Piper Rockelle.At the same time, top execs at Netflix have been making the case — as recently as on Thursday's earnings call — that it can be a better platform for creators than YouTube because it pays talent upfront and can amplify their reach.\"We're looking for the next generation of great creators, and we're looking everywhere,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the Thursday call.The charm offensive comes as Hollywood is waking up to the fact that young people are increasingly turning to YouTubers over more traditional fare.The Google-owned platform has led the pack in TV viewership, doubling its share to 12% in March this year from 2021, the year Nielsen first started measuring the whole TV watching pie, including streaming. During the same time period, Netflix's share has increased to about 8% from 6%.Netflix needs to keep experimenting with new types of shows as its member growth in the US and Canada slows, said Alejandro Rojas, VP of applied analytics at the data firm Parrot Analytics. Competition shows are good at retaining viewers and attracting advertisers thanks to dramatic storylines, repeated formats, and the ability to integrate products.He added that having a well-known creator at the helm could help bring in and retain new audiences. And if a show is successful in one market, like \"Love is Blind,\" the format can be imported globally.\"Competition shows can be as successful as a major scripted show,\" Rojas said.Read the original article on Business Insider Netflix has mentioned \"Survivor,\" pictured, in meetings for potential creator-led shows.Courtesy of Liz WilcoxNetflix is interested in competition shows starring creators on the heels of Amazon's hit \"Beast Games.\"The streaming giant is entertaining riffs on \"Survivor\" and \"The Bachelor.\"It's the latest example of media giants trying to borrow from YouTube's success.In the wake of Amazon's hit \"Beast Games,\" starring MrBeast, Netflix has been soliciting ideas for competition shows involving digital creators.The streamer has specifically name-checked the long-running franchises \"Survivor\" and \"The Bachelor\" as potential inspirations, four people familiar with the discussions told Business Insider.Netflix is still in the early stages of its efforts, and while it mentioned those shows by name, it also asked prospective creator partners to riff on the formats, one person said.\"They have mentioned that 'Beast Games' is good and has done well,\" this person added.One criticism of big media companies' earlier forays into leveraging the popularity of social-media creators has been that they tried to shoehorn influencers into old-school TV formats, with sometimes awkward results. Netflix seems to be flexible on the format and wants the creator to be active in developing it, three people said.Netflix already streams some competition shows, including \"Squid Game: The Challenge.\" On the romance front, it's garnered massive success with shows such as \"Love Is Blind.\"Two people familiar with Netflix's outreach in the creator space also said the streamer is interested in live concepts.Its most recent foray into the live space, \"Pop The Balloon\" — an adaptation of a YouTube dating series — was met with lukewarm reviews.

        "description": "Netflix is outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 20 percentage points as investors continue to view it as a safe play during uncertain times. Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesNetflix crushed first-quarter earnings on Thursday.Company leadership seemed entirely unconcerned about the economy, even amid Trump's trade war.It was the latest sign to investors that Netflix stock is built to weather an economic downturn.On Netflix's first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it was what co-CEO Greg Peters didn't say that carried weight.He didn't complain about a deteriorating economy, or the ongoing trade war's role in causing that. He didn't set the table for future tariff-driven price hikes, or lament high inflation.Instead, Peters dispatched with the economy talk near the beginning of the call, in an attempt to preempt any questions planned by analysts.\"We've gotten a bunch of questions,\" he said. \" We're paying close attention, clearly, to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving. But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.\"The word \"economy\" wasn't uttered another time on the call. It was straight down to Netflix's core business.The confidence conveyed sent the message to investors that Netflix is well-positioned to withstand macro turmoil. It's a perception that's helped shares soar 9% year-to-date and dominate the broader market, as well as the high-flying Magnificent 7 cohort. The stock rose another 3% in after-hours trading.The earnings report and subsequent dismissal of economic fears reaffirmed this outperformance, and reminded everyone that Netflix is trading like a \"recession-resistant\" stock.Why Netflix is recession-resistantThe idea is that if consumers start going out less because of economic uncertainty, they'll stay home and consume relatively cheap entertainment like Netflix. For context, a one-month subscription to the streaming service costs less than most movie ticket prices.Peters mentioned to analysts that the company has seen this play out over time.\"We certainly seen periods of challenging economic conditions historically in different countries, and we've generally been able to keep that positive flywheel spinning even in those situations and I think that speaks to the gap between value and price that -- and that we are for many people, a very good value even as they're being careful about where they spend,\" the co-CEO said.The company is also uniquely insulated from an advertising perspective.Advertising spend can decline substantially during an economic downturn. But because Netflix's ad business is so small, having launched the division about two years ago, an economic-fueled downturn in advertising spend would have little impact on the company's financials.\"We remain confident in Netflix's outlook given its limited advertising exposure and better protection in a potential worsening economic backdrop to many of its peers,\" analysts at MoffettNathanson said in a note on Thursday.The firm expects Netflix to grow its advertising revenue to nearly $6 billion in 2027 and about $10 billion by 2030. The company generated about $2 billion in ad revenue in 2024.A blockbuster quarterHere were the key numbers from first-quarter earnings:Revenue: $10.54 billion (+12.5% yoy), beat estimate of $10.14 billionEarnings per share: $6.61, beat estimate of $5.66Operating margin: 32%, compared to 28% in year-ago quarterQ2 revenue outlook: Expects growth of 15%, or 17% excluding currency impactRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Netflix fared better than analysts anticipated during the first three months of the year, signaling the world’s largest video streaming service is still thriving as President Donald Trump’s policies cast a pall on the economy.The numbers released Thursday indicated Netflix is still building on the momentum that enabled it to add 41 million worldwide subscribers last year—the biggest annual gain in the company’s 27-year history.But it’s unclear precisely how many more subscribers Netflix picked up during the January-March period because this report marks the first time that that the Los Gatos, California, company hasn’t provided a quarterly update on its total subscribers.Netflix announced last year it would no longer report subscriber numbers beginning with this quarter as the company seeks to shift investors’ focus to its profits after topping 300 million global subscribers in December. As part of that emphasis, Netflix is working to sell more advertising to supplement subscription dollars.Netflix’s sharper focus on its finances paid off in this year’s first quarter with earnings of $2.9 billion, or $6.61 per share, a 24% increase from from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 13% from the same time last year to $10.54 billion. Both numbers exceeded forecasts compiled by FactSet Research. Without providing details, Netflix cited ongoing subscriber growth as the main reason for its strong start this year.The robust growth came against a background of economic chaos and Trump’s fluctuating trade war. The tech industry has been hit particularly hard by the sweeping tariffs that Trump unveiled April 2 because so many bellwether companies rely on international supply chains that have been provided some relief by temporary freezes and exemptions from the fees.But Netflix’s global streaming service hasn’t been touched by Trump’s tariffs yet, making the company a notable exception that has enabled its stock price to increase 9% so far this year, while the market values of most other major tech companies have plummeted.“Netflix remains a standout in an otherwise volatile tech landscape,” said Andrew Rocco, a who tracks the stock market for Zacks Investment Research.The company’s shares rose nearly 3% in extended trading after its report came out.The trade war could still hurt Netflix if it triggers a recession or fuels inflationary pressures as many economists fear. In those scenarios, more consumers may curtail their discretionary spending on entertainment.The economic volatility could also result in a slowdown in advertising to the detriment of Netflix’s efforts to sell more commercials for a low-priced version of its streaming service that accounted for most of its last year’s subscriber growth.“We’re paying close attention clearly to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said during a Thursday conference call. “But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there’s nothing really significant to note.”Peters also said Netflix’s low-cost option, currently priced at $8 per month in the U.S., should help insulate its video streaming service if households start tightening their belts.In a sign of its confidence, Netflix reaffirmed its previous prediction for annual revenue of roughly $44 billion, up 13% from 2024.“Historically in tougher economies, home entertainment value is really important to consumer households,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos noted during the conference call. —Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer",

Shares of Netflix are sharply higher in after-hours trading on Thursday (April 17), as the world’s largest online streaming platform reported first-quarter earnings that beat the Wall Street consensus and revenue that was in line with expectations. Netflix executives said that they see no impact from President Trump’s tariffs that have been roiling the macroeconomic picture — and don’t expect it to be a major factor going forward. “We’re paying close attention, clearly, to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving, but based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there’s nothing really significant to note,” said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, during a conference call with analysts to discuss first-quarter earnings. Peters said the company also takes comfort in the fact that “entertainment, historically, has been pretty resilient in tougher economic times.” That’s because whether people are happy or sad, they still watch TV and movies. In past recessions, Netflix has been “generally quite resilient,” Peters added, meaning the company expects to do the same if a recession comes today. Moreover, Peters pointed out that Netflix offers an ad-support $7.99 a month plan in its largest markets, which is an “incredible entertainment value” that “also gives us more resilience.” “It’s an accessible price point, and we really do expect the demand for entertainment to remain strong,” Peters said. As for macroeconomic uncertainty cutting into advertising revenue, Peters said advertising remains a small part of the top line so it would not have a big impact. “That smallness probably provides us an insulation to market shifts right now,” he said. Netflix is the reigning online streaming platform with 302 million subscribers, followed by Prime Video (over 200 million) and Disney+ (125 million). Netflix reported first quarter net income of $2.89 billion, or $6.61 per diluted share, compared with $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share in the like quarter a year earnings. Revenue came to $10.54 billion, up from $9.37 billion. Netflix was expected to earn $5.66 per share on revenue of $10.5 billion, according to a consensus of analysts’ estimates. CFO Spencer Neumann said on the call that subscriber growth was “healthy” in the first quarter, without elaborating. The just-concluded quarter is the first time Netflix did not disclose its new subscriber growth numbers. The stock was up 2.7% in after-hours trading to $999. Netflix said founder Reed Hastings is stepping down as executive chairman to be chairman of the board and a non-executive director.

It hopes to double revenue by then as well, to around $80 billion, and earn $9 billion in global ad sales. The report said this year’s U.S. ad revenue is estimated at $2.15 billion, citing eMarketer figures. Netflix doesn’t disclose its ad sales numbers. Executives also want to triple Netflix’s operating income to $30 billion by 2030, the report said, and increase subscriber count to 410 million. Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said internally executives do discuss “long-term aspirations.” But he said “this is not the same as forecast,” adding that its operating plans remain the same as its external forecasting guidance. However, Peters added that Netflix does see potential for growth. Even with more than 300 million subscriber households, translating to an audience of more than 700 million people, it’s still a small slice of the global market. “We’ve got plenty of room to grow our engagement, our revenue, our profit, and … become the most valued entertainment company,” Peters said. Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin said in a research note this week that Netflix’s financial aspirations reported by the Journal “seem consistent” with management’s previous disclosures. However, these targets seem like “stretch” goals and will be “difficult to achieve,” the analyst said. Dolgin said Netflix became successful by following a strategy of growing organically from the ground up instead of through costly acquisitions of traditional media businesses. The company also was “wise” not to overspend by not bidding for a regular slate of major live sports programming, the analyst said, because it would have had to overpay to attract major sports leagues, the analyst said. “These decisions now give Netflix the advantage of not having to manage a declining legacy business, and it isn’t burdened with expensive sports contracts or a subscriber base that is dependent on retaining sports rights,” Dolgin wrote.

Netflix launched its ad tech platform on April 1, it said in its earnings announcement on Thursday, and is \"on track to roll it out in our remaining ads countries in the coming months.\"Ahead of a 4:45 p.m. presentation about the results, analysts were also looking for any effects from President Donald Trump's trade war and rhetoric about other countries where Netflix operates, as some analysts had revised down their subscriber growth expectations for some countries outside the US in the lead-up to Thursday's earnings report.The service has big growth plans: Netflix is targeting a market cap of $1 trillion by 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.Netflix's stock has outperformed the broader indexes and other major technology stocks so far this year.Viewers are likely to keep watching Netflix programming — or even consume more of it — if the US slips into recession, some analysts have said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos.Earl Gibson III/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty ImagesNetflix will stop sharing quarterly subscription figures, starting with its first-quarter report Thursday.So, what will Wall Street be looking for?Analysts are interested in Netflix's ad progress, as well as its creator and sports strategies.Netflix is set to report its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, but there's a big twist. It will no longer break out subscription figures, which had been a central barometer that many on Wall Street used to gauge the health of its business.Why the change? Netflix has said it wants to shift the conversation to other metrics like user engagement and revenue, which it contends are more indicative of its success as it matures.After a blockbuster fourth quarter — when it had its biggest-ever haul of new subscribers, helped by live sports events — several analysts expect Netflix to have a more modest first quarter based on a softer content lineup.So, in the absence of subscriber numbers, what will Wall Street be looking at?\"Frankly, I think all of us are going into this with a blindfold, not knowing what they'll disclose,\" Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon told Business Insider. \"But at the end of the day, it's about the health of their financials and the margin expansion trajectory versus the last several quarters.\"Here are some other topics Wall Street will be focused on.Its ads rollout: Analysts will be listening for any details on Netflix's ad rollout, which it's relying on to show substantial growth in the years to come. Netflix has said it expected to double its ad revenue haul this year after it increased its ad commitments by 150% during last year's TV upfronts season, and analysts are holding them to it.\"The most important thing is to see if they are growing revenue because of advertising,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. \"I know they are, but would like some color on that.

It will no longer break out subscription figures, which had been a central barometer that many on Wall Street used to gauge the health of its business.Why the change? Netflix has said it wants to shift the conversation to other metrics like user engagement and revenue, which it contends are more indicative of its success as it matures.After a blockbuster fourth quarter — when it had its biggest-ever haul of new subscribers, helped by live sports events — several analysts expect Netflix to have a more modest first quarter based on a softer content lineup.So, in the absence of subscriber numbers, what will Wall Street be looking at?\"Frankly, I think all of us are going into this with a blindfold, not knowing what they'll disclose,\" Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon told Business Insider. \"But at the end of the day, it's about the health of their financials and the margin expansion trajectory versus the last several quarters.\"Here are some other topics Wall Street will be focused on.Its ads rollout: Analysts will be listening for any details on Netflix's ad rollout, which it's relying on to show substantial growth in the years to come. Netflix has said it expected to double its ad revenue haul this year after it increased its ad commitments by 150% during last year's TV upfronts season, and analysts are holding them to it.\"The most important thing is to see if they are growing revenue because of advertising,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. \"I know they are, but would like some color on that. They should get lots of operating leverage from holding costs in check, so I expect big profits.\"Yoon also said he'll be listening closely for intel on the health of the ad market.Economic uncertainty: The big question hanging over Wall Street's otherwise bullish stance on Netflix is how the on-and-off tariffs could impact its burgeoning ad business.Netflix significantly dropped its ad rates after Amazon flooded the market by introducing ads to Prime Video last year.

        "description": "Bank of America called Netflix stock a \"defensive choice\" compared to other tech companies. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhotoNetflix shares have outperformed a struggling broader market this year, rising more than 10%.The stock is seen by some analysts as particularly well-positioned to withstand a recession.Shares climbed more than 5% on Tuesday on a report the company is aiming to double revenue by 2030.What sell-off?As major stock indexes have gotten off to a rocky start this year, Netflix has been a beacon of strength, handily outpacing the broader market and its mega-cap tech peers.The company has climbed more than 10% since the start of January, compared to an 8% loss for the S&P 500 and an even-sharper 17% decline for the elite Magnificent 7 cohort.Netflix's market domination continued on Tuesday, with shares surging as much as 6% on a report that the company is aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030. (It's currently valued at $420 billion.)But that doesn't tell the whole story. To fully appreciate Netflix's vast outperformance, one must look at how the stock has held up over a longer period that has featured repeated recession alarms.Bank of America highlighted Netflix's recession-averse nature in a Tuesday research note in which they reiterated their \"buy\" rating on the stock. Its 12-month price target of $1,175 marks 26% upside from Monday's close.\"Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors and driven outperformance versus other technology/Mag 7 companies,\" analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote.Joe Terranova, chief market strategist at Virtus Investment, also considers Netflix a \"recession resistant\" stock.\"Think about consumer behaviors in a recessionary climate. What are you going to be doing less of?\" Terranova said on CNBC on Tuesday. \"Less of going out to find entertainment, and actually staying home to enjoy the entertainment you have with Netflix.\"For Bank of America, Netflix has ample opportunity for long-term growth through subscriber growth in international markets, subscription price increases, and advertising growth.\"The company still sees a significant opportunity for growth, driven in large part by expansion into international markets,\" the strategists wrote.\"To the extent the company sees a runway for continued strong subscriber growth, we think it should give investors confidence in Netflix's ability to grow over the next several years,\" they added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Netflix aims to double its revenue over the next five years, WSJ reports. Netflix plans to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported this week, citing anonymous people who attended an “annual business review meeting” that Netflix held in March. Netflix's current market capitalization is nearly $400 billion. Netflix is reportedly partnering its market cap goals with plans to double revenue within the same time frame. For 2024, Netflix reported $39 billion in revenue, meaning the company aims to raise its annual revenue to $78 billion in five years. Compared to the prior five years, Netflix’s revenue grew 93.5 percent from 2019 ($20.16 billion) to 2024. However, that time period represented a different market, one where streaming subscriber counts were rising rapidly, and Netflix faced less competition than it does today. However, Netflix's 2030 revenue goals are also dependent on its advertising business, something Netflix lacked in 2019.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "It is 6 p.m. You have logged off from work and are unwinding with a glass of wine. You turn on the TV, but instead of Netflix, you click on a new app called 6pm in Paris, and spend the next 30 minutes learning French. Not on your desk. Not on your phone. But on your couch, watching a short movie. This is the vision behind a new language learning platform that recently launched. 6pm in Paris merges Netflix’s addictive streaming format with the short lessons style of Masterclass. The concept is simple yet effective: Each week, you pick a short film from a curated collection of French licensed movies. Then, you dive into the story and language through an informal video lesson called “After Short.” You can watch the films with dual subtitles and adjust the playback speed to your preference. Diligent learners can also review a phrasebook of key words and idioms, then take a short quiz to reinforce their knowledge. While apps like Duolingo are pouring resources into AI and gamified learning, 6pm in Paris is choosing culture—and therefore the human experience—as its primary lens. “A big part of our vision is to be a window on the language, and the people, and the culture,” says CEO and cofounder Lea Perret, who dreamed up the company with cofounder and COO Julien Frei. If people take to the format, you can soon expect 6pm in Tokyo, and 6pm in Rio—and basically 6pm anywhere. Julien Frei and Léa Perret [Image: 6pm in Paris] Learning as a lifelong journey Perret imagined 6pm in Paris as a way to help students learn French beyond the classroom. “Most people will sell you methods to learn French in three weeks, but it doesn’t work like that; it’s a lifelong endeavor,” she says. And if you want to spend a lifetime learning a language, it has to be entertaining, or else you will throw in the towel. Originally from Toulouse, France, Perret moved to New York 17 years ago and has been teaching French in the U.S. since then. In 2013, she cofounded Coucou French Classes, which provides in-person classes in New York and Los Angeles. Since the pandemic, her team also launched online classes to over 50,000 students. Today, the company remains profitable, but 6pm in Paris is here to fill a gap that Coucou couldn’t: to help people immerse themselves in French culture. While Perret was at Coucou (she left to run 6pm in Paris) students would often ask her for additional resources to help them improve their French. In response, she would send them a “17-pager” recommending, among other things, French books and TV shows to watch. (Yes, Call My Agent featured on the list.) These shows, however, can be too long, which can wear out the learner, and the subtitles can be either inaccurate or incomplete, completely skipping quintessentially French filler words like “euh” or “eh ben.” This approach, she says, can take learners away from real language experiences and make it harder for them to connect the spoken word with its written form. [Image: 6pm in Paris] The 6pm philosophy With 6pm in Paris, the team is hoping to address many of these challenges with shorter, more digestible films and customizable subtitles that were crafted in-house to perfectly match the dialogue. For now, the team has licensed more than 60 short films by local filmmakers. These range from sci-fi to rom-coms to documentaries. The shortest lasts a mere two minutes; the longest clocks in at 25. (My personal favorites so far are Cloud Paradise, and Amoureuxse, both of which boast excellent storytelling.) By next year—if the team can raise the $1.2 million they need to grow—they want to start producing films in-house, which would allow them to tailor the content to various levels by, for example, streaming down the dialogue so actors don’t talk over each other. They also expect to launch a whopping 170 masterclasses covering grammar for all levels. The series will feature short, digestible episodes delving into French conjugation. “We believe in grammar, we just think there is entertaining efficient way to bring it to people so it doesn’t feel like a chore,” says Perret. The current selection is more suitable to someone with an intermediate understanding of French, but the team maintains this shouldn’t preclude anyone from subscribing to 6pm in Paris. In fact, they believe that segmenting learners by levels—and tailoring content accordingly—is the wrong approach. The 6pm in Paris philosophy is that one of the most essential ingredients to learning a new language is exposure. “Sure, you can start by learning the phrase, ‘je m’appelle Lea et j’habite à New York,’ but what’s point of knowing how to say that if you don’t understand what the person replies to you?” she says. According to Perret, Americans are obsessed with talking, but even more important are listening and comprehension. By watching a short film in French, even with English or French subtitles, you can slowly soak up the language, notice how words are spelled, and train your ear before ever uttering a single word. As someone who moved to a French-speaking country at age 7 and was encouraged to sit at the back of the class and “just listen,” I can attest to the efficiency of this method. (I was fluent in less than a year.) [Image: 6pm in Paris] TV as a learning tool Research backs this up, and many studies show that watching TV shows, especially with O.G. subtitles, can be a surprisingly effective way to build your real-world language skills. According to a 2022 study from researchers in Turkey, 44 participants from Kosovo who watched Turkish TV series with subtitles for one to two years saw measurable improvements in all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing.) Another study from Spain shows that university students who watched Friends over the course of seven weeks, and with English subtitles, learned more informal English (like slang and idioms) than those who used Spanish subtitles. Television might be the greatest source of first language input, and learning a foreign language by watching TV is more common than it might seem. According to a recent survey performed by the research platform AtomRadar for Fast Company, 43% of participants have tried to learn a foreign language by watching TV shows or movies. Of these people, 60% found it effective. AtomRadar, which surveyed a representative panel of 300 American adults over 18, also found that younger people are substantially more likely to have tried learning a foreign language through movies and TV, with 55% of 18 to 24 year olds having tried it, compared to only 30% of 55 to 64 year olds. (Once again, I can relate as I distinctly remember looking up the definition of “rooting for someone” after a love triangle materialized on the teen-cult TV show One Tree Hill.) 6pm in Paris isn’t the first company to recognize the potential for cinema to double as a learning tool. FluentU uses beginner-friendly movie trailers and music videos to teach you vocabulary and grammar in context. Lingopie offers a streaming library of foreign-language TV shows with interactive subtitles. And France Channel, which lets you stream French films and series otherwise unavailable in the U.S., markets its platform as a way to learn the language through immersion. Earlier this year, Duolingo, too, recognized the power of cinema with a Korean campaign in collaboration with Netflix. Korean course sign-ups had jumped 40% after the first season of Squid Game aired in 2021, so when season 2 rolled around in 2025, Duolingo launched Squid Game-themed vocabulary lessons, a TikTok filter that could test your pronunciation skills, a K-pop music video, and a music video featuring Duo the owl suited up as a Pink Guard. Is 6pm in Paris worried about all the competition? Not in the slightest. She notes that her team wasn’t inspired to start a new company to fill a gap in the market, but to meet their students’ needs. The outputs may be similar but the motivations are different. The company is still too young to gauge success, but the first few months show promise: After a beta run with Coucou students, the team opened up the platform to the public and leaned heavily on a marketing campaign to attract subscribers. So far, 1,300 people have joined (and 70% of users who started with a free 7-day trial have converted to a paid subscription). Three quarters of subscribers log in every week to watch the weekly film, followed by the “after short.” For now, you can only watch on your laptop or by casting to a Smart TV. But once the team secures more backing, they plan to upgrade to a more robust (and pricier) streaming platform that supports native TV apps. Some years down the line, you could soon turn on your TV, click on your 6pm streaming app, and choose which language you want to learn based on the culture you want to discover. “I want it to be as easy as ‘you turn on TV, go to 6pm in Tokyo and discover many things about the Japanese culture,” says Perret. “I do believe there would be lot more understanding, and the world would be a better place if we knew more about each other.”",

        "description": "\"... our members are going to be punished.\" Debate around how much taxes US-based streaming services should pay internationally, among other factors, could result in people paying more for subscriptions to services like Netflix and Disney+. On April 10, the United Kingdom's Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee reignited calls for a streaming tax on subscription revenue acquired through UK residents. The recommendation came alongside the committee's 120-page report [PDF] that makes numerous recommendations for how to support and grow Britain’s film and high-end television (HETV) industry. For the US, the recommendation garnering the most attention is one calling for a 5 percent levy on UK subscriber revenue from streaming video on demand services, such as Netflix. That’s because if streaming services face higher taxes in the UK, costs could be passed onto consumers, resulting in more streaming price hikes. The CMS committee wants money from the levy to support HETV production in the UK and wrote in its report:Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Magnolia Pictures; Netflix; Columbia Pictures; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIJudy Greer isn't sitting next to me, but I can feel her friendliness and warmth radiating through the Zoom screen. It's an experience similar to watching one of her many movies and TV shows, in which she often plays the supportive best friend or the trusted confidant: when you see Greer on screen, you know you're in good hands.Greet often uses the word \"fun\" when reminiscing about her turns in memorable rom-coms like \"13 Going on 30,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" and \"27 Dresses\" during our conversation. But her latest film is a tonal departure, to say the least.In \"Eric LaRue,\" the actor strips away her signature wit to portray Janice LaRue, a withdrawn mother who has the unimaginable task of trying to move forward after her teenage son shoots and kills three of his classmates.Judy Greer as Janice in \"Eric LaRue.\"Magnolia PicturesIn the drama, which is based on a stage play by Brett Neveu and is actor Michael Shannon's feature directorial debut, Greer delivers the kind of dark, deeply emotional performance she doesn't often get to showcase. Greer credits Shannon, whom she's known for years and worked with previously, with motivating her to take on such a heavy role outside her comfort zone.\"I don't get sent roles like this,\" Greer said. \"To do something that was challenging for me and stretched me as an artist and scared me as an artist, I thought was really important. And I think it makes me a better actor, too.\"For the latest interview in Business Insider's Role Play series, Greer reflects on her first professional disappointment, the fans she loves the most, and how she ended up playing a re-engineered cyborg pig in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\"On her breakout role in the cult classic 'Jawbreaker' and her friendship with her '13 Going on 30' costar Jennifer GarnerGreer and Julie Benz in \"Jawbreaker.\"TriStar PicturesBusiness Insider: \"Jawbreaker\" is one of your earliest iconic films. The movie has a cult following now, but back then it had a different reception. How did that affect you at the time, so early in your career?Judy Greer: It was the first job I got in Los Angeles. I'd been here for two weeks, maybe even one week, when I auditioned, so it was a transformative experience.There were so many teen scream kind of movies coming out and all the same girls were auditioning for all of them. We were all in waiting rooms of casting offices together all the time, so it felt like I got to do mine.It's interesting because when it came out, it wasn't a box office hit. But also, it taught me early in my career that you do the work, you focus on the work, you focus on what you're doing, and then you move on and you can't wait around and expect something. You just have no idea what's going to happen with anything that you do. The one thing that you think is going to be a massive success can sometimes just not really perform.And then while you're shooting that movie, you make your best friend and you're like, \"Oh, well, that's why I'm there. I'm there to learn to act. I'm there to make friends. I'm there to make relationships with people and to tell stories.\"Greer and Jennifer Garner in \"13 Going on 30.\"Sony PicturesSpeaking of friendships, you and Jennifer Garner are still great friends years after \"13 Going on 30,\" which is impressive. What do you attribute that lasting friendship to?I think it's hard, no matter what you do for a living, to stay friends for a really long time. Life can really get in the way of friendships, but I think with all friendships you have to work at them. I think with her and I — I know she has friends like this and I have other friends like this — if you don't take it personally that you can't return a phone call or text right away, then I think that you're off to a really good start [laughs].People get busy, we're busy. I think it's hard to maintain friendships, especially as an adult. And when you're juggling work and you're juggling kids and all the things, aging parents, moving, all this stuff, it's just hard. You have to really focus on your friendships. And I think a lot of times it's easy to take them for granted, but I'm here to say don't.On fake-slapping Katherine Heigl and her favorite raunchy fan interactionsGreer as Kitty Sanchez in season two of \"Arrested Development.\"FoxAnother one of your well-known roles is Casey in \"27 Dresses.\" What was it like playing the foil to Katherine Heigl's type-A character, Jane?It's funny because I'm so much more type-A, I'm so much more like Jane than Casey. It's always fun to be that character because your hair can be a little off and your clothes can be a little off. You don't have to be so perfect.Is there a standout memory from working on that set that you still think about?Slapping Katherine Heigl across the face. I hate when I have to slap people. I've had to do it before and it's really stressful, but it's also scary. And in that one, I don't think I actually hit her. It's just really scary because you're in the moment and you're like, \"Hey, what are you doing?\"And then you're like [imitates slapping sound].There was one movie I did called \"What Planet Are You From?\" where I had to slap Garry Shandling across the face, and my director, Mike Nichols was like, \"Just hit him. We have to shoot it. Just hit him.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh!\" And I just smacked him so hard and everyone was like, \"Oh!\" You could see in the movie, his actual reaction, he's like, \"Huh!?\" That was earlier in my career. So after that, slapping people has always made me really nervous.But in that one, she sold it. I didn't actually hit her face.\"Arrested Development\" is another role of yours that always comes up, I'm sure. What was the best part about playing such an over-the-top character like Kitty?It's fun to just really be able to do and say whatever you want. I felt like Kitty was just a wild animal. Nothing she said ever made sense or was fair or probably even honest, but anything goes with Kitty Sanchez.When we were doing those first three seasons, I felt like we were in a vacuum. When I would be out and about in the world or traveling and someone would come up to me and say that they loved me on \"Arrested Development,\" I felt like they were a real fan because it was like, who's watching the show? And now it's such a cult classic hit that it's funny, I feel like everyone has seen it.But at the time, I felt like if someone recognized me from \"Arrested Development\" or \"Archer,\" I was like, \"OK, you really looked for my name in that.\"Do fans still flash you and say the classic line? Is that still happening to you?Yes. And more, please. I love walking through an airport and having someone be like, \"Say goodbye to these!\" I'm here for it. It's the best.On playing a cyborg pig and making the jump to blockbuster moviesGreer in \"Ant-Man.\"Disney/MarvelThere was this moment where you were in a bunch of different franchises: \"Planet of the Apes,\" \"Ant-Man, \"Jurassic World,\" and \"Halloween.\" Why did you want to do those big-budget movies, and what did you learn from doing them?My takeaway is that just because it has a big budget doesn't always mean that the catering is better! Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not.I was doing great. I was really happy with my career. And then I thought, just to take it back to \"Eric LaRue\" for a minute, these really important independent movies and these more interesting roles, I felt like I would have more access to them if I got my name out a little bit more in some of those bigger movies.Those franchise films are incredible, and I learned so much and I had so much fun doing all of them. But I thought in the big picture of my career, getting an opportunity to work on movies of that scale could potentially — and seems like it's working, knock on wood — get me access to different types of roles in smaller movies. And that was something that I felt like I succeeded in.You've played not one, but two Marvel characters, Maggie in \"Ant-Man,\" and then also voicing War Pig in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" which is so random.It's not random because I'm friends with James Gunn, so I was excited that he was like, \"Hey, would you want to do this one weird thing?\" And I was like, \"Yeah!\"I was just about to ask, how did you come to play a re-engineered cyborg pig?It was a bucket list item for me, definitely. When thinking about how many cyborg pigs are there to play and how many opportunities… I'm kidding.I'm a fan of the movies and, obviously, the Marvel Universe, so I was excited to come in. I was not allowed to tell anyone, so it was also fun to keep a secret for a little while until the movie came out.On wishing her acting school gave business advice and the role she'd love to revisitYou spoke about how certain jobs helped you later on in terms of understanding the industry, but what's the best business decision you've ever made for your career?I think when I was young, it was to keep auditioning. I think I was super open to anything out there. I wasn't ever picky. And I think that did a lot for me at the time.I think that we forget sometimes that auditioning is acting. And if you audition a lot, you get to act a lot. And if you act a lot, you get better at your craft. So, I try not to think of those auditions all the time as scary, but as an opportunity to act every day.I also think from a business standpoint, saving my money was really smart [laughs]. It gave me the ability to be a little bit more selective now as I've gotten older and to do smaller movies that are really important to me, movies like \"Eric LaRue.\"At my acting school that I went to, which I love so much, I always was like, \"You guys need to have a business class for actors. You need to teach us what to do when we graduate, like how to live, because that's not what we're good at as artists.\" Some artists are, but in general, I think saving my money, not buying stupid expensive cars and that kind of",

        "description": "Ars chats with cinematographer Hillary Fyfe Spera on bringing a 1970s film vibe to the Marvel series. Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel's revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D'Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season that is currently filming. (Some spoilers for the series below, but no major reveals beyond the opening events of the first episode.) Born Again was initially envisioned as more of an episodic reset rather than a straight continuation of the serialized Netflix series. But during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, with production halted, the studio gave the show a creative overhaul more in line with the Netflix tone, even though six episodes had been largely completed by then. The pilot was reshot completely, and new footage was added to subsequent episodes to ensure narrative continuity with the original Daredevil—with a few well-placed nods to other characters in the MCU for good measure.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The co-CEO for Netflix just took a major swipe at YouTube, sharing his thoughts about his company being a better space for creators. Ted Sarandos mentioned how the popular streaming service can amplify the reach that top YouTubers like Ms. Rachel attain for a bigger audience. He similarly contrasted how the model of Netflix is much different than that seen with Disney’s local programming IP export model.It’s certainly some major words to claim, as we’re all aware of the greatness that YouTube brings in today’s time for the television world. But Sarandos feels that creators there aren’t getting the compensation and growth they could attain from Netflix.The co-CEO then went on to shed light on how Netflix has a better model for monetization. YouTube isn’t giving creators money up front to generate content. They’re doing this at a risk, and big names like MrBeast end up losing so much money on this front. Then Sarandos shared how MrBeast is going around raising money, which is shocking because with his audience figures, he wouldn’t need to do that if he had Netflix. Instead, he’d be giving out more money to others. Despite the criticism of the app’s payment system, MrBeast did prove how creators lose funds on Hollywood deals. For instance, he’s gone public about losing tens of millions through a show on Amazon called Beast of Games. We’ve seen Netflix disrupt the whole Hollywood and win streaming wars. It’s got more than 300M people tuning in from all over the globe and growing ad businesses. Lately, YouTube has made headlines with a large share of the television viewing content model. Netflix continues to lean towards big names on YouTube, where it picked up huge deals. The app amplifies YouTubers having a huge reach. Ms. Rachel is among the top 10 shows viewed every single week, even since her arrival on the streaming platform. YouTube is really quite like a farm league where many creators could develop more ideas. They will work hard and do something major, including taking financial risks. Remember, the CEO also shared how YouTube is a mega competition in terms of advertising dollars, and Netflix still leads the pack for better quality in terms of viewership. People know they are coming here to watch and not waste time. Critics argue that Netflix and YouTube serve different purposes for big creators, making direct comparisons misleading. While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos claims his platform offers better monetization, YouTube provides top creators with greater control, flexibility, and long-term revenue potential.YouTube allows creators to own their content, diversify earnings through ads, sponsorships, and memberships, and engage directly with their audience. Netflix, in contrast, operates on a closed model, offering select creators upfront payments but limiting creative freedom and ongoing revenue opportunities. While Netflix may amplify a creator’s reach, it does not provide the same ecosystem for sustained success and independent brand-building.Sarandos’ argument overlooks the fact that YouTube enables creators to take risks on their own terms while benefiting from multiple income streams. For many top YouTubers, the ability to control their content and revenue makes YouTube a more attractive platform than Netflix’s curated system.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Google Agrees on $100M Settlement for Lawsuit Accusing It of Misleading Advertisers",

        "description": "Here are eight shows and documentaries that use the single-take format of \"Adolescence,\" or explore similar themes to the Netflix drama. Owen Cooper plays Jamie Miller and Stephen Graham portrays his father in \"Adolescence.\"Netflix\"Adolescence\" is Netflix's latest hit.The drama's views have nearly doubled in the past week, according to Netflix's charts.The series has just four episodes, so here are nine other documentaries and TV series to watch next.\"Adolescence,\" Netflix's latest hit, is a four-episode limited crime drama with each filmed in a single take.Tackling the UK's knife crime epidemic and the impact of misogynistic influencers on boys, the series follows a working-class father (Stephen Graham) who discovers his son (Owen Cooper) has murdered a girl from his school.Fans and critics have praised the series for its innovative use of filming episodes in one take and stellar performances from the cast, including Graham and Cooper. They've also praised the show for highlighting how boys are being influenced by misogynistic and sexist messaging on social media.The show, co-created by Graham and Jack Thorne, is also racking up views on Netflix.Netflix said the series received 42 million views this week, almost double the total for its premiere week.If you've already seen it, here are nine shows and documentaries similar to \"Adolescence\" or expand on its themes.'Boiling Point'Stephen Graham also stars in \"Boiling Point.\"Kevin Baker / BBCStephen Graham's first foray with single takes was \"Boiling Point,\" a 2021 film and a follow-up miniseries of the same name.Graham stars in both and became a co-creator of the series.The film and the series are like a British equivalent of the Emmy-winning show \"The Bear,\" focusing on the intense and unhealthy working environments inside a restaurant kitchen in London. While the film is entirely one-take, the TV series has a single-take sequence at the start.The \"Boiling Point\" miniseries is available on Prime Video and Roku. The movie is available on Peacock.'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story'Cooper Koch plays Erik Menendez in \"Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.\"Miles Crist / Netflix\"Monster: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\" the second miniseries in Netflix's true crime anthology created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, follows the 1990s case of two siblings who killed their parents. They later admitted to the crime and said that their parents abused them.The series is far from as grounded as \"Adolescence\" with soap opera acting, multiple perspective shifts, and scenes of sensationalized violence.This is all stripped away in episode five, where Erik Menendez (Cooper Koch) first tells Leslie Abramson (Ari Graynor), his lawyer, about his abuse. It's the shortest episode of the season but the most powerful, with the single take focusing solely on Erik's chilling and emotional confession.Fans and critics had mixed opinions about the series, but it may be worth watching for that remarkable episode alone.The limited series is available on Netflix.'Criminal: UK'\"Criminal: UK\" has guest stars in each episode, including British stars such as Kit Harington.Colin HuttonFans of \"Adolescence\" episode three might love \"Criminal: UK,\" a Netflix crime series set only in the interrogation room of a police station, and its European spin-off.\"Criminal\" lacks the action and adrenaline rush of usual crime shows that show the chase to find the culprit. Yet it's just as suspenseful, displaying interrogators' mind games and other tactics to get the criminal to crack and confess.The two seasons of \"Criminal: UK\" is available on Netflix.'Defending Jacob'Chris Evans stars as a district attorney in \"Defending Jacob.\"AppleTV+Like \"Adolescence,\" \"Defending Jacob\" is about two parents who are confused and distraught after their teenage son is arrested following the murder of a classmate.In this dark murder mystery series, Chris Evans stars as Andy Barber, a father and district attorney who tries to prove his son's innocence. Meanwhile, his wife Laurie (Michelle Dockery) has doubts about their son after his arrest.This series focuses on the parents' reaction to the accusation and what they would do to help the child, leaving it ambiguous if the son did, in fact, commit the crime.The limited series is available on Apple TV+.'The Social Dilemma'Skyler Gisondo in \"The Social Dilemma.\"Expsoure Labs / Netflix\"The Social Dilemma\" is a part-documentary, part-narrative drama that delves deeper into the negative impact social media can have on younger people in particular.The documentary section features interviews with former workers of social media platforms and a psychologist who discusses how these platforms affect mental health.The drama section follows a family with two social media-addicted children: a boy who is being radicalized online, and a girl who is depressed due to unrealistic beauty standards online.The docudrama is available on Netflix.'I Am Andrew Tate'Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer turned influencer.DANIEL MIHAILESCU/Getty ImagesIn recent years, Andrew Tate has become the most recognizable \"manosphere\" figure — a term for podcasters and influencers who promote masculinity and misogyny.This documentary depicts Tate's rise and fall after the influencer and his brother, Tristan, were arrested in December 2022 in Romania. They were charged with human trafficking, rape, and forming an organized crime group. Both have denied the charges and are yet to face a trial.The documentary is available on Peacock.'Social Studies'\"Social Studies\" gives a glimpse of teens' lives in a digital age.Lauren Greenfield / INSTITUTE\"Social Studies,\" a documentary series about growing up in the digital age, is another great series to watch for greater insight into young people's lives and how social media affects them.The series follows a group of diverse teens from Los Angeles for a year, addressing issues from vigilante justice on social media to sexual exploration.The limited series is available to stream on Hulu.'Baby Reindeer'Richard Gadd in \"Baby Reindeer.\"Ed Miller/NetflixIf you somehow missed the hype around \"Baby Reindeer\" last year, the dark comedy focuses on a male comedian who is stalked by a woman and receives little help from the authorities due to the stigma against male victims of harassment.The show was loosely based on the experiences of the creator and lead star, Richard Gadd, though Netflix labeling the show as a true story got the streamer in legal difficulties.There's not much crossover with the key themes of \"Adolescence,\" but \"Baby Reindeer\" is another British hit from Netflix that innovatively tackles a wider social issue.The limited series is available to stream on Netflix.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Before, Netflix users could only stream HDR titles in Dolby Vision or HDR10. Netflix announced today that it has started offering HDR movies and shows in the HDR10+ format. Since December 2014, when season 1 of Marco Polo debuted, Netflix has supported the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Like Dolby Vision, HDR10+ is a more advanced form of HDR that uses dynamic metadata fine-tuned to specific content. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision let creatives set how each frame looks, enabling a final result that should have more detail and look closer to how the content's creators intended. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are especially impactful when watching HDR content on lower-priced HDR TVs that could suffer from poor black levels and other performance gaps. You have to subscribe to Netflix's Premium ad-free plan to stream content in HDR and 4K resolution. The plan is $25 per month, compared to $18 per month for the Standard ad-free plan that limits users to 1080p resolution.Read full article Comments",

I was only half-listening, focused on the endless to-do list in my brain.I felt skeptical as she explained the plot of \"Arcane\"— an animated steampunk series featuring two sisters on opposite sides of a war between a tech utopia and a destitute undercity. Still, I agreed to try an episode on Netflix.Several days, two seasons, and 18 episodes later, I realized how much I had enjoyed \"Arcane.\" Not only did I love the show, but watching it with my teen brought us closer and helped us communicate better.Being open-minded about my teen's interests helped me find something new to enjoyBefore my daughter mentioned it, I didn't know \"Arcane\" existed. At first glance, the show didn't appeal to me; my interests tend more toward live-action shows about relationships, like \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Nobody Wants This.\"As I sat down with my daughter to watch the first episode, I was convinced that the next 44 minutes would be the last I'd invest in the show. My teen had assured me that if I didn't like \"Arcane,\" she didn't expect me to keep watching. I thought I'd suffer through one episode to show my daughter I'd tried, and then I could get back to watching what I liked.But to my surprise, one episode turned into two, then three. Within weeks, my daughter and I had finished both seasons. My Instagram feed, once predictably populated with midlife parenting tips and overnight oats recipes, was filled with memes from the series. I began lurking in Reddit's \"Arcane\" community, following conversations about different characters.Watching the show together enabled my daughter and me to connectIn the roller coaster of teenage years, I've struggled with my tendency to lecture my kids. There is so much I want to teach them, but the more fervently I try to share advice, the more they disengage.Watching \"Arcane\" with my daughter changed this dynamic, enabling genuine, back-and-forth conversations about the show and life. Each episode became a cherished ritual, a rare pocket of time when we could escape school, work, and the drudgery of everyday routines.As we watched the story unfold, my daughter and I shared reactions and questions with each other. What would it feel like to be estranged from your sibling like the main characters? Why did one sister put her faith in someone who seemed to radiate evil? Which character was the most moral?In this space, I didn't feel compelled to lecture or prove a point; instead, I listened more and talked less. I could see how my daughter's worldview is taking shape and how it sometimes differs from mine.The show included some poignant truths about parentingI didn't expect to find parenting wisdom in an animated show about a fictional war. Yet there were moments during \"Arcane\" when I felt the characters were speaking directly to me, voicing undeniable truths about raising kids.Just like in the real world, the parental figures in \"Arcane\" realize that having children deeply and irrevocably changes you. In a memorable scene, one of the villains muses, \"Is there anything so undoing as a daughter?\"The simple line stuck with me. My two daughters undid everything I thought I knew about myself. In the most beautiful way, they transformed my life, priorities, and decisions.As my kids hurtle toward young adulthood, I've found it difficult to let go of control and the belief that they need my constant protection. But among other things, \"Arcane\" reminded me that no matter what we do, our children's lives often turn out to be wildly different than we envisioned. What kids need most is our love and acceptance.In the darkness of winter, \"Arcane\" was a bright and unexpected gift. Now, as I look for the first signs of spring, I'll also be searching eagerly for the next show my daughter and I can enjoy together.Read the original article on Business Insider The author and her daughter watched Netflix's \"Arcane\" together.Caia Image/Getty Images/Collection Mix: Subjects RFMy teen convinced me to watch a Netflix animated series I thought I'd hate.Watching \"Arcane\" together sparked genuine conversations and a deeper connection with my teen.I also found surprising snippets of parenting wisdom in the show.In the throes of a soul-crushing Midwest winter, my 13-year-old daughter approached me with a look of steely resolve. \"Mom, there's this new show we should watch,\" she said.\"What kind of show?\" I asked.

In the most beautiful way, they transformed my life, priorities, and decisions.As my kids hurtle toward young adulthood, I've found it difficult to let go of control and the belief that they need my constant protection. But among other things, \"Arcane\" reminded me that no matter what we do, our children's lives often turn out to be wildly different than we envisioned. What kids need most is our love and acceptance.In the darkness of winter, \"Arcane\" was a bright and unexpected gift. Now, as I look for the first signs of spring, I'll also be searching eagerly for the next show my daughter and I can enjoy together.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle in \"The Electric State.\"Paul Abell/NetflixLike any other studio, Netflix has produced some hits and some stinkers.But in recent years, it seems Netflix has been throwing more and more money at subpar action films.Its latest release, \"The Electric State,\" cost $320 million to make, and barely anyone likes it.This month, Netflix released its most expensive movie yet, \"The Electric State,\" which reportedly cost at least $320 million to make.That puts it in the top 15 most expensive movies of all time, unadjusted for inflation — and, somehow, it doesn't seem to matter to Netflix that none of its movies make any money at the box office.In 2022, the streamer seemed poised to change its business model, with The Hollywood Reporter positing that the \"era of expensive vanity projects\" was over at Netflix. However, as Slate pointed out, that didn't mean budgets were going down.In fact, it was the exact opposite. Since 2022, multiple Netflix originals have been released with budgets in the hundreds of millions. But they haven't been critical darlings like \"The Irishman\" or \"Mank.\" Instead, they've been what some refer to as, well, \"slop.\"Using publicly available info about budgets, critics' scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and user ratings on Letterboxd, we found 11 Netflix Original movies that cost the streamer, in total, over $1.5 billion to produce that barely anybody actually liked. The scores were accurate as of March 2025.Netflix did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment for this story. \"The Electric State\" (2025)Millie Bobby Brown in \"The Electric State.\"NetflixUpon its release on March 14, \"The Electric State\" became a flop with both critics and audiences — it has a 15% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 2.1 stars on Letterboxd.Unfortunately for Netflix (and its directors, the Russo brothers), this movie cost a whopping $320 million to produce, per Deadline, making it the most expensive Netflix movie of all time.The film, based on the graphic novel of the same name, takes place in a dystopian version of the '90s, a past in which there's been a world-leveling war between robots and humans. Millie Bobby Brown stars as Michelle, a teenager who teams up with Keats (Chris Pratt), a veteran, to take down the mega-corporation controlling the world.As The New York Times' Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote, it's \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb.\"\"Red Notice\" (2021)Dwayne Johnson in \"Red Notice.\"NetflixUntil \"The Electric State,\" \"Red Notice\" had been tied for Netflix's most expensive film, with a budget at somewhere near $200 million, reported Variety.That investment didn't pay off with acclaim. The international spy caper has a 37% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 2.5 average rating on Letterboxd. However, according to the streamer, it's Netflix's most-watched original film, with almost 231 million views.\"Red Notice\" stars Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot as a trio on the hunt for a stolen artifact (a bejeweled egg) — Gadot as the thief, Johnson as an Interpol agent, and Reynolds as another thief who's been roped into working with Interpol to save his own skin.However, there are so many twists, turns, and double-crosses that this film becomes impossible to follow.\"'Red Notice' is limp and dull and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma,\" wrote Richard Lawson for Vanity Fair.\"Back in Action\" (2025)Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx in \"Back in Action.\"John Wilson/Netflix\"Back in Action\" was touted as Cameron Diaz's big return to movies after an 11-year break, as well as something of a comeback for Jamie Foxx after having a stroke in 2023.Unfortunately for them, this movie simply isn't very good, with a 2.4 average rating on Letterboxd and a 29% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes (and a 58% audience score, which is saying something). And unfortunately for Netflix, it cost upward of $200 million to produce, per Forbes.The story follows married couple Matt (Foxx) and Emily (Diaz), former CIA operatives who are dragged, well, back into action after one of their former enemies spots them in the background of a video of a bar brawl.\"While it might prove that Diaz still possesses that same particular magic, it also shows that she should be far more discerning with how she chooses to share it,\" wrote The Guardian's Benjamin Lee.\"The Gray Man\" (2022)Ryan Gosling in \"The Gray Man.\"Netflix\"The Electric State\" is the Russo brothers' follow-up to \"The Gray Man,\" a spy thriller starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, and Billy Bob Thornton, that was similarly dinged for being a soulless piece of content — and had a similarly eye-wateringly high budget of $200 million (according to Screen Rant).\"The film exists to set up sequels, to spend money on fancy location shoots, and to look glamorous and exciting; every harder edge has been sanded down to nothing,\" wrote The Atlantic's David Sims.Even though it had a middling response from critics (45% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (average of 2.8 stars on Letterboxd), Courtland Gentry (Gosling) and his band of gray men are set to return in a sequel at some point.\"Heart of Stone\" (2023)Gal Gadot in \"Heart of Stone.\"Chris Baker/Netflix\"Heart of Stone\" stars Gal Gadot as Stone, an operative for a mysterious organization called Charter who is tasked with protecting a powerful AI known as the Heart. There's so much else going on, but it becomes nonsensical pretty quickly.This film, which cost around $150 million to produce, earned a 31% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 2.2 stars on Letterboxd.Stephanie Zacharek of Time called this film \"a 'Mission: Impossible' wannabe that mostly misses.\"The \"Rebel Moon\" franchise (2023-2024)Sofia Boutella in \"Rebel Moon.\"NetflixThe first \"Rebel Moon\" film, \"A Child of Fire,\" has a 22% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes, while its sequel, \"The Scargiver,\" fared even worse with a 16%. They have an average of 2 and 1.9 stars on Letterboxd, respectively.Director Zack Snyder certainly received a blank check for this series, which cannot be adequately explained in a few sentences. At its most basic, it stars Sofia Boutella as a Luke Skywalker-esque figure who turns against her adopted father and is on a quest to save the galaxy.Screen Rant reported the two films had a combined budget of $166 million — not great for movies that Richard Roeper called \"a ponderous slog.\"\"Me Time\" (2022)Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg in \"Me Time.\"NetflixPer IMDb, the budget for the buddy comedy \"Me Time\" was $80 million. But there's no reason for this movie to cost more than the entire GDP of Tuvalu. It's simply about two estranged best friends reconnecting.At 7% on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 2 stars on Letterboxd, this is one of the most-hated films on this list. TheWrap's William Bibbiani summed it up nicely when he wrote that it \"takes all the 'fun' out of 'perfunctory.'\"\"Atlas\" (2024)Jennifer Lopez in \"Atlas.\"NetflixJennifer Lopez has starred in a few streaming films, but her 2024 offering \"Atlas\" is the most disliked by critics and audiences. It reportedly cost a whopping $100 million to make.In \"Atlas,\" Lopez plays an astronaut who hates AI, but is forced to work with her ship's AI interface, Smith, to save humanity. Confused? So are we.The film earned a 19% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, with Empire Magazine's Helen O'Hara writing, \"Lopez throws everything at this, but even major movie-star charisma can't make up for the recycled story elements, tired exposition and endless psycho-babble.\" Letterboxd users felt similarly, with the film earning an average of two stars.\"Bright\" (2017)Will Smith and Joel Edgerton in \"Bright.\"Netflix\"Bright\" was one of Netflix's first big original movies, with a Forbes-reported budget of $90 million. That also made it one of Netflix's first big critical bombs, with a score of 26% on Rotten Tomatoes and tons of discourse about the streamer's plans to continue producing original content. Indiewire's David Ehrlich called it \"the worst film of 2017.\"The film stars Will Smith as an LAPD officer in a world where fantasy creatures like elves and orcs coexist with humans. There is a world where this could've been an interesting movie … but it's not the world we live in. Viewers agreed, with \"Bright\" earning an average rating of 2.3 stars on Letterboxd.\"Damsel\" (2024)Millie Bobby Brown in \"Damsel.\"NetflixIt all comes full circle, as another of Netflix's big-budget flops also starred Millie Bobby Brown, just like \"The Electric State\": the 2024 fantasy-action film \"Damsel,\" in which Brown plays a princess who is forced to save herself from a fire-breathing dragon, instead of waiting for a handsome prince.With a 56% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 2.5 stars on Letterboxd, \"Damsel\" isn't the most hated film on this list, but it's certainly not beloved.\"Rather than being any particular person's bright idea for a girlboss fantasy revenge caper, this lousy romp was obviously hatched by an algorithm, and might just as well have been directed by AI,\" wrote Tim Robey for The Telegraph, who also called it \"atrocious.\"Perhaps that would sting a little less if the film hadn't cost at least $60 million to make, per Yahoo.Read the original article on Business Insider Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle in \"The Electric State.\"Paul Abell/NetflixLike any other studio, Netflix has produced some hits and some stinkers.But in recent years, it seems Netflix has been throwing more and more money at subpar action films.Its latest release, \"The Electric State,\" cost $320 million to make, and barely anyone likes it.This month, Netflix released its most expensive movie yet, \"The Electric State,\" which reportedly cost at least $320 million to make.That puts it in the top 15 most expensive movies of all time, unadjusted for inflation — and, somehow, it doesn't seem",

Director Carl Erik Rinsch was arrested on wire fraud and money laundering charges.John Sciulli/Getty Images for Team One, Saatchi LACarl Erik Rinsch was charged with scamming Netflix out of $11 million for a TV show.He made cryptocurrency investments and used the profits to buy luxury items, prosecutors said.Rinsch faces up to 90 years in prison on federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering.Hollywood director-writer Carl Erik Rinsch has been charged with scamming Netflix out of $11 million, sinking the stolen funds into cryptocurrency, and using the profits for a wild spending spree that included the purchase of five Rolls-Royces.Rinsch, the director behind the 2013 film \"47 Ronin,\" was arrested on Tuesday in California on federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering in connection to the alleged scheme to defraud the streaming behemoth. He faces a maximum sentence of 90 years behind bars.Here's how prosecutors allege, in a 12-page indictment filed in Manhattan federal court, that the filmmaker swindled millions of dollars from Netflix.Prosecutors say the director ripped off Netflix.Mario Tama/Getty ImagesNetflix, only identified in the indictment as \"Streaming Company-1,\" had paid Rinsch $44 million between 2018 and 2019 for an unfinished sci-fi TV show called \"White Horse,\" prosecutors say.Under Rinsch's agreement with Netflix, he was to complete the show, which was about a scientist who created a group of super-intelligent clones, according to the court documents.In March of 2020, Netflix forked over another $11 million to Rinsch after he demanded more money to complete the show, the indictment says.Prosecutors say that Rinsch \"almost immediately\" transferred that extra money from his namesake company to his personal accounts.Rinsch then made several \"extremely risky\" purchases of securities, including call options on a biopharmaceutical company, and lost more than half of the $11 million in less than two months due to his unsuccessful trades, the indictment says.While Rinsch was losing most of the $11 million intended to complete \"White Horse,\" he lied to Netflix, saying that the show was \"awesome and moving forward really well,\" according to prosecutors.Prosecutors say that in 2021 Rinsch transferred what was left of the money to a cryptocurrency exchange account where his luck turned around.Rinsch \"used those funds to speculate on cryptocurrency — which eventually proved profitable,\" the indictment says. Buying Dogecoin, which Elon Musk has called one of his favorite cryptocurrencies, helped Rinsch turn $4 million into nearly $27 million, The New York Times reported in 2023.The filmmaker then transferred his profits to another personal bank account before spending $10 million on luxury goods and other expenses, according to prosecutors.Rinsch spent about $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, $652,000 on watches and clothing, $638,000 on two mattresses, $295,000 on bedding and linens, $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, $1.8 million on credit card bills, and another $1 million on lawyers to sue Netflix \"for even more money,\" the indictment says.Prosecutors say Rinsch never completed \"White Horse\" and never returned the stolen money to Netflix.An attorney for Rinsch did not return a request for comment by Business Insider on Wednesday. Netflix declined to comment.Last year, an arbitrator sided with Netflix and ruled that Rinsch owed it $8.8 million in damages.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "In 2021, Netflix’s executive vice president of game development Mike Verdu made a big announcement: “Let the Games Begin.” Four years later, Verdu is out—and Netflix’s grand experiment in gaming still feels like a work in progress. Netflix bet big on gaming. They brought in Verdu from Facebook and EA, and then went on a buying spree, acquiring a handful of mobile gaming studios like Boss Fight and Night School. But, by the end of 2022, only about 1% of the Netflix subscribers were actually playing its games. At the time, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that gaming had “a bunch of positives” even if growth was slow: “These are small numbers, we’re good with that.” (Netflix declined Fast Company‘s request for comment.) But, after years of stalled development and only a handful of successes, Netflix is pivoting. They’ve canned multiple games that were in development, and gutted entire departments like experimental video. Netflix is, once more, recalibrating its approach The stunted rise of Netflix gaming Gaming looked like Netflix’s next big frontier. The interactive Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was a hit—despite a prolonged legal battle Netflix eventually settled. At the time, The Verge called Netflix’s gaming push the company’s “secret sauce for continued domination.” They started to buy up major game developers, and even built an in-house studio for themselves. This initial voyage had its snags. Their rollout of games varied between different devices. The initial crop, which included two Stranger Things-themed games, was available on Android only. Netflix teased that iOS support was “on the way,” frustrating Apple users. And, since Apple bars third-party apps from operating as its own gaming market, Netflix’s iOS rollout demanded users download their games as stand-alone applications. It took two more years for Netflix to open up gaming availability on TVs. While Netflix started by releasing a variety of themed and original games, they quickly leaned hard into IP. In 2023, Sarandos pointed to a gaming adaptation of reality show Too Hot To Handle as a major success. That game has since been given two sequels. They’ve also released gaming spin-offs of shows like Love Is Blind and The Queen’s Gambit. To date, their most successful game is an adaptation of Squid Game. Then came the cuts. Netflix built an internal AAA studio (codenamed “Blue”)—but reportedly shut it down in 2024 before releasing a single title. The company then delisted almost all of their interactive titles. Bandersnatch, once a beacon of hope, is now one of the last of its type remaining. In January, Netflix shelved six upcoming games. Verdu, once the leader of this new department, took on a new title of “VP of GenAI for gaming,” before leaving the company entirely. Can Netflix pivot? Netflix’s gaming division isn’t dead—but it’s entering yet another reboot. In 2024, just before Verdu transitioned to his AI-focused role, Netflix announced a new hire. Alain Tascan of Epic Games joined as a new president of games. Tascan is now making changes to his team internally. They’ve also pivoted away from a mobile-first approach, now opening up the possibility of cloud gaming on smart TVs. Netflix has also had some recent successes that suggest possible longevity. Squid Game: Unleashed, which was released with season two of the hit drama show, racked up 42 million plays by the end of 2024. Netflix touts that Unleashed was the “#1 Free Action Game in 57 Countries.” The WWE mobile games will also be exclusively available through Netflix in fall 2025 with their content deal. After years of slow starts and sharp pivots, Netflix still hasn’t proven games belong in its subscription model. The next few years will test whether Tascan can turn things around.",

Ashley and Grant went on Netflix's first season of \"Temptation Island\" to mend their trust issues.Instead, they found new lovers. And it seems that Ashley could still be with her new beau, Danny.Losing your partner is the risk contestants take when they sign up for the dating show, where couples are separated and taken to live with singles who try to seduce them.On this season, which is Netflix's first, four couples are featured, including Ashley and Grant. Ashley says on the show that Grant cheated on her a month into their relationship.\"Over time, it's just built up into this huge mess of mistrust and resentment, and I think if we can get through this, maybe it will clear that up,\" Grant says.Grant says he wants to prove to Ashley and his daughter from a previous relationship that he can keep his word and resist temptation.Grant cheats on Ashley, so she starts dating two other men.Grant and Natalie date for a majority of the season.Courtesy of NetflixAshley and Grant stay committed to each other in the first few days of the process.But in the first of the show's bonfires in episode two, where contestants are shown what their partners have been up to, Grant sees a clip of Ashley complaining about his behavior and saying she's \"never going to trust him.\"Grant says this hurts him, and he gets closer to Natalie, one of the single contestants. By the end of episode three, Grant and Natalie kiss, and have sex in a shower in the following episode.At the episode five bonfire, Ashley says she feels \"relief\" after seeing the videos of Grant cheating.\"I think I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for the proof,\" Ashley says.Grant initially regrets cheating. But after he sees another clip of Ashley bad-mouthing him at the bonfire, he deepens his relationship with Natalie when he returns to the villa.At the same time, Ashley announces that she's single and starts to properly pursue Logan and Danny. As the show continues, she gets closer to Danny, eventually kissing him off-camera in episode six.When Grant and Ashley reunite during the season one finale, he says he wants to leave the show alone, seemingly splitting up with Ashley and Natalie. Meanwhile, Ashley leaves the show in a relationship with Danny. Ashley and Danny may still be dating, while it seems Grant and Natalie are over. Danny and Ashley on one of their dates in \"Temptation Island.\"Courtesy of NetflixIt seems likely Ashley and Danny are still together The finale aired a week ago, but none of the couples have publicly confirmed their relationship status.

Ashley and Grant went on Netflix's first season of \"Temptation Island\" to mend their trust issues.Instead, they found new lovers. And it seems that Ashley could still be with her new beau, Danny.Losing your partner is the risk contestants take when they sign up for the dating show, where couples are separated and taken to live with singles who try to seduce them.On this season, which is Netflix's first, four couples are featured, including Ashley and Grant. Ashley says on the show that Grant cheated on her a month into their relationship.\"Over time, it's just built up into this huge mess of mistrust and resentment, and I think if we can get through this, maybe it will clear that up,\" Grant says.Grant says he wants to prove to Ashley and his daughter from a previous relationship that he can keep his word and resist temptation.Grant cheats on Ashley, so she starts dating two other men.Grant and Natalie date for a majority of the season.Courtesy of NetflixAshley and Grant stay committed to each other in the first few days of the process.But in the first of the show's bonfires in episode two, where contestants are shown what their partners have been up to, Grant sees a clip of Ashley complaining about his behavior and saying she's \"never going to trust him.\"Grant says this hurts him, and he gets closer to Natalie, one of the single contestants. By the end of episode three, Grant and Natalie kiss, and have sex in a shower in the following episode.At the episode five bonfire, Ashley says she feels \"relief\" after seeing the videos of Grant cheating.\"I think I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for the proof,\" Ashley says.Grant initially regrets cheating. But after he sees another clip of Ashley bad-mouthing him at the bonfire, he deepens his relationship with Natalie when he returns to the villa.At the same time, Ashley announces that she's single and starts to properly pursue Logan and Danny. As the show continues, she gets closer to Danny, eventually kissing him off-camera in episode six.When Grant and Ashley reunite during the season one finale, he says he wants to leave the show alone, seemingly splitting up with Ashley and Natalie. Meanwhile, Ashley leaves the show in a relationship with Danny. Ashley and Danny may still be dating, while it seems Grant and Natalie are over.

The recipe seemed ideal for people who want to feed an entire family with little to no time to prepare dinner.Here's how to make Meghan Markle's one-pot pasta.I started by gathering the ingredients for the one-pot pasta.The recipe calls for fresh greens, lemon, and cheese.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderFor this recipe you'll need:2 cloves garlic1 pint plum tomatoes¼ cup olive oilZest of 1 lemonA box of spaghetti3 ½ cups of waterSwiss chardKale¼ cup Parmigiano Reggiano cheeseRed pepper flakesMeghan doesn't list any exact measurements in the scene, other than how much water she uses, so I estimated how much to use of each ingredient.I spent $28.10, excluding tax, on ingredients at my local grocery store in Brooklyn, New York.I chopped the tomatoes in half and added them to my skillet.I chopped my plum tomatoes on a wooden cutting board.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderMeghan said this doesn't need to be precise and that you can use whatever tomatoes you have on hand, from a mix of red or yellow plum tomatoes or more exotic varieties like heirlooms.I added the tomatoes to my skillet with chopped garlic and olive oil.I seasoned the garlic and tomatoes with salt.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderAt this point, you keep the stovetop off — when Meghan is making it, she does these steps while the pan is on the countertop.After adding the olive oil and tomatoes to the pan, I sprinkled the entire skillet with salt. I then added the chopped garlic and mixed it with a wooden spoon.I then added about a box of spaghetti to the pan.I added the spaghetti to the pot and zested a whole lemon over it.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderPart of what makes this pasta dish especially easy to make is that you don't need to boil the pasta in a separate pot. Instead, the pasta water comes together with the other ingredients to cook the pasta and make the sauce.I zested a whole lemon over the pasta noodles and then started boiling my water in a tea kettle.It took about 3 cups of water to cover the pasta and tomatoes. Then, I covered the skillet with a lid.I covered the skillet with a lid and let the pasta continue cooking.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderIn the show, Meghan said to cover the spaghetti with water, which she said takes about 3 ½ cups. However, the amount you use will depend on the size of your skillet.Even though the water was fully boiled when I added it, I noticed that it wasn't hot enough to cook the pasta fully since the entire dish had to be brought to a boil.I turned the heat on my stove to medium-high and let the pasta boil for about five minutes.While the pasta was cooking, I chopped the Swiss chard.I chopped up the Swiss chard, including the stems.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderMeghan doesn't say exactly how much she uses, but I ended up using about three stems. She recommends chopping the red part of the stem for added color and flavor, as well as the leaves.When the pasta was fully brought to a boil, I lowered the heat and added in the greens.I added the Swiss chard and kale to the pot.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderI tried to separate the spaghetti noodles using a wooden spoon but found that they initially stuck together. However, as the pasta continued cooking, they eventually separated.I also added the chopped Swiss chard and a couple of handfuls of massaged kale, which I tore apart with my hands and added directly to the pot.I mixed the pasta with the greens and let it cook for a few more minutes on low heat.I continued cooking the pasta on low heat for a few minutes.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderMeghan said the starch from the pasta would create a \"creamy\" sauce without the need for cream. Even after letting it all cook down for a few minutes, I thought it still appeared pretty watery.After I added the grated Parmigiano Reggiano, the sauce started to come together.The pasta came together when I added the grated cheese.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderThe blistered tomatoes and cheese made the sauce slightly thicker and a light-orange color. The pasta noodles were also perfectly al-dente.I topped the dish with a pinch of fresh salt and red pepper flakes, per Meghan's suggestion.I was really impressed by the final result, and by how easy it was to make.The finished result was a light and flavorful weeknight meal.Erin McDowell/Business InsiderI love having a one-pot recipe on hand, especially during a busy workweek. This pasta dish made for a quick, healthy dinner.The lemon and slightly blistered plum tomatoes added flavor, while the red pepper flakes added a kick — I was surprised Meghan and Harry's kids would be into it. It tasted light and fresh, and I thought the Swiss chard and kale added texture.However, it was far from the most flavorful or decadent pasta dish I've ever had.Still, it was also unbelievably quick and easy to make, and even easier to clean up.I could see myself adding this recipe into my weekly rotation for a quick dinner, though I'm not sure I would make it for a dinner party or when I'm really wanting to impress someone with my culinary prowess.Read the original article on Business Insider Meghan Markle's one-pot spaghetti, as shown during her Netflix series \"With Love, Meghan,\" takes less than 20 minutes to make.Chris Jackson/Getty Images; Erin McDowell/Business InsiderI made Meghan Markle's one-pot spaghetti from her Netflix series \"With Love, Meghan.\"The pasta dish is made in a skillet using boiled water, tomatoes, and two different types of greens.The final dish lacked rich flavor, but it was tasty and shockingly easy to make.Meghan Markle's one-pot pasta recipe has sparked mixed reactions online.However, for those short on time and in need of a quick, easy meal, I thought the simple pasta dish fit the bill.In the first episode of Meghan's new Netflix series \"With Love, Meghan,\" the duchess walks her friend and makeup artist Daniel Martin through one of her go-to dinners, which she calls her single-skillet spaghetti.The \"family favorite\" pasta recipe — yes, even her and Prince Harry's kids supposedly love it — uses spaghetti, Swiss chard, kale, baby tomatoes, and grated Parmesan cheese.It has received criticism online, with some outlets calling the finished product \"bland\" and others comparing it to similar recipes already in existence.While the dish is by no means packed with rich, creamy flavor, I did think the tomatoes, cheese, and red pepper flakes did a lot of heavy lifting to add flavor.The pasta took under 20 minutes to make and used one pot, which saved me time cleaning up.

[…] The post Cloud Computing: From Fuzzy Diagrams to Business Backbone appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Whether you’re streaming a movie on Netflix, collaborating with co-workers on a project, or running an artificial intelligence (AI) model, most likely you’re using cloud computing. Cloud computing is how many businesses and individuals today store, process and manage data. But what exactly is cloud computing, how does it work and why is it important? Cloud computing is the delivery over the internet of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software and analytics for users to access. This means users don’t need to own and maintain their IT hardware and software. Remember the days when you used to buy Microsoft Office software in a box and then store it on your computer? When you leave the office, you can’t access your Word or Excel documents. On a company-wide scale, businesses do the same thing. They own and manage software and hardware (such as servers, which are computers that serve data, applications and services) containing their data in their own data centers. This is what’s called “on premises” or “on prem” as a slang. For many companies, it’s easier and sometimes cheaper to put their data in the data centers of major cloud providers, use their software and hardware, and access company information and applications through the internet. The biggest cloud providers globally are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. In Asia, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and Huawei Cloud also dominate. These hyperscalers operate data centers that span thousands to over 1 million square feet, housing thousands of servers that store data and run applications on behalf of their customers. Read more: Unlocking Potential, Managing Risk: The Cloud AI Conundrum How Cloud Computing Works The term cloud computing came about when engineers used to diagram their corporate networks, they would loosely sketch a cloud-like shape to represent unknown networks they connect to, like the internet. Today, cloud computing is multi-billion-dollar industry. It works through a network of data centers that process and store data. Users interact with cloud-based platforms through web browsers like Chrome or applications. For example, when someone edits a document in Google Docs, their work is saved on Google’s cloud servers rather than their own hard drive on their computer. Similarly, when businesses use platforms like Salesforce, customer data is processed and managed in the cloud rather than on company-owned servers. This means cloud computing serves users on demand. Users can request computing power, storage or applications as needed, without having to worry about maintaining the necessary hardware and software. This feature lets businesses adapt to market changes quickly — such as scaling up on Black Friday when website traffic explodes for online shopping — without having to buy additional servers and maintain them. Per Google Cloud, there are three main types of cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. Public cloud: This is the most common model used, where services are delivered over the internet. They are owned by third-party providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Private cloud: This is a company’s own infrastructure house in their own data centers. Companies, especially those in highly regulated industries like finance and health care, prefer to be “on prem” to have control over their own data. Hybrid cloud: This is a mix of public and private clouds. A company can put some data and applications in the public cloud and maintain control over more critical data in their own data centers. A company doesn’t have to stick to just one cloud computing company. To avoid being stuck if a cloud provider goes offline, as many as 90% of companies opt to use multiple cloud providers. This avoids reliance on a single vendor and optimizes performance. Cloud providers rent out three types of services: Infrastructure (servers and storage), platform (framework) and software (applications). In the industry, these services are called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). AI workloads — computational tasks involved in developing, training, deploying and running AI models — use all three types. Infrastructure — AI workloads rent thousands of GPUs and servers at data centers to power their training. Platform — AI workloads harness pre-configured platforms to build, test and deploy, simplifying app development. Software — AI workloads rent the software it needs to build and train AI models and develop applications in the cloud. Read more: Amazon Debuts AWS Data Transfer Terminals For Faster Cloud Uploads Business Benefits and Risks of Cloud Computing An ISACA blog post details the pros and cons of cloud computing. Likewise, Google Cloud explores the benefits and risks. Here are the benefits: Cost Savings: Cloud computing reduces IT expenses by eliminating the need for costly hardware and maintenance. Businesses only pay for the resources they use. Scalability: Cloud platforms allow businesses to quickly scale up resources during peak demand and scale down when demand decreases. Remote Access: With cloud computing, users can access files, applications, and systems from anywhere, enabling remote work and collaboration. Security and reliability: Major cloud providers such as the tech giants can better provide advanced security measures, such as encryption and automated backups rather than a company’s IT department. Automatic updates: Cloud providers handle software updates and maintenance, freeing IT departments from this burden. And the risks: Data security: Storing sensitive information in the cloud can make it vulnerable to cyberattacks. Organizations must ensure their cloud provider complies with security regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Outages: Cloud services can experience outages, disrupting business operations. Companies must have backup plans in place. Vendor lock-in: Switching cloud providers can be complex and costly, leading to dependence on a single vendor. Compliance and legal Issues: Organizations must ensure their cloud provider meets industry-specific compliance standards.

        "description": "A little over a decade ago, Netflix decided to take streaming into its own hands: Instead of relying on commercial content delivery services, the streamer built its own servers from scratch, and gave them away to internet service providers. Since then, Netflix has distributed over 18,000 of these servers, now installed in 6,000 locations spread across 175 countries, forming the company’s Open Connect content delivery network. Now, Netflix is ready to take this tech beyond movies and TV shows: The company has begun to develop its own cloud gaming infrastructure, with servers that could eventually allow any Netflix member to play complex games on their smart TVs without an expensive game console. This kind of cloud gaming requires a whole new generation of Open Connect servers. “The appliances that are going to stream games will need to look different,” says Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone. “That’s something that we’re building now.” Netflix’s servers have improved by 40x Netflix began working on Open Connect in 2011, and placed a first set of servers in the data centers of select U.S.-based internet providers in 2012. At the time, Netflix engineers taped a different movie quote on each custom-built, bright red Open Connect server. The concept behind Open Connect has stayed pretty much the same ever since: Once a server gets installed in an internet provider’s local data center, it gets loaded up with copies of Netflix’s movies and shows, which are then streamed to the provider’s customers whenever they’re ready to watch something. “When you click play, the content is coming from around the corner,” Stone explains. That allows Netflix to deliver movies faster and more reliably, while also reducing congestion for upstream pipes that connect a service provider to the internet at large—a win-win for everyone involved. These days, the movie quotes are long gone, as are the red chassis housings. The technology itself has changed as well: Netflix server racks now incorporate both machines with fast flash drives that stream Netflix’s most popular fare, as well as massive hard drive clusters to store thousands of additional movies and shows for customers with more eclectic taste. “One half-rack of our servers serves all of Netflix’s catalog,” Stone says. “It can serve about 500,000 simultaneous streams. When we first got started, this half-rack could only serve about 13,000 simultaneous streams.” Video games are a different beast Open Connect’s next challenge is Netflix’s budding video game business. The company has launched more than 120 mobile games since it began exploring gaming in 2021, but its ambitions reach far beyond mobile: Netflix ultimately wants to allow its subscribers to access games comparable to what’s available on Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation directly from the Netflix app running on a regular smart TV. To do this, Netflix has begun to build its own cloud gaming service, which it is currently testing with a subset of its subscribers in eight countries, including the U.S. and Canada. Subscribers in the beta test get to play around a dozen titles, including the indie game hit Oxenfree and the rebooted Atari classic Centipede: Recharged. This trial run helps Netflix test its cloud gaming technology, and optimize the design of its new Open Connect game servers. These appliances are very different from Netflix’s existing streaming hardware. “If you are streaming games to the TV, you execute the game on a server,” Stone explains. The server then captures a live video feed of the game and beams it to the consumer’s TV. That requires Netflix’s game servers to be optimized for real-time graphics rendering. “More GPU-heavy, different types of chips, and a different type of design,” Stone says. Cloud games also need to be delivered with as little latency as possible so that players don’t miss a critical jump or turn due to a delayed stream. For some games, synchronization across locations is also needed to allow Netflix subscribers to play together remotely. “Cloud games tend to be pretty social, in many cases,” Stone says. Stone readily admits Netflix’s current cloud gaming test is small. “As we feel more confident in our approach, we [will] start to scale to other countries and other game types,” she says. “That will come in the coming years.” The Tyson-Paul disaster helped future-proof Open Connect Getting a new technology like cloud gaming right can be challenging, especially for a company the size of Netflix; opening up the service too early to all of its 300 million subscribers could easily overwhelm the company’s infrastructure. Netflix did get a lesson in humility last year when it aggressively expanded into livestreaming—only to have the broadcast of a match between boxing legend Mike Tyson and YouTube star Logan Paul turn into a train wreck. “Everything about Tyson-Paul was extraordinary, including how large that event was,” Stone says. An estimated 65 million viewers tuned in simultaneously, overwhelming even Netflix’s content delivery network. The result: widespread buffering, and some users being kicked from the stream entirely. Stone describes the experience as a painful but necessary lesson. “For that fight, there was no way to simulate that in a lab,” she says. The insights her team gained from that knockout not only helped Netflix successfully stream two NFL games over the holidays, but are helping make Open Connect more resilient for whatever comes next, from live sports to cloud gaming. “Our aspirations are much larger than 300 million members,” Stone says. “In order to stream film and TV to 400 million members, 500 million members all around the world, we need Open Connect to continue to evolve.”",

One critic called it \"a monumental disaster.\"Netflix reportedly shelled out hundreds of millions for their new film, \"The Electric State,\" but its return on investment isn't looking very promising.\"The Electric State,\" released on Friday, is a retro-futuristic movie set in the '90s. It stars Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle, an orphaned teen who goes on a journey in search of her long-lost brother, Christopher, after a robot rebellion. She's joined on the journey by a smuggler named Keats (Chris Pratt) and his sidekick, a robot named Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie).The sci-fi movie is directed by sibling filmmaking duo Joe and Anthony Russo, who got their start as directors and producers on the TV shows \"Arrested Development\" and \"Community\" before graduating to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.With two well-known stars as the faces of the movie, a thriving duo directing, and a bunch of celebrity cameos, \"The Electric State\" seemed ripe for success — on paper, at least.As of publication, the film has a critics score of 17% from 69 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, suggesting Netflix might have miscalculated its latest big swing.'The Electric State' reportedly had a budget of $300 million to $320 millionMillie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, and Ke Huy Quan in \"The Electric State.\"Paul Abell/NetflixIn May 2024, Puck News reported that the movie's budget at a \"traditional studio\" would probably have been less than $200 million. But at Netflix, it reportedly could have ended up around $300 million.More recently, Deadline and Total Film reported \"The Electric State\" budget as even higher — $320 million, which, if true, would make it one of the most expensive movies ever made. To further put it into context, the reported budgets for the 10 most recent Oscar winners for best picture collectively amount to under $230 million, which is still much less than \"The Electric State.\"It's not unheard of for a Russo brothers movie to have a big budget, though. The duo directed Marvel's \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" which was a critical and commercial success, earning $714 million globally on a reported $170 million budget. They've since directed three more ensemble Marvel films: \"Captain America: Civil War,\" \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" and \"Avengers: Endgame.\"\"Infinity War\" and \"Endgame\" are two of the highest-grossing films of all time, with both crossing $2 billion at the global box office.However, the duo has found success outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), particularly on streaming services, more difficult to achieve.Their 2022 action movie \"The Gray Man,\" starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, received middling reviews and a 45% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. It reportedly cost $200 million to make.The Russo brothers' spy series \"Citadel,\" starring Priyanka Chopra and Richard Madden, reportedly cost $300 million to make and scored an early renewal before the first season debuted on Prime Video. Two spin-offs have since premiered, but the \"Citadel\" universe hasn't prompted much buzz.Reviews of 'The Electric State' are overwhelmingly negative, calling it a waste of moneyMillie Bobby Brown as Michelle in \"The Electric State.\"NetflixThe movie is inspired by Simon Stålenhag's 2018 illustrated novel of the same name. To call it based on the novel would be a stretch, though, as the movie completely revamps elements of the book.Instead, critics have called it \"derivative\" and \"soulless,\" with \"mind-numbingly repetitive\" action scenes. Brown and Pratt, who have delivered impressive performances in \"Stranger Things\" and the MCU, respectively, fail to bring a spark to \"The Electric State.\"Dylan Roth of The Observer deemed it \"a dumb, unfunny action movie for children,\" and the latest victim in the trend of \"unfathomably expensive streaming titles that feel like they were designed by an algorithm and assembled in a factory.\"It's hard to know how exactly Netflix quantifies success. Is topping the weekly top 10 during the premiere week considered a win, even if the movie doesn't have longtail viewership? Or does it need to become one of the streamer's most popular films to be considered a bona fide slam dunk? And how much does social media chatter matter?In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published on Friday, Joe Russo said that \"logically, it probably doesn't make a ton of sense\" for streamers to spend astronomical amounts of money on projects, \"but I think they might — because people still believe in ambition. Executives still believe in ambition.\"\"'The Electric State' is certainly a big test case for this whole thing,\" Anthony Russo said, adding that the filmmakers and the streamer have tried to hype up the film in the way that big theatrical releases generate attention.\"So we'll see how this plays, we'll see what this does for Netflix and we'll see where it all goes,\" he said.Reps for Netflix and the Russo brothers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Read the original article on Business Insider Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle in \"The Electric State.\"Paul Abell/NetflixNetflix's new sci-fi movie \"The Electric State\" reportedly had a budget of $300 to $320 million.Critics are panning the film, which has a 17% score on Rotten Tomatoes as of publication.It's reportedly Netflix's most expensive movie ever.

I could upgrade, though, by paying an extra $10 or more indefinitely for an ad-free plan, which would come with better quality video, the ability to add my account to more devices, and the privilege of watching a show that has aired on basic cable for 50 years.Increasingly, streaming content is subject to tiers and the trend of \"premiumization.\" For years, companies like Netflix, Max, and Disney+ fought the so-called streaming wars — losing money because of pricey content, fierce competition, and high churn rates among users who hopped from platform to platform. But 2024 was the year things turned around. Spotify, Netflix, and Disney+ were all posting profits, finally making investors happy.To keep investors happy, the subscriptions that appear as second thoughts on your credit card statement are still creeping up. Premiumization has long been a driver of tiered spending in the physical world — from airplane seats to airport lounges to Disney World — and now digital streamers are harnessing its power. The price hikes are working because they've got us hooked: Most people who quit Netflix come back, lured by a new cast on \"Love Is Blind\" or some other viral original premiere. Netflix prices went up again in January, Spotify is reportedly considering a new plan that will give users who pay extra more premium content, and Amazon Music has price hikes and more exclusive content in the works, too. Even YouTube TV went up by $10 a month last year, coming to a total of $82.99.As streaming finally matures, our wallets may be the ultimate losers of the streaming wars.Almost any service you try to buy today will offer add-ons. Even discount gyms like Planet Fitness offer tiered plans. What's different about these streaming companies is they were born in an era where they promised us more for less — you could listen to the entire library of Spotify rather than buying each track or album, and say goodbye to those viruses hidden in LimeWire downloads. In 2012, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said he sought to create something \"better than piracy,\" and that the company wanted \"to bring music to every single person and bring it to every moment of their life.\" Netflix gave us not just ways to ditch DVDs and snail mail, but access to its own hit content anywhere, anytime, without any annoying ads (goodbye forever, Geico caveman). They reinvented the way we watched TV and listened to music — streaming was so cheap and flexible that it easily hooked millennials.That's when the streaming wars took off in earnest. Companies scrambled to gobble up existing shows and new talent for their content. Prices were low, and it felt like cinephiles and TV buffs had more control and choice than ever. Streamers advertised themselves as if they cared if we, the watchers, had a good time. On a 2020 call, Netflix's former CEO Reed Hastings said: \"We want to be the safe respite where you can explore, you can get stimulated, have fun and enjoy — and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising.\" Now, that safe haven is only offered to those who shell out more money, as Hastings ate his words and launched a cheaper ad-supported tier for Netflix in 2022. When I was blocked from watching \"SNL,\" the Netflix app blamed licensing agreements, which make a small portion of the content it offers unavailable on the ad-supported tier. As of 2023, Peacock no longer offers the free, ad-supported tier it launched with, and now charges $7.99 a month for its cheapest plan. Max announced in February that it would remove access to Bleacher Report and CNN Max from its basic tier.\"This idea of the good stuff costing a little bit more isn't exactly new,\" says Max Signorelli, the consumer research lead for media and entertainment at the consultancy firm Omdia. \"But certainly, long gone are the times where these relatively new streaming offerings were marketing themselves as the cheap, viable alternative to traditional media sources.\"Today, streamers aren't alternatives to cable; they're the mainstream. Combining subscription and ad revenue was the model that made companies like Verizon and Comcast cable giants. \"A lot of the newer media companies came out of the gate with a tech mindset of: scale first, we'll worry about profits and revenue later,\" Nii Addy, the chief marketing officer at the streaming company Philo, tells me. \"We're at that inflection point where they're having to turn that scale into profits.\" Ironically, they're following in the footsteps of the companies they sought to disrupt. \"A lot of these new media companies are with one hand killing the legacy cash cows, but then they're also nursing their own, and it's based on the exact same model,\" Addy says. What's good about tiered pricing is they give you the choice. It's not like it forces you to be in business class. Z. John Zhang, a professor of marketing at Wharton Netflix had an exceptional 2024, making $39 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from 2023. It celebrated the news and simultaneously announced a price hike: \"We continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix,\" the company said in its January earnings letter. Warner Bros. Discovery, which includes Max, saw its streaming business make $677 million in profit in 2024, up from $103 million the year before. Peacock revenue grew by 46% from 2023 to 2024, coming to $4.9 billion, although it still did not post a profit. Paramount+ says it is on track to reach full-year profitability in 2025.The music streamers have stumbled for even longer, trying to disrupt an industry that was wildly profitable before Napster and LimeWire decimated it. Spotify, which rarely made a profit through 2023, turned itself around 2024 and had its first profitable year. Now, Bloomberg reports the company is considering charging an additional $5.99 for a Music Pro plan on top of premium subscription prices that hit $11.99 a month (which is up from the $9.99 it charged from 2011 until 2023), in hopes of drawing music superfans with perks like higher-quality audio, remixing tools, and access to concert tickets. In the not-so-distant future, premium versions of Taylor Swift songs may be available only to those who can afford it. Spotify declined to confirm the rumored details for this story.The rumors come as the music streaming game is changing; Spotify signed a deal in January with the world's largest music company, Universal Music Group, to advance what is seen as a new streaming 2.0 era in music, driven by more exclusive content and personalization. Amazon Music, too, has expanded its relationship with UMG, announced vague plans to develop exclusive content, and has raised its subscription prices by $1 a month. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. But replacing one price for nearly all the world's music, tiers will separate the superfans from the casual listeners — and some superfans may even subscribe to more than one music streamer if the exclusive offerings start to further differentiate the catalogs of Spotify and Amazon.Ultimately, entertainment tiers might not be such a bad deal for consumers. Z. John Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, says tiered pricing actually does democratize these services. Different pricing levels allow people who want to pay less to do so and still get decent access to content, subsidized by those willing to pay for premiumization. \"What's good about tiered pricing is they give you the choice. It's not like it forces you to be in business class,\" he says. \"For the people who pay the higher price, it's voluntary, they want to. The customers all become better off; they all have their own choice.\"For now, streamers are taking divergent approaches: Some are charging more for add-on content, and others are starting to take perks away from those who pay the least. All of this will likely result in the bottom-tier price being a worse experience across the board. On airplanes, I'll take the smallest seat and forgo water if it's not free. I'll watch ads with my Netflix and Hulu if it means I can justify subscribing to both. If it wants me to pay more each month, Spotify will have to come up with something particularly exclusive and enticing, like a jump on concert tickets, to beat out the bots that plague Ticketmaster. But if more good content goes behind the steeper paywall, it'll be a test to see how long the cheap subscribers like me can hold out.Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

Now Hinchliffe has a Netflix deal.ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesComedian Tony Hinchcliffe's performance at a Donald Trump rally last year was so toxic even Trump tried to disavow it.Now, Hinchcliffe has a four-show deal with Netflix.But don't lump this deal in with other media moves meant to cater to Trump. Netflix has been interested in this kind of comedy for years.Last year, Tony Hinchcliffe performed at a rally for Donald Trump and immediately generated so much blowback that Trump and the Republican Party tried to distance themselves from the comedian.Now, Hinchcliffe has a Netflix deal for four comedy specials. The first one airs in April.Is this another example of the media world bending toward Trump, and/or his supporters, following the election?It's easy to make the connection, and some people are doing that. CNN's Brian Stelter, for example, lumps the Netflix announcement in with Amazon's deals to license old episodes of Trump's \"The Apprentice,\" and to shell out a reported $40 million for a Melania Trump documentary.And to be clear, I'm very concerned about the way Trump 2.0 seems to be interfering with the way media companies operate. It's not hyperbole to say that free speech is under attack.But I don't think that's what's happening here.That's not because I have any behind-the-scenes reporting about the deal. (I asked a Netflix rep if they wanted to comment on the specials and they seemed legitimately confused about the question.) It's simply because I've seen Netflix embrace Hinchcliffe — and, more broadly, the style of deliberately transgressive comedy he works in — for years.Last spring, for instance, Hinchcliffe was a featured performer at the streamer's LA-based comedy festival. More important, he was also featured in Netflix's \"Roast of Tom Brady.\" Sample joke: \"Tom Brady — why do you look like a gay Tom Brady?\"Your mileage may vary with that kind of humor. But it's important to note that the context it was delivered in — a roast, where you're expected to say terrible things about the person you're roasting, right in front of them. That's a Hinchcliffe specialty. And the stuff Hinchcliffe said at the Trump rally last fall — specifically, the part about Puerto Rico being a \"floating island of garbage\" — wouldn't raise an eye in a roast setting.More broadly: Netflix has invested heavily in comedy programming for years. And that some of that programming — but certainly not all of it — has been in the \"you liberals think I can't say this but watch me say it right now\" school of comedy.The most prominent example of that is Dave Chappelle, who has received an enormous amount of money for his Netflix specials, which often showcase his ongoing battles with the trans community. \"The Closer,\" Chapelle's 2021 Netflix special, drew particular criticism from trans advocates in and outside the company. In response, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos defended Chapelle, told employees that his comedy was \"an important part of our content offering,\" and has continued to produce more Chapelle specials.Just as telling: In 2022, Netflix changed its publicly published HR guidelines, underscoring that it supported artistic expression, even if some of what it distributes \"run[s] counter to our personal values.\" And if employees have a problem with that? \"Netflix is probably not the best place for you,\" the company said.In hindsight, it is interesting to watch Netflix lean into programming that could upset its original coastal elite fan base and workforce years before Trump won his second election. Maybe there's a lesson there for Democrats trying to rethink their approach.Or maybe it's just basic math: Netflix's valuation is based on the premise that hundreds of millions of people will subscribe to it, which means it has to appeal to all kinds of tastes and views.But in any case, I don't think you can chalk this one, at least, up to the current occupant of the White House.Read the original article on Business Insider Tony Hinchcliffe's performance at Donald Trump's October 2024 rally at Madison Square Garden — the one where he called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" — was considered so toxic that Trump tried to distance himself from the comedian.

        "description": "Sara and Ben on \"Love Is Blind\" season 8.NetflixAll episodes of \"Love Is Blind\" season eight are available on Netflix.The season focuses on five couples who get engaged and two more couples who do not make it to engagement.Here's what happened to each of them.Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight finale.\"Love Is Blind\" season eight yielded four weddings but only one actual marriage.On Friday, Netflix released the wedding episode for the newest season of \"Love Is Blind,\" the streamer's most popular unscripted show. While the show, which premiered in 2020, has been a major success for Netflix, it's been less successful in helping people find their perfect matches — only 10 \"Love Is Blind\" couples are still together from the show's first seven seasons.A reunion episode, where the cast returns to give updates on their relationship status, premieres on Sunday, which could add more twists to the season.But for now, here's what we know about each of the main couples of this season as of the finale.Dave and LaurenDave and Lauren did not make it to the altar.Courtesy of NetflixIn the pod stage, Dave connected with multiple women but proposed to Lauren.However, when they get home and get their phones back, Dave hears from his friends and sister that Lauren has a secret boyfriend. When confronted, Lauren claims she and the unnamed man were hooking up but were never in a real relationship.Dave struggles to believe Lauren, refuses to let her meet his friends and family, and eventually breaks up with her in episode 11. Later in the episode, they both attend a cast party, and he apologizes to Lauren for letting his \"ego\" ruin their relationship and hints he might want to rekindle things. Lauren makes clear she has no interest in reuniting.As far as we know, there are no signs that the pair get back together.Ben and SaraSara and Ben do not get married on the show.Courtesy of NetflixBen and Sara faced several trials on their journey to the altar.Ben is a Christian, and Sara doesn't like his church's views on the LGBTQ+ community. Sara cares about politics, whereas Ben is apathetic.When they return home, Sara stumbles upon a TikTok where a woman complains about Netflix casting \"shitty\" men on the Minnesota season of \"Love Is Blind.\" Ben believes the video is about him because he dated the woman but tells Sarah he doesn't remember what he did to her to make her make a video about him.After some tough conversations, during which Ben says he supports the LGBTQ+ community and offers to educate himself about politics, Sara decides to look past these differences and continue the process with him.Still, at the altar, Sara says she can't marry him, citing that they're not on the same wavelength. He prompts her to continue dating, but she demurs, saying they'll discuss it later.Ben and Sara still follow each other on social media, so it wouldn't be completely impossible to learn that they've reunited at the reunion on Sunday. At the very least, it seems to indicate they're cordial.Devin and VirginiaVirginia and Devin do not get married on \"Love Is Blind.\"Courtesy of NetflixDevin finds two candidates for a future partner on the show: Brittany and Virginia. He ultimately concludes he and Brittany are better as friends and picks Virginia.Devin and Virginia's main disagreement arises when Virginia asks Devin to sign a prenup. Devin is initially nervous about the contract, but he agrees to sign it after speaking to his family and lawyer.They reach the altar, where Devin says, \"I do.\" Despite both of their families feeling confident about the match, Virginia says no in an emotional moment. She explains that she hasn't had enough time to get deep with Devin, citing his hesitance to talk about his political views and the fact that their sexual relationship isn't quite there yet.Virginia is following Devin on Instagram, but Devin is not following Virginia. So it's still TBD whether they hashed it out and decided to keep dating after the show.Taylor and DanielDaniel and Taylor are the only couple to get married in this season.Courtesy of NetflixTaylor and Daniel build a strong connection in the pods, bonding over their shared family values and love for Christmas. After they engage and meet in person for the first time, Taylor believes Daniel had followed her on Instagram before the filming began and used information from her account to get her to fall in love with him.Taylor confronts Daniel about this and then is given her phone to confirm her suspicions. She finds no evidence of this, and Daniel is gracious to Taylor despite the accusation. They continue the process, and everything goes remarkably smoothly — Daniel's mom even accompanies Taylor to her wedding dress-shopping appointment.Unsurprisingly, they both say yes at the altar, becoming the only season eight couple to actually marry.We will have to wait until the reunion to see if they are still married today, but they are still following each other on social media, which could be a good sign.Monica and JoeyJoey and Monica were the first couple to get engaged in this season.Courtesy of NetflixMonica and Joey had one of the smoothest love journeys early in the season. They were the first pair to get engaged after bonding over their joint love for \"The Sound of Music\" and their close connection with their families.The first problem arises when Monica's sister doesn't approve of them getting married so soon and questions whether Joey is genuine.During their final pre-wedding date, Monica also brings up Joey's lack of physical affection. She worries that he doesn't feel as strongly about her as some of the other men do about their partners and expresses that she's unsure how he really feels about her.Monica and Joey still continue the journey to the altar, but Monica ultimately opts not to marry Joey, unable to get past her sense that he isn't all in with her. Joey doesn't seem bothered by Monica's decision, agreeing it was too soon. They hug and part cordially after their failed wedding, though Monica cries and tells the cameras that she's sad it turned out this way.They are still following each other, which means they are likely on civil terms now.Madison and AlexAlex dumped Madison in episode six.Courtesy of NetflixNo other couple is shown to get engaged in season eight, but the series covers a convoluted love square between Madison, Alex, Mason, and Meg.In the pods stage, Madison builds connections with both Alex and Mason. Mason also bonds with Meg.Madison and Alex choose each other, but Mason says he is committed to Madison before she can break things off. Madison tells Meg this information and then dumps Mason.Mason tells Alex what happened, and Alex gets into an argument with Madison over how she treated him. This leads to Alex also breaking up with Madison.During the cast party in episode 11, Madison tells Lauren that Alex tried to date her after the pods, suggesting it was because he saw her and realized she was attractive. Madison says that she thinks Alex is a liar now.She says Alex told her off-camera that he did not actually like Mason despite defending him on the show and told her that Meg was messaging him to get to know him.Alex and Meg did not get to share their sides of the story during the pod meetup, which may mean there will be a showdown during the reunion.Alex follows Madison on Instagram, but Madison does not follow Alex.Mason and MegMeg initially dumps Mason in the pods, but they date again later in the show.Courtesy of NetflixMason and Meg initially bond over their love for conspiracy theories before forming a deeper connection. However, Meg doesn't like that she is Mason's second choice in the pods, so she decides to break up with him.In episode 11, they arrive at the cast party together, revealing that they are dating now after messaging each other after receiving their phones back.Fans will have to wait until the reunion to see if they are still dating, but the couple do not follow each other on Instagram. That could either be a sign they've since split or just a red herring.Netflix's \"Love Is Blind\" reunion airs on Sunday.Read the original article on Business Insider Sara and Ben on \"Love Is Blind\" season 8.NetflixAll episodes of \"Love Is Blind\" season eight are available on Netflix.The season focuses on five couples who get engaged and two more couples who do not make it to engagement.Here's what happened to each of them.Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight finale.\"Love Is Blind\" season eight yielded four weddings but only one actual marriage.On Friday, Netflix released the wedding episode for the newest season of \"Love Is Blind,\" the streamer's most popular unscripted show. While the show, which premiered in 2020, has been a major success for Netflix, it's been less successful in helping people find their perfect matches — only 10 \"Love Is Blind\" couples are still together from the show's first seven seasons.A reunion episode, where the cast returns to give updates on their relationship status, premieres on Sunday, which could add more twists to the season.But for now, here's what we know about each of the main couples of this season as of the finale.Dave and LaurenDave and Lauren did not make it to the altar.Courtesy of NetflixIn the pod stage, Dave connected with multiple women but proposed to Lauren.However, when they get home and get their phones back, Dave hears from his friends and sister that Lauren has a secret boyfriend. When confronted, Lauren claims she and the unnamed man were hooking up but were never in a real relationship.Dave struggles to believe Lauren, refuses to let her meet his friends and family, and eventually breaks up with her in episode 11. Later in the episode, they both attend a cast party, and he apologizes to Lauren for letting his \"ego\" ruin their relationship and hints he might want to rekindle things. Lauren makes clear she has no interest in reuniting.As far as w",

        "description": "According to a new study by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, autoplay features on streaming sites like Netflix are shaping our decisions and extending our screen time. The study talks about turning off autoplay features and the change it could bring in user behavior. Autoplay feature on sites like Netflix stops users from deviating from streaming and this makes them watch things even if they came to the platform to watch only one episode or so.The study brought on board 76 participants who were moderate to heavy Netflix users. They were divided into two groups, with half of the group with autoplay features turned off and half of the group with autoplay features turned on. The researchers analyzed the viewing patterns of participants over six months, and it was found that the group that had the autoplay feature turned off spent less time watching Netflix. They also took more time to look at their viewing decisions and think about whether they want to watch more content or not. About 18 minutes of watching time were decreased when the participants had the auto-play feature turned off. One of the participants said that watching Netflix without auto-play made him realize how many episodes he has watched, but if the auto-play feature was turned on, he might not have paid attention. When the auto-play feature is on, it reduces friction and keeps users immersed in whatever they are watching so they do not get any time to make a conscious decision.A previous research also called the auto-preview feature a “dark pattern” which manipulates users and makes them prioritize the platform over anything. Half of the participants of the study said that they would turn on the auto-play feature again because it is convenient and makes it easier for them to go to the next content. But one-third of the participants also said that they would keep their auto-play feature turned off so they can reflect on how much content they have watched. It is important for streaming platforms to rethink their auto-play feature integration and turn off auto-play in default settings because it is harmful for many people, especially children.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: • Even with Reduced Expectations for Ratings, Consumers Actively Contribute Reviews on Google and Social Media• Social Media Trends Across Countries: Who Posts, Who Engages, and What Drives Users?",

The name comes from her title as Duchess of Sussex, which she gained when she married Prince Harry, 40.Meghan told Kaling she found it \"meaningful\" to share the same name as her children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3, calling Sussex their \"family name.\" And on Wednesday, Drew Barrymore introduced her as Meghan Sussex in a clip of her appearance on \"The Drew Barrymore Show,\" which airs Thursday.However, Archie and Lili weren't born with that last name, so Harry and Meghan's decision to use it may confuse people who don't religiously follow the royal family.Here's a breakdown of how surnames work for the royals and how Harry and Meghan may have made the change to Sussex.Royal last namesHarry's legal name when he was born was Henry Charles Albert David, and he didn't have a last name on his birth certificate. His official title was His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, as his father was the Prince of Wales.Often, royals simply do not use surnames, though some members of the British royal family use Mountbatten-Windsor as a last name when needed.The royal family has used the last name Windsor since 1917. In 1960, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip decided that their direct descendants who did not have HRH titles or have the title of prince or princess would use Mountbatten-Windsor, incorporating Philip's last name, according to the royal family's website.Prince Harry.Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty ImagesHarry never used Mountbatten-Windsor because he always had an HRH title. Instead, he went by Harry Wales when he needed a last name, such as when he was in school and the army, as did Prince William.Ahead of their May 2018 wedding, Buckingham Palace announced Harry and Meghan's new royal titles would be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Meghan gained an HRH title as Harry's wife.In contrast to their father, Archie and Lilibet's birth certificates listed Mountbatten-Windsor as their last names, as they did not have the titles of prince and princess at the time of their births. Instead, they were \"Master Archie\" and \"Miss Lilibet.\"The switch to SussexThough he agreed not to use it for official business in 2020, Harry did not formally give up his HRH title when he stepped back as a senior royal, so he never adopted Mountbatten-Windsor.However, Harry's children got new names and titles when the royal line of succession shifted after Queen Elizabeth II died and King Charles III took the throne in September 2022.King Charles ascended the throne in 2022.WPA Pool / Getty ImagesArchie and Lili moved to sixth and seventh in line for the throne and became Prince Archie of Sussex and Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Buckingham Palace updated the line of succession on its website to reflect their title changes in March 2023.Because they now had prince and princess titles, it would go against royal tradition for Archie and Lili to have continued using Mountbatten-Windsor despite it being on their birth certificates. So, the change to Sussex isn't new; it aligns with long-standing royal traditions.In March 2024, People reported that Harry and Meghan were using Sussex as their children's last name at school, adding that \"Sussex is their family surname.\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in February 2025.Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty ImagesIt's unclear if Harry and Meghan have legally changed their last name to Sussex.

In the show's eight episodes, the Duchess of Sussex shares entertaining tips and recipes with her famous friends, and she works on her craft with cooking experts like Roy Choi. However, one person is conspicuously absent from most of the series: Meghan's husband, Prince Harry.The Duke of Sussex only appears briefly in the show's final episode, a change for the couple who have been attached at the hip, particularly in their work, for nearly a decade.Although it's a shift for the duke and duchess, the professional separation makes perfect sense for Meghan as she returns to her lifestyle roots.The reality TV playbookHarry and Meghan began working together when they announced their engagement in 2017, which is standard for senior royals. They continued to brand themselves as a package deal in their early post-royal projects, like their first Netflix show, \"Harry & Meghan.\"\"I think they were very smart in the early days of trying to give the public what they wanted,\" Kristen Meinzer, a royal commentator, told Business Insider. \"The public wanted to know the story of what happened behind the castle doors.\"In recent months, that strategy has shifted. Harry has focused on philanthropic endeavors, attending events without his wife, while Meghan prioritizes her series and forthcoming lifestyle brand, As Ever.Stacy Jones, the founder and CEO of Hollywood Branded, told BI that Meghan's decision to make \"With Love, Meghan\" largely Harry-less was savvy, even if his royal lineage is part of why people are tuning into the show.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attend the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in April 2024.Yaroslav Sabitov/PA Images via Getty ImagesJones compared \"With Love, Meghan\" to other reality series that star women married to famous men, like \"The Osbournes\" or some of the \"Real Housewives\" franchises. \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" also relied heavily on Robert Kardashian's memories in its early seasons.Jones said that the successful man functions as a \"prop\" while his wife is the star beloved by audiences, and he typically only makes brief on-screen appearances — just as Harry does on \"With Love, Meghan.\"Sure, having your literal prince of a husband make one long-awaited guest appearance on the series probably helps keep viewers tuned in, but keeping Harry off-screen until that moment allows Meghan to sell herself as an individual rather than just one half of the Sussex team.\"It's important to have that prop because that's the unique definer,\" Jones said about Harry's royal status. \"Meghan with Harry is special, but Meghan does not have to be with Harry at her side all the time.\"Off-screen supportAlthough he isn't on screen much, traces of Harry are all over the show, as Meghan discusses her family's favorite foods or their routine with their children and dogs.She also told People that she and Harry are in \"a honeymoon period again\" because of her work on the show, adding that he and her children frequently visited her on set.\"My husband met me when I had The Tig, and I see this spark in his eye when he sees me doing the thing that I was doing when he first met me,\" she told People, speaking of the blog she ran from 2014 to 2017. \"I think he loves watching as much as I love doing that creative process.\"Jones said those traces of Harry in the series can remind the audience they are a unit even as they define themselves as individuals, and Meghan can do the same for Harry as he finds his post-royal identity.Meghan's appearance at the Invictus Games in February was a step in the right direction. She seemed like Harry's supporter rather than the cohost of the games, even leaving them a few days early to return to their children.Harry and Meghan's professional lives will likely always be intertwined in some capacity, but their newfound distance will benefit them both.

Harry has focused on philanthropic endeavors, attending events without his wife, while Meghan prioritizes her series and forthcoming lifestyle brand, As Ever.Stacy Jones, the founder and CEO of Hollywood Branded, told BI that Meghan's decision to make \"With Love, Meghan\" largely Harry-less was savvy, even if his royal lineage is part of why people are tuning into the show.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attend the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in April 2024.Yaroslav Sabitov/PA Images via Getty ImagesJones compared \"With Love, Meghan\" to other reality series that star women married to famous men, like \"The Osbournes\" or some of the \"Real Housewives\" franchises. \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" also relied heavily on Robert Kardashian's memories in its early seasons.Jones said that the successful man functions as a \"prop\" while his wife is the star beloved by audiences, and he typically only makes brief on-screen appearances — just as Harry does on \"With Love, Meghan.\"Sure, having your literal prince of a husband make one long-awaited guest appearance on the series probably helps keep viewers tuned in, but keeping Harry off-screen until that moment allows Meghan to sell herself as an individual rather than just one half of the Sussex team.\"It's important to have that prop because that's the unique definer,\" Jones said about Harry's royal status. \"Meghan with Harry is special, but Meghan does not have to be with Harry at her side all the time.\"Off-screen supportAlthough he isn't on screen much, traces of Harry are all over the show, as Meghan discusses her family's favorite foods or their routine with their children and dogs.She also told People that she and Harry are in \"a honeymoon period again\" because of her work on the show, adding that he and her children frequently visited her on set.\"My husband met me when I had The Tig, and I see this spark in his eye when he sees me doing the thing that I was doing when he first met me,\" she told People, speaking of the blog she ran from 2014 to 2017. \"I think he loves watching as much as I love doing that creative process.\"Jones said those traces of Harry in the series can remind the audience they are a unit even as they define themselves as individuals, and Meghan can do the same for Harry as he finds his post-royal identity.Meghan's appearance at the Invictus Games in February was a step in the right direction. She seemed like Harry's supporter rather than the cohost of the games, even leaving them a few days early to return to their children.Harry and Meghan's professional lives will likely always be intertwined in some capacity, but their newfound distance will benefit them both.

        "description": "Meghan Markle on Netflix's \"With Love, Meghan.\"NetflixMeghan Markle's Netflix show dropped on Tuesday, and she is launching a lifestyle brand this spring.It might be difficult for Meghan to stand out and seem relatable in the lifestyle industry.PR and branding experts said leveraging her royal status may help Meghan find success.Say hello to the new Meghan Markle — again.On Tuesday, \"With Love, Meghan\" dropped on Netflix. In the first episode alone, the Duchess of Sussex explained how to make a bath salt kit, shared a hack for making homemade popcorn in a paper bag, harvested honey from her personal hive, and made candles with the leftover wax.The lifestyle series presents Meghan as a jack of all trades when it comes to hosting and homemaking, complementing her lifestyle brand, As Ever. The brand's first product line will be available later this spring. On Tuesday, Meghan revealed As Ever's offerings will include spreads, teas, crepe and cookie mixes, and flower petal sprinkles, which she often uses on \"With Love, Meghan.\"These new ventures won't surprise longtime fans who have followed Meghan since her scrappy blogging days, but it's also no secret that critics are primed to critique these latest moves. Add in the pressure of entering the oversaturated aspirational lifestyle market, and it's clear Meghan has an uphill battle in creating a brand that feels inviting and approachable. After all, few things are less relatable than a duchess telling you your life can be like hers.Still, if Meghan can stay true to her fans and lean into her life's fairy-tale arc, she might be on her way to starting her best chapter, experts say.The crowded lifestyle industryAlthough she was known for her acting career before she married Prince Harry, Meghan also ran a blog called The Tig from 2014 to 2017, sharing recipes, travel stories, and posts about her favorite restaurants.Her two new ventures — \"With Love, Meghan\" and As Ever — allow her to tap back into those interests before her royal detour, though it will have to evolve as she did in the last eight years.\"She was creating some branding, but it was not as cultured. It was not as refined,\" Stacy Jones, the founder and CEO of Hollywood Branded, told Business Insider of The Tig. \"Becoming part of the royal family, she opened up a whole different level of product class.\"Meghan Markle's brand, As Ever, will launch in the spring.Mark Cuthbert/Getty ImagesAlthough Meghan's passion for lifestyle is well-established, the industry is crowded. Martha Stewart has long been the it-girl of the lifestyle world, and celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba have carved their own place in the industry with Goop and the Honest Company, finding commercial and financial success. Goop was worth $433 million in 2020, and as of March 2025, the Honest Company, which went public in 2021, was valued at about $530 million.Likewise, influencers such as Meredith Hayden have built massive social media followings with lifestyle content, appealing to viewers as \"every women.\"Jones said Meghan will \"need a strong and unique selling point\" to make As Ever resonate. Megan Balyk, the vice president of Jive PR + Digital, told BI she thinks Meghan will struggle if she \"cannot find a clear, consistent brand identity.\"Consistency has been an issue for Meghan since 2020, said Balyk. Meghan has tried her hand at ventures that didn't pan out, like her animated series \"Pearl\" or the $20 million Spotify deal to make podcasts with Harry. (People reported on March 3 that Meghan is working on a new podcast with Lemonada Media.)The ever-evolving nature of Meghan's post-royal life has also bred some public distrust, and she doesn't do herself any favors by seeming to take cues from the royals' \"never complain, never explain\" mantra when it comes to her middling business dealings.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in April 2024.Yaroslav Sabitov/PA Images via Getty ImagesFor instance, Meghan announced in February that she was changing her company's name from American Riviera Orchard, a nickname for her neighborhood of Santa Barbara, to As Ever. She cited her partnership with Netflix, her desire to make items that aren't just localized, and the name's nod to her longtime love of cooking as the reasons for the change.There's truth there, but it doesn't tell the whole story. The trademark office temporarily denied Meghan's application for American Riviera Orchard in August 2024, saying the name was \"primarily geographically descriptive.\"That denial was likely a motivating factor in the rebrand, and when that kind of information trickles out to the public from the media or internet sleuths as Meghan tells an edited version of events, her critics — who have no reason to give her the benefit of the doubt — may feel even more vindicated in distrusting her.Finding her brandMeghan's ventures have an effortlessly luxurious feel in their branding so far, simultaneously appealing and just slightly out of reach. Their light tones are also starkly different from those of her previous Netflix hit, \"Harry & Meghan,\" which detailed her struggles with royal life. Harry is also largely absent from her new show.The people watching \"With Love, Meghan\" will likely differ from those eager to hear about her dramatic life as a royal.\"People like looking at train wrecks and car crashes, and they want to gossip,\" Jones said. \"You're really leaning into a very different type of fan base.\"Meghan has to build out a new audience that trusts her, but her existing supporters can help. Young women make up much of her fan base, and Black women have been some of Meghan's strongest supporters as she's risen to fame.Meghan Markle in May 2024.KOLA SULAIMON/AFP via Getty ImagesJones said it could \"be a huge missed opportunity\" if Meghan doesn't prioritize Black women in her lifestyle ventures.\"Most celebrity lifestyle brands cater to a polished, elite, mostly white audience,\" she said. \"If Meghan embraces this community with real action, As Ever could be powerful. If she doesn't, it may feel like she's lost touch with the very people who saw themselves in her story.\"Balyk also said that it might be easier for Meghan to build a brand people trust if she positions Melinda Gates and Oprah Winfrey as her contemporaries rather than Stewart or Paltrow, as her passion for philanthropy has been clear to the public from the earliest days of her fame.If she can incorporate that focus on giving back into her lifestyle work, Meghan may even be able to get the best of both worlds.Authentically MeghanWhen Meghan made The Tig, she was in the sweet spot of being successful but not too famous.Now, though, she is among the most famous people in the world, married to a prince, and mother to children who are sixth and seventh in line for the British throne. She also lives in a celebrity-studded neighborhood in California and counts A-list stars among her close friends.Lifestyle content thrives when consumers relate to the creator, but Meghan's life is so singular that relatability isn't an option for her anymore, no matter how much she wants it to be.Ironically, Jones told BI that Meghan may be able to make herself more approachable to audiences by reminding them that she isn't like them.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at their 2018 wedding.Ben STANSALL - WPA Pool/Getty Images\"Everyone can buy in on the princess,\" she said. \"Americans like a fable. They like a happy ending.\"Viewers might not be able to see themselves in much of Meghan's life, but they can invest in the American dream she lived, looking to her for guidance on how to make their ordinary lives just a bit more sparkly. The duchess can also use her show to tell that story and sell customers on As Ever.\"She has a literal infomercial for who she is that can be viewed 24/7 and streamed,\" Jones said. \"She can tell the stories about the lifestyle and the brand. She can paint pictures about her jam and how it came to be and all the little steps that actually people are fascinated with.\"Meghan's fairy tale shouldn't be hard to sell. She is a beautiful actor who fell in love with a prince and wants to live happily ever by helping people make their lives more aesthetically pleasing. If she can tap into that narrative, Meghan will finally find a niche that feels like home.Read the original article on Business Insider Meghan Markle on Netflix's \"With Love, Meghan.\"NetflixMeghan Markle's Netflix show dropped on Tuesday, and she is launching a lifestyle brand this spring.It might be difficult for Meghan to stand out and seem relatable in the lifestyle industry.PR and branding experts said leveraging her royal status may help Meghan find success.Say hello to the new Meghan Markle — again.On Tuesday, \"With Love, Meghan\" dropped on Netflix.

        "description": "Amazon is adding NBA games to its sports lineup this year.Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesAmazon's video ads chief laid out his plan to grow TV ad share, including a new ad buying and planning tool.He said Amazon is prioritizing ad performance over \"public bragging rights.\"Amazon faces stronger competition for streaming ads as rivals grow live sports and TV viewership.Amazon led the way in bringing live sports to streaming and disrupted the market last year when it rolled out ads by default to its Prime Video viewership. But it's facing stronger competition in 2025 from Netflix, Google-owned YouTube, and more.One advantage Amazon still has is its massive scale and trove of data.Krishan Bhatia, the NBCUniversal vet who was tapped to lead ad sales for Prime Video last year, said reach was \"fundamental\" — especially when using \"data and targeting to optimize against audience segments.\"Amazon touts a reach of 115 million monthly ad-supported viewers on Prime Video, which grows to 175 million when the rest of its TV offering is included.Another core part of Bhatia's pitch is making it easier to buy advertising across that audience. To help grow its share of advertisers' budgets, Amazon is rolling out a new tool called Complete TV. This tool lets advertisers view data from their streaming TV ad buys across Amazon and its competitors in one place. Complete TV can then give them AI-generated recommendations for how to spend more of their budgets (with Amazon, presumably).Bhatia spoke ahead of planned pitches scheduled with ad holding companies the week of March 3.Amazon's pitch may not satisfy some TV advertisers, who have told BI they don't want to be limited to using Amazon's ad-buying tech, which they say prevents them from holistically measuring their spending across media companies. They asked for anonymity when discussing business deals; their identities are known to BI.Advertisers still question who's watchingBhatia talked up Amazon's live sports prowess, bolstered by the addition of the NBA this year, plus its customer data and ability to tie ads to outcomes.But beyond sports, Prime Video has more to prove to advertisers who want to be associated with shows people are passionate about. Amazon's share of TV viewing, at 3.7% in January, trails YouTube, Netflix, and Disney. It has broadly popular shows but hasn't had a mega hit with the cultural impact of Netflix's \"Squid Game\" or \"Stranger Things.\"Bhatia pointed to the action TV series \"Reacher\" and sci-fi drama \"Fallout\" as examples of Amazon's popular entertainment.\"I think everyone wants to have hits,\" he said. \"There's no question about that. I think we've had our share of hits and our studio teams and content programming teams continue to be focused on finding great IP that scales in the US and scales globally as well.\"Bhatia said Amazon is working to develop more audience insights for advertisers but that it wouldn't match Netflix in publicizing comprehensive viewership stats for shows and movies.\"When we serve the customer, we talk about the data that matters,\" he said. \"And they understand the performance, they understand the reach, they understand the audience insights that we're delivering to them. That's more important than the public bragging rights that may come along with them.\"However, some advertisers tell BI they still want more data from streamers generally — particularly around which shows their ads appear on — similar to what they get on linear TV.Amazon also touts as a selling point that it relies less on interruptive formats by using shopping carousels and AI tools to soup up its ad targeting abilities.\"We've been committed from the outset to keep the interruptive ad load to a minimum,\" Bhatia said. \"That means that you're going to have a lower interruptive ad load on average. It's a balancing act, but our strategy is to have a diverse set of ad experiences that do not just rely on growing 15 and 30-second commercials.\"Krishan Bhatia leads Amazon's ad efforts on Prime Video.Rick Kern/Getty Images for AmazonAmazon faces tougher competition in 2025Amazon pulled in $3.8 billion in streaming video revenue last year, to Netflix's $1.5 billion, EMARKETER estimated.But it faces increased competition.Netflix is making ads a bigger part of its growth plan and has shown it can convene large live audiences with two Christmas Day NFL games and the Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson boxing match late last year. YouTube has user data that rivals Amazon and has been the top TV viewing destination for two years running. Disney now has more TV viewing share than Amazon across Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu combined.Ad insiders say thanks in part to Amazon flooding the market and driving down rivals' prices, buyers have more places to go and expect still more bargains — which they expect to use to extract further price cuts.Read the original article on Business Insider Amazon is adding NBA games to its sports lineup this year.Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesAmazon's video ads chief laid out his plan to grow TV ad share, including a new ad buying and planning tool.He said Amazon is prioritizing ad performance over \"public bragging rights.\"Amazon faces stronger competition for streaming ads as rivals grow live sports and TV viewership.Amazon led the way in bringing live sports to streaming and disrupted the market last year when it rolled out ads by default to its Prime Video viewership.
