Date: 2025-06-15 11:40:01

Date: 2025-06-02 13:42:07
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the Tudum event showcases upcoming content and generates hype, its immediate impact on NFLX's stock price within 60 minutes is likely minimal.

Date: 2025-05-14 22:48:54
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news describes the introduction of AI-enhanced ads in 2026. While potentially impacting long-term ad revenue, the distant timeframe (2026) significantly reduces any immediate (60-minute) price impact. The absence of quantifiable data, direct financial impact in the short term, and surprise factor (as it's an incremental advertising strategy adjustment) further supports a NEUTRAL classification.

Title: Netflix co-CEO says production in India has had $2B impact: reports
Date: 2025-05-03 18:29:11
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While $2B is a significant figure, the title only suggests *impact* and lacks detail on whether it is positive or negative for NFLX's revenue/profit. Without knowing if the impact means revenue generated or investment spent, the short-term directional impact is unclear; thus, it's unlikely to cause a significant price move in the next 60 minutes based solely on this title.

Date: 2025-05-03 13:36:04
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The headline "Netflix Co-CEO Says India Investment Has Had $2 Billion Impact" presents a positive economic impact figure. While the details are already public knowledge to some extent, the quantified $2 billion impact will likely create positive sentiment and a small buying pressure in the very short term (next 60 minutes) due to perceived successful expansion.

Date: 2025-05-02 23:13:07
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While new content is generally important for Netflix, a simple announcement of upcoming shows, even with well-known creators, is unlikely to trigger a significant price movement within 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-05-02 23:00:23
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The announcement of new movies on Netflix, while relevant to its service, is a routine occurrence and largely anticipated.

Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: A change in Netflix's Top 10 list is common and unlikely to significantly impact revenue or perceived value within the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-05-02 17:55:04
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The news highlights an unprecedented win streak for NFLX, suggesting strong positive momentum. While some profit-taking is possible, the "all-time high levels" and "longest positive run ever" narrative likely triggers immediate FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, pushing the price higher in the short term. The surprise and magnitude of the streak will likely outweigh concerns about overvaluation within the 60-minute window.
```

Title: One Of The Best Zombie Movies Ever Made Lands On Netflix Today
Date: 2025-05-02 13:00:00

Explanation: While adding content is generally a positive for Netflix, a single zombie movie, even a highly rated one, is unlikely to have a significant impact on NFLX's stock price within 60 minutes. The magnitude of this event is too small to generate a meaningful, immediate surge in buying pressure or subscriber sign-ups that would be reflected in the stock price.

Date: 2025-05-01 11:03:06
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: A review of a new show, even if positive, lacks the immediate quantifiable data to drive significant price movement within 60 minutes.

Earnings show why that’s a reasonable goal" and the description mentioning analyst growth expectations even in a recession suggest a strong positive outlook.

Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The headline "Netflix Strong Results" suggests positive news directly impacting NFLX's revenue and profitability.

Date: 2025-04-18 03:51:52
Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The title specifically mentions "Netflix Earnings Beat". Earnings beats are a known positive catalyst.

Date: 2025-04-18 00:07:12
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news of Netflix exploring video podcasts is not a significant surprise, as they are constantly looking for new content formats.

Date: 2025-04-17 23:45:49
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The news suggests Netflix is being cautious, and maintaining guidance instead of raising it, despite a favorable outlook. This creates a negative surprise factor because the market anticipates growth, making it likely to trigger selling in the short term (sentiment trigger). No specific quantifiable data points are present, but the lack of positive guidance is concerning and will likely cause traders to react negatively within 60 minutes.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Mark Douglas on Netflix Earnings & Ad Business
Date: 2025-04-17 23:33:18
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news describes an interview about Netflix's earnings and ad business.

Date: 2025-04-17 22:35:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: This news reflects a change in Reed Hastings' role from executive chairman to chairman and non-executive director. While significant for the company's leadership structure, it's unlikely to trigger immediate, substantial price movement in the next 60 minutes as he remains involved.

Sentiment: positive
Explanation: The Q1 revenue beat (10.54B vs 10.51B est.) is a positive surprise, suggesting continued growth and exceeding expectations.

Date: 2025-03-18 22:16:14
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: While the $11 million fraud is a negative headline, the news explicitly states that an arbitrator ruled in Netflix's favor *last year*.
