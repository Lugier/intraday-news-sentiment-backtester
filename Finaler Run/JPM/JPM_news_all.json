He said the business community needs cyber, coding, programming, financial management, and project management skills, among other things, and that investing in schools can help close the gap.\"It's getting out and going directly into the schools,\" Dimon said to the room of business leaders. \"I would guess most of us go to a lot more schools now.\" There are some \"wonderful examples\" of in-school programs that help kids get jobs after graduation, he added.Dimon, who is on the board of the New York Jobs CEO Council, which aims to shrink income and opportunity gaps, said curricula should change. High schools and colleges should continue teaching the typical topics — and, he said, \"be proud of\" American history courses — as well as more specialized, workplace-focused skills.Dimon's vision, as he laid it out on Tuesday, is that schools should offer classes that award credentials as part of a typical curriculum, not extra credit. He said that some schools are more open to working with the private sector than others.JPMorgan has various school and apprenticeship programs for skills like business management and technology, according to its website. Representatives for JPMorgan did not respond to BI's request for comment.Dimon has talked about education in the past, saying that there should be more workplace training and classes on financial education.\"They all want jobs,\" the billionaire said on Tuesday. \"Graduating, a lot of these kids end up doing — and it's not bad — but they end up doing retail or inventory or something like that, but there are jobs in coding, cyber, financial management.\"Dimon said businesses have a key role to play in solving these longstanding problems and can't rely on the government alone.

        "description": "The chase is on among premium credit card issuers. JPMorgan Chase has announced some big changes to its high-end Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card, which include a hefty new annual fee of $795, up from $550. The Sapphire Reserve card, which is known for its slate of perks and benefits including travel credits and access to airport lounges, is also getting a counterpart in the Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business card. When the card was first introduced in 2016, the annual fee was $450, so it has increased by more than 75% since then. Interestingly, customers don’t seem to mind: The amount paid in annual fees totaled $6.4 billion in 2022, more than double the $3 billion paid in 2015, according to a 2023 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). When will the fee increase take effect? According to Chase, customers still have a few days to sign up for the card at the old rate. If you’re already a Sapphire Preferred member, or if you sign up before Monday, June 23, you can expect the same benefits and fee through October 25 of this year. Though the fee is increasing significantly, there will be new card designs, and new credits and benefits that arrive along with the revamp. Specifically, for cardholders who spend at least $75,000 per year on their cards, there will be new perks, such as exclusive online shopping experiences, and status rewards at IHG Hotels, and Southwest Airlines. Points earnings rates and multipliers are also changing through a new Points Boost program. The new Business card will also have credits for services from ZipRecruiter, Google Workspace, and more. “It’s the culmination of five years of investment that we’ve made across Chase in completely uplifting and repositioning what we mean for premium travelers in the premium-card space,” Allison Beer, JPMorgan’s head of card and connected commerce, told Bloomberg. “This is about having the best-in-class travel assets and an end-to-end travel experience.” Premium card issuers up the stakes Chase’s announcement comes shortly after American Express, one of its chief rivals in the credit card space, teased a forthcoming overhaul to its premium Platinum Card. Details are scarce, but those changes are expected by the end of the year. The Platinum Card currently has a $695 annual fee. In all, the board is set for Chase and Amex to duke it out with their premium offerings, which might provide some serious perks to customers who can afford them. “We’re going to take these cards to a new level,” Amex’s said Howard Grosfield in a statement, “not only in what they offer in travel, dining and lifestyle benefits, but also in how they look and feel, to meet the evolving needs of our customers.”",

Days later, buyout shops Apollo Global Management and General Atlantic heeded the warning and announced they'd stop the recruiting tactic.Even Apollo's CEO, Marc Rowan, seemed to credit Dimon for his firm's decision.\"When someone says something that is just plainly true, I feel compelled to agree with it,\" Rowan, the Apollo CEO, told Business Insider last week, following his firm's decision to back out of recruiting 2027 associates this year.Dimon, who has proven influence over a wide range of topics including the economy and the workplace, has been no stranger to critiquing private equity's recruiting practices. He blasted them last year, telling students at Georgetown University that he believes they're \"unethical\" and that he wants to ban them.\"I think it's wrong to put you in the position,\" Dimon said, adding: \"You have to kind of decide the next career move before you have a chance to even decide what the company is like.\"The question is, why now? Nothing changed last year — so what triggered Apollo and General Atlantic to suddenly reverse course?Neither firm responded to interview requests from BI to speak with executives in time for the publication of this story. Industry insiders, however, pointed to a series of factors that they said have made it easier for firms to heed Dimon's words of warning, including the persistent slowdown in deal activity and the rise of artificial intelligence, which could supplant the need for some early career jobs.Frustrations have also been mounting over a recruiting process that has shifted earlier and earlier in recent years.\"The matching process is yielding a lower success rate and many candidates will sign without fully knowing what they're getting into,\" Matt Ting, the founder of Peak Frameworks, a popular Wall Street careers course provider, told BI in April.Should any one of these factors change (deal activity picking up, for example), the rat race could come roaring back, some people said.\"Being cynical, it's an easy time for them to make such a decision,\" said a senior banker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his job and relationships with financial sponsors.Mounting frustrationsThe golden age of private equity has been over for some time now, thanks to higher borrowing costs and a persistently sluggish deals market.While it's unclear how this might be impacting hiring at the junior levels, the investment banker said his firm has seen a slowdown in the number of bankers poached.\"The reality is, if things were extremely frothy right now, and they had a ton of deals going on and they needed more people, they'd actually be recruiting people off-cycle out of banks right now to fill seats immediately,\" the banker said, adding: \"And they're not, you know what I'm saying?\"Young bankers who spoke to BI, meanwhile, raised concerns that artificial intelligence could reduce the need for new blood in the coming years. Earlier this year at an industry conference, the CEO of buyout firm Vista Equity Partners predicted some 60% of the conference's attendees would be \"looking for work\" by next year due to artificial intelligence.What's more, BI has for years been hearing of growing tensions over the industry's pressure-cooker hiring tactics, which have been known to include middle-of-the-night interviews and demands that candidates make a decision before they leave the room or see their offers evaporate. The intensity has soured some young bankers on joining the industry, as BI has previously reported. Early recruiting timelines have also led to more candidates walking away from job offers they had signed at the start of their career — leaving firms to scramble to fill an open role.\"One big issue with the early on-cycle is that reneging has gone up a lot,\" Ting told BI.What happens next is anyone's guess. For now, investment banks appear hopeful that other private equity firms follow Apollo and General Atlantic's lead.

Business Insider obtained and reviewed a copy of the memo, which was first reported by Bloomberg.\"As you transition to the workforce, we believe you should take time early in your career to deepen your understanding of the business world and reflect on what you are most passionate about so you can make the best-informed decisions as you contemplate your career,\" the letter said.The move flies in the face of industry norms to recruit first-year investment bankers for jobs that won't start for two years. This practice, known as \"on-cycle,\" demands junior bankers compete for future-dated private equity jobs within a day or two after being notified, which can result in missed vacations or middle-of-the-night interviews after work.In recent years, the timeline has inched earlier, kicking off before candidates even start their first postgrad jobs with investment banks.The news comes days after JPMorgan told its incoming first-year bankers that they'd fire anyone who accepted one of these pre-dated jobs. The bank also sought to crack down on analysts sneaking out of job training to interview with private equity firms.\"I think that's unethical. I don't like it, and I may eliminate it regardless of what the private-equity guys say,\" Dimon told college students at Georgetown University last year.One first-year banker planning to participate in on-cycle recruiting said he was stunned by Apollo's letter and that friends who had been planning to interview with the firm were feeling let down.\"It's quite surprising,\" he told BI. \"My friends who have been preparing are disappointed. Those who have not been are relieved.\"In a statement to BI, Apollo CEO Mark Rowan said the bank is making the change to improve the quality of its recruits while also acknowledging concerns raised by Wall Street leaders like Dimon.\"When someone says something that is just plainly true, I feel compelled to agree with it,\" he said in a statement to BI. \"Bank CEOs, along with others, have said what many of us have been thinking: recruiting has crept earlier and earlier every year and asking students to make career decisions before they truly understand their options doesn't serve them or our industry. We are in a fortunate position where we see an abundance of talent. But when great candidates make rushed decisions it creates avoidable turnover—and that serves no one.\"See the letter Apollo sent to would-be job candidates:Congratulations on your recent graduation and the start of your career in investment banking. We know how exciting — and demanding — this period can be, and we're confident it will be a valuable foundation for your professional journey.As you transition to the workforce, we believe you should take time early in your career to deepen your understanding of the business world and reflect on what you are most passionate about so you can make the best-informed decisions as you contemplate your career.

The head of America’s largest bank has a gloomy forecast for the U.S. economy. [contact-form-7] “I think there’s a real chance numbers will deteriorate soon,” J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in reference to indicators like the labor market Tuesday (June 10), noting major upheaval in things such as trade and global politics. “There’s a lot of moving parts,” said Dimon, whose comments at the Morgan Stanley US Financials Conference were reported by Seeking Alpha. “We see it a little bit today. The tariffs are hitting.” Dimon predicted large impacts happening in “maybe July, August, September, October….hopefully, it will not be dramatic. Maybe it’ll be a little softer of a soft landing.” “None of it is material yet,” he added. “If inflation rears its ugly head, or you see stagflation, that will shock people.” Dimon’s thoughts on the state of the economy were echoed by other banking CEOs who spoke at the Morgan Stanley event. For example, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said the lender expects U.S. consumer loan growth to remain flat or possibly decrease through the end of the year. “I wouldn’t expect large growth on the consumer side in any way, potentially even a net decline,” Santomassimo said. As for commercial loans, the executive said the uncertainty around tariffs makes it tough to predict the sector’s growth this year. Also at the conference was Citigroup Head of Banking Vis Raghavan, who said the bank is readying for a potential downturn in consumer financial health by putting aside more provisions for potential losses on loans. “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million,” Raghavan said, adding that the bank’s credit reserve build changes frequently according to its outlook. Their comments came the same day that the World Bank released the latest installment of its Global Economic Prospects report, in which it slashed its growth forecasts for 70% of the world’s economies, including the U.S., China and Europe, from levels it projected just before President Donald Trump took office. “Only six months ago, a ‘soft landing’ appeared to be in sight: the global economy was stabilizing after an extraordinary string of calamities both natural and man-made over the past few years,” wrote Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “That moment has passed. The world economy today is once more running into turbulence. Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep. International discord — about trade, in particular — has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II.” The post JPMorgan CEO: ‘Real Chance’ US Economic Numbers Will Dip appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

JPMorganChase has begun accepting applications for a FinTech accelerator program for U.K. startups. [contact-form-7] As American Banker reported Monday (June 9), the Fintech Forward Accelerator is a 12-week, in-person and virtual program for FinTech founders who want to employ technology to develop scalable financial services solutions. The program, developed by the banking giant and the consulting firm EY, will take applications until June 27, with plans to run from September to November of this year. “At J.P. Morgan Payments, our north star is to improve the payments ecosystem and transform the movement of information, money and assets,” said Veronique Steiner, head of EMEA innovation economy at J.P. Morgan Payments. “We’re actively encouraging applications from founders or business leaders who are overcoming obstacles to growing a business, including a lack of proximity to funding and networks, and are addressing the needs of underserved consumers, businesses or communities.” Successful applicants will get mentorship from bank executives, a two-day offsite session at JPMorganChase’s technology center in Glasgow and the chance to showcase their business to potential investors and commercial partners. According to the report, the accelerator is targeting U.K. FinTechs with a “live product demonstrating market traction” and yearly revenues that don’t exceed £1 million. The program comes at a time when U.K. startups are having trouble finding funding, leaving some of them to seek help from the U.S. According to an April Financial Times (FT) report, British startups took in just £16.2 billion ($21.1 billion) last year, the lowest figure since 2020. Meanwhile, American tech startups raised more than £65 billion in 2024, a 71% increase over the previous year. “Recognizing that most venture funding comes from the U.S., we set up as a Delaware corporation — the preferred and familiar structure for U.S. investors,” Mati Staniszewski, co-founder of artificial intelligence (AI) company ElevenLabs, told the FT. Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about renewed enthusiasm for FinTechs following Circle’s initial public offering (IPO). “There are other signs of investors putting their dollars to work (while reaping some rewards via equity stakes, of course) to help hasten the tech-driven transformation of money movement,” that report said. “Recent funding rounds have touched on everything from infrastructure to B2B to platform-based lending.” The post JPMorgan Opens FinTech Forward Accelerator Program to UK Startups appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Employees taking up the offer must also choose work from a location where they have the legal right to work, meaning this is not a \"work from anywhere\" program.The bank, which employs 230,000 people around the globe, rolled out its hybrid work model following the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, banks like JPMorgan Chase have reversed their hybrid work policies, demanding that employees from front- and back-office roles return to their desks five days a week.Citi has offered a similar two-week remote work option in December every year since 2022, but the last time it offered this perk during the summer was in August of 2022.Fraser and her executive team have long framed hybrid work as a competitive advantage for luring talent. The 57-year-old CEO has even shared her own story about flexibile work, saying it enabled her to remain in the workforce as a mom while also serving as a partner at the consulting firm McKinsey in the early 2000s.JPMorgan Chase has mandated five days in the office, a move that's helped fuel the rise of a nascent union drive. Goldman Sachs, one of the first Wall Street banks to insist its employees return to the office Monday through Friday, has also fortified its five-day office policy, with executives saying it's central to the company's culture of mentorship and togetherness.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser has advocated for continued remote work flexibility for years, while other Wall Street leaders support the opposite.John Lamparski/Getty ImagesSee the full memo sent by Citi CHRO Sara Wechter below.Message from Sara WechterColleagues,At Citi, we recognize that the nature of work is ever evolving, and we strive every day to shape a work environment where our colleagues can thrive. In particular, our hybrid work model helps us attract and retain top talent and sets us apart from other companies in our industry — and we remain committed to this model.Because we know how much you value the opportunity for flexibility, we are pleased to share that colleagues in hybrid roles will have the opportunity to work fully remotely for two weeks of your choosing in August.We've selected August because it is traditionally a quieter time for some of our businesses and clients, when many are already out of the office due to vacations.

Other problems he sees for the market include high valuations and economic uncertainty. Former JPMorgan chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic sees a stock market pullback in the cards, and the Trump-Musk feud could be one of the triggers that sets off a decline.

It's important for certain companies, and it can spill over,\" Kolanovic said of the president's fallout with Musk. \"Tesla is one of the biggest holdings of retail investors. There's a little ecosystem of stocks around it. I think it could be a little bit of a catalyst.\"In a post on X on Thursday, Kolanovic pointed to popular retail stocks such as Tesla, Palantir, and Super Micro as potential triggers of a momentum crash. Tesla stock plunged 14% on Thursday as Trump responded to Musk's criticisms of the big GOP tax and budget bill.Back in February (2/19) drop of $PLTR on dod spending cut started market wide momentum crash. Today, we have several crowded retail names $TSLA $PLTR $SMCI that could start a similar development ...— Marko Kolanovic (@markoinny) June 5, 2025However, Kolanovic also noted that the Trump-Musk fight would be one possible catalyst for a market pullback among many. Uncertainty in the economy and the trade war are also looming problems.\"We're close to all-time highs, but we still have all the problems,\" Kolanovic said. \"We have a trade war, we have signs of an economic slowdown.\"Valuations are stretched, he said, with the Nasdaq close to record highs even as rates remain elevated, and Kolanovic sees warning signs in the bond market. The risk-reward tradeoff for stocks versus bonds looks unattractive, as the 10-year Treasury yield hovers around 4.4%. That means equity investors aren't getting a great return in excess of the risk-free rate.There's also the lingering concern about Fed independence, with Trump repeatedly pressuring Powell to cut interest rates. Macro risks are mounting as well. Kolanovic pointed to the weak ADP jobs report earlier this week, which reported 37,000 new jobs compared to economists' expectations of 110,000. While the May jobs report showed higher-than-expected job growth, April and March numbers saw significant downward revisions.A correction could present a potential buying opportunity, but that's only if recession risks dissipate, Kolanovic said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

On Thursday, the firm warned incoming juniors not to accept future-dated jobs from buyout firms. Those who do will be terminated, the bank said in a memo.JPMorgan is warning junior bankers against taking future-dated jobs with buyout firms — or even sneaking out of job training to take interviews. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase's top investment banking brass sent a memo to incoming first-year IB analysts warning them against participating in the private equity industry's annual recruiting ritual. This whirlwind affair is known as \"on-cycle recruiting\" and promises young bankers lucrative jobs at the end of their investment banking analyst programs, which often last two or three years. In the memo, John Simmons and Filippo Gori, co-heads of global banking, admonished analysts who accept \"future-dated job offer\" or \"a position with another company before joining us\" within their first 18 months of employment, saying they will be terminated if discovered.\"You will be provided notice and your employment with the firm will end,\" the executives wrote. They said such offers could constitute a conflict for junior bankers working on transactions for PE sponsors who could also be their future employers. This year's memo appears to be an escalation of a long-simmering personnel issue important to the bank's high-profile CEO, Jamie Dimon. \"I think that's unethical. I don't like it, and I may eliminate it regardless of what the private-equity guys say,\" Dimon told college students at Georgetown University last year.Last year, the firm warned incoming junior bankers against the practice, but stopped short of saying it would terminate those who participated.This year's memo even vowed to terminate junior bankers who dare sneak out of job training to interview with private equity firms, as many did in 2023. \"To succeed in the Investment Banking Analyst Program, your full attention and participation are essential,\" wrote Simmons and Gori. \"Attendance at all training sessions, meetings and obligations is required. Missing any part of the training program may lead to removal from the program and termination,\" they said. The memo was first reported by ExecSum, a newsletter offshoot of the popular Instagram account Litquidity. A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed its authenticity to BI.As Business Insider has previously reported, private equity's annual recruiting of junior bankers is a frenetic affair that often starts without warning. Young bankers can be asked to drop everything to interview or miss out — resulting in middle-of-the-night interviews or missed vacations and proving a nagging source of disruption for bank bosses. Dimon has railed against PE recruiting and its impact on his staff. \"I think it's wrong to put you in the position,\" he said in the fall, adding: \"You have to kind of decide the next career move before you have a chance to even decide what the company is like.\"It remains to be seen how this new rule could impact the future of buyside recruiting. The industry insiders who spoke to BI expressed skepticism over the bank's ability to enforce the new rule.\"I imagine while some junior bankers will be scared off, many will continue to take the risk,\" Anthony Keizner, a partner at the headhunting firm Odyssey Search Partners, told BI on Thursday. \"They always saw banking as a stepping stone, and won't want to be put off starting the next phase of their career.\"A former junior banker who now works in private equity agreed.\"Analysts are going to recruit regardless,\" this person said, adding that young bankers will simply \"shut their mouths about\" it. In what appears to be an acknowledge of the competitive pressures young people in the industry face, the bank said in the memo that it would shorten its analyst program from three years to two and a half, offering juniors \"quicker advancement opportunities within the firm.\"\"All the mega funds already fill spots within the first six months,\" said the private equity professional, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her job. \"They're not going to wait for JPM analysts.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Outside the JPMorgan headquarters in Manhattan.Momo Takahashi / Business InsiderJamie Dimon has criticized the private equity industry's recruiting of its junior bankers.

JPMorgan Chase plans to offer financing to clients using spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (June 4). [contact-form-7] The decision applies globally across both retail and institutional segments and reflects the bank’s growing acceptance of regulated crypto exposure in mainstream finance. Clients’ holdings in crypto ETFs will now count toward net worth and liquidity calculations, placing them alongside stocks and real estate in eligibility assessments. The move expands on JPMorgan’s prior case-by-case approach and follows similar digital asset initiatives from other banks, including Morgan Stanley. The change comes amid a broader shift in regulatory tone under the current administration. Spot bitcoin ETFs — approved in January 2024 — now collectively manage over $128 billion in assets, making them among the most successful ETF launches in U.S. history. The development also reflects a sharp pivot for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been publicly skeptical of bitcoin, only offering clients access to the cryptocurrency last month. Speaking at the firm’s investor day in May, Dimon said: “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it.” While JPMorgan does not currently offer custody or execution services for crypto ETFs, the new lending policy positions the bank to capitalize on growing institutional demand for digital asset integration. It also mirrors broader industry trends identified in PYMNTS’ latest coverage on how banks are shifting from zero crypto exposure to enabling new forms of digital asset utility.

That means the GOP's federal spending bill, if signed into law, could directly impact his businesses.While Musk has previously shared his disapproval of the bill, the billionaire ratcheted up his criticism this week.\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk posted on X on Tuesday. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\"\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said in criticism aimed at the Republican politicians who voted in favor of the bill.Musk's sharp words for Trump's bill come just days after he officially left his position as the de facto head of the DOGE office, ending his formal work at the White House. In recent weeks, both Trump and Musk have looked to assure the public that their relationship remains intact, even if they disagree on some issues.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing on Tuesday that the President already knew where Musk stood on the spending bill and that the Tesla CEO's recent comments criticizing it wouldn't change Trump's stance.The bill, which champions Trump's agenda, includes cuts to Medicaid and the extension of the tax cuts that the president signed into law during his first term in 2017. It also includes administration priorities, including removing taxes on tips and overtime.In regard to the companies Musk leads, the bill could have a mixed impact. While Tesla stands to potentially lose, companies like SpaceX and xAI may benefit from the president's massive spending bill.Tesla's credits threatenedThe bill, as written, makes big changes to the Biden-era EV tax credits, which aim to encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles. It would largely phase out the clean vehicle credit, which lets people buying a new EV claim up to $7,500, and up to $4,000 for used-EVs.Electric vehicles would no longer qualify for the tax credit if the automaker sold more than 200,000 previously qualifying EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, if the bill became law. Tesla delivered more than 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 alone.Musk has previously said that eliminating the EV tax credit would devastate Tesla's competitors and impact the automaker as well. However, he said that the move would probably help Tesla in the long term.Others don't seem sold on Musk's rationale.Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, told BI that the expedited elimination of the EV tax credit will be \"the biggest area that could impact Tesla.\"\"Consumers have increased long range EV choices at similar price points as Tesla,\" Goldstein said. \"It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs.\"Goldstein said that tax credit elimination could lead to a decrease in sales volume, which the automaker has already been struggling with.JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in an investor note that Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" combined with other proposed legislation, including ending the California Air Resources Board Program, threatens over half of Tesla's 2025 profits.Brinkman wrote in the note that the $7,500 consumer tax made up 19% of Tesla's 2024 earnings before interest and tax, and could result in a potential $1.2 billion headwind. He added that the automaker could face a $2 billion headwind from the removal of CARB ZEV credit sales, which encourage the sales of zero-emission vehicles.Tesla is betting big on AI and robotics as it pushes to reach full autonomy, in part through its upcoming robotaxi service, efforts that Musk has said are key to growing the company's valuation. However, Brinkman said that any material benefit from Tesla's autonomous robotaxi business is years away, while the headwind from EV subsidy removal would likely hit the automaker in 2025 and 2026.\"We expect estimates to come down as the impact of Trump Administration EV subsidy removal becomes clearer,\" Brinkman wrote.Goldstein said that the removal of the tax credit could \"accelerate\" Tesla's transition to an AI and robotics company.It's also possible that the expiration of the EV tax credit on Tesla vehicles could spur some short-term demand from buyers looking to purchase one of the company's EVs before the window closes.Trump's spending bill wouldn't only change existing taxes and fees. Under its current language, it would also impose a $250 yearly fee for EV drivers through the Federal Highway Administration, and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.As written, the bill also scraps a loan program that Tesla utilized in 2010, long before Trump even entered the political scene.The spending bill also threatens Tesla's energy business, which Musk has said is \"growing like wildfire,\" by ending energy tax credits. The automaker's energy generation and storage business, which includes Tesla's Megapack and Powerwall battery systems, brought in $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 67% increase from the year prior.Musk shared a post on X from the official Tesla Energy account that said, \"abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid.\"Tesla Energy also added that it urges the Senate to enact legislation with a \"sensible wind down\" to continue speedy deployment that supports AI and domestic manufacturing.\"This bill would hurt Tesla around the energy tax credits going away,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and a noted Tesla bull, told BI.xAI may benefit from AI regulation changesTrump's spending bill, if signed into law, may also help his AI company, xAI.One section of the bill prohibits states and local governments from regulating AI for the next decade in an effort to remove legal barriers related to deploying and adopting AI.That could allow Musk to develop and advance xAI with less red tape on the regulatory side to slow the company down.The bill also allocated funds toward modernizing the federal IT system with AI and improving the cybersecurity of its systems. With the government setting money aside to improve its systems, xAI, one of the companies at the forefront of the AI race, could be contracted to power the modernization efforts.Read the original article on Business Insider Elon Musk referred to Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" as a \"disgusting abomination.\"Allison ROBBERT / AFPElon Musk's companies may be affected both positively and negatively by Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"A JPMorgan analyst wrote in a note that the bill threatens Tesla's profits.The bill would increase federal AI spending, which could benefit Musk's AI company, xAI.Tesla could take a hit if President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" becomes law.Elon Musk's AI company, however, may get a boost.Many of Musk's companies rely largely on federal regulations, subsidies, or contracts.

JPMorgan Chase did not immediately […] The post Report: JPMorgan Chase Appoints Marianne Lake to Head Overseas Consumer Banking appeared first on PYMNTS.com. JPMorgan Chase has reportedly given Marianne Lake, the head of its consumer and community banking division, the additional responsibility of overseeing its overseas consumer banking arm and strategic growth office. The move followed the departure of Sanoke Viswanathan, who resigned to become CEO of FactSet, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (June 3), citing a JPMorgan Chase internal memo. JPMorgan Chase did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, Lake is a leading contender to one day succeed JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Viswanathan had been seen as another possible successor, before his departure. “Sanoke has made an indelible and positive impact on JPMorgan Chase, and we have greatly benefited from his entrepreneurial mindset,” Dimon and JPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto wrote in the memo, per the report. JPMorgan’s consumer offering in the U.K. has 2.5 million customers and is “set to expand” to continental Europe, the report said, citing the memo. Reuters, which also reported on the JPMorgan Chase memo and the executives’ moves, said Viswanathan was with the bank for more than a decade and was a member of its operating committee. He is set to join FactSet in September. In a Tuesday press release from FactSet, Viswanathan said he was drawn to the company by its role in global financial markets and its ability to create value for clients. “I look forward to supporting the evolution of FactSet’s unique value proposition as a leading data and workflow solutions provider, and delivering new products and services to drive sustainable growth,” Viswanathan said. Lake served as JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer before being named the CEO of the bank’s consumer lending business in April 2019. It was reported at the time that her appointment to a role in which she would gain more direct experience in running a business unit within the company suggested that Lake was an heir apparent for Dimon’s role. On Monday (June 2), it was reported that Dimon told Fox Business that his retirement is “several years away.” “Obviously, it’s always up to God and the board,” Dimon said. “We’ve got some great people. There will be an appropriate time.” The post Report: JPMorgan Chase Appoints Marianne Lake to Head Overseas Consumer Banking appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said his retirement is “several years away.” Asked about his plans by Marie Bartiromo during an appearance on Fox Business’ Mornings With Maria that aired Monday (June 2), Dimon also said he may remain at the bank for a couple of years as chairman, executive chairman or a similar role. “Obviously, it’s always up to God and the board,” Dimon said. “We’ve got some great people. There will be an appropriate time.” He later added: “I love what I do, I love my country, and I don’t know what I’d do if I wasn’t fighting for something every day.” Dimon is 69 years old and has been JPMorgan Chase’s CEO for nearly 20 years, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday. He said last year that he would retire in five years — a statement that surprised investors, according to the report. The statement also set off speculation about who might succeed him and made the bank’s investor day in May “an audition of sorts” for the CEO role, the report said. The JPMorgan Chase board of directors said in an April 2024 proxy statement that planning for an orderly CEO transition “in the medium-term” was one of its top priorities. “As part of successful planning, the board continues to oversee management’s development of several operating committee members who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon,” the proxy statement said. In January 2024, JPMorgan Chase said in a press release that it made several changes to its leadership and organizational structure while working to “position the firm for the future.” “The senior management changes and new alignments announced today will help the company serve clients even better as well as further develop the company’s most senior leaders,” the release said. During the appearance on Fox Business that aired Monday, Dimon also said he is not complacent, because JPMorgan Chase faces competition from other major investment banks and commercial banks as well as FinTech companies like Stripe, PayPal and Revolut. “I always look at the ones who are doing better than us, and why,” Dimon said. “I don’t just focus on how well we’re doing.” The post JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Says Retirement ‘Several Years Away’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The S&P 500's strong May performance may be derailed by stagflation pressures, JPMorgan warns. A person works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Monday, March 31, 2025.Seth Wenig/APJPMorgan warns S&P 500 gains could slow due to US-China trade tensions and stagflation.Slow growth and rising inflation could set the backdrop for a stagflationary episode.JPMorgan flagged five headwinds for investors to monitor in the market.May was a strong month for the market, with the S&P 500 marking its best monthly performance since November 2023, but JPMorgan isn't confident that the winning streak will continue. The bank sees renewed US-China trade tensions, softening consumer sentiment, and growing chatter around the \"S-word\" — stagflation — as signs that the stock market's momentum will slow this summer.\"Post the recent bounce, we think softer leg is in store next, which could resemble a bit of a stagflationary episode, and during which trade negotiations play out,\" JPMorgan equity strategists, led by Mislav Matejka, wrote in a note on Monday. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also recently flagged the risk of stagflation, which economists have said can be worse than a recession. That's because central bankers would be unable to stimulate growth by lowering interest rates due to fears of exacerbating inflation. Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist, also thinks the groundwork for stagflation has already been laid.JPMorgan identified five headwinds for stocks that investors should be on the lookout for. The gap between soft and hard dataWhile recent inflation prints have started to come down closer to the Fed's 2% target, consumer sentiment has been weak, indicating a disparity between backwards-looking economic data and forward-looking sentiment. Many on Wall Street are also skeptical that cooler inflation is a durable trend, and strategists suspect inflation is likely to pick up in the back half of this year as tariffs are felt in the economy more fully. JPMorgan believes there's room for the soft data to deteriorate further after consumers and businesses front-loaded purchases in the beginning of the year. \"Past front-loading of orders in the run-up to tariffs is likely to have a payback, there will be some weakening in consumer due to squeeze in purchasing power, and even with dramatic backpedalling, the current tariffs picture is worse than most thought at the start of the year,\" the bank wrote.Bond yields could creep back upIncreased inflation concerns, combined with the growing deficit, could send bond yields rising and stall a rally. The Moody's downgrade of the US debt and Trump's tax bill, which is projected to add trillions to the deficit, have caused bond yields to spike in recent weeks, while deficit concerns could also lead to a weaker US dollar.The 10-year US Treasury yield is about 4.4%, down from recent spikes, but JPMorgan believes it's likely that bond yields move up again due to inflationary pressures. According to a survey of institutional investors conducted by Evercore ISI, 45% of respondents said a 10-year yield of 4.75% would halt stock market gains.Downwards earnings revisionsLooking forward, the Wall Street consensus on earnings-per-share growth seems overly optimistic, JPMorgan said. Consensus estimates project 10% growth this year and 14% growth next year, which the bank believes is too aggressive. Expect negative EPS revisions to materialize, the bank predicts. Higher input costs and interest costs are likely to eat into profit margins. Historically, S&P 500 earnings growth has required above 2% GDP growth, which is unlikely in a period of stagflation. US stocks remain expensiveAt 22x, the forward price-to-earnings of the S&P 500 is elevated, which might not be sustainable for the long term in light of inflation and tariff concerns.International stocks were a bright spot in the market as tariff concerns roiled the S&P 500, and JPMorgan thinks international strength could continue. While US stocks have typically been the best performers in times of market volatility, the bank believes stagflationary pressures could allow international stocks to shine.\"If markets relapse into weakness, the US has typically held up better than other regions during risk-off periods, but this time around Tech and USD might not be the 'safe' havens,\" the bank wrote.US households hold record amounts of stockRetail investors have been flooding the market recently as they buy the dip, but retail enthusiasm could be a contrarian signal for the stock market, as it's often seen as a sign that the market is overbought. Right now, US households' stock ownership is approaching 30% of total assets, higher than the peak in 2000 before the dot-com crash. JPMorganJPMorganRead the original article on Business Insider",

The people we spoke to include recent interns who are starting investment banking jobs or now work in private equity, as well as some who are still students but live in New York.They told Business Insider that summer analysts will be spending most of their time in their office. That's because the No. 1 goal of an investment banking internship is to get an offer for a full-time job after graduation, known as a \"return offer.\" To do that, interns have to prove their work ethic and commitment — often by joining the full-time junior bankers in clocking in 80- to 100-hour workweeks.\"I don't think I ever went outside of the office except to sleep that summer,\" one second-year investment banker said of their intern experience.Still, it's summer — and even busy interns would be wise to find time to network with other future rainmakers. So where will they be in the few hours a week they manage to break away from Excel spreadsheets and the whims of their bosses?From bars and clubs to coffee shops — here are 5 spots (plus a few honorable mentions) where you'll be sure to find Wall Street interns this summer in New York City.Brass MonkeyThe outdoor patio of Brass Monkey viewed from The High Line above the Meatpacking District in 2017.George Rose/Getty ImagesThis bar was mentioned most among BI's sources. Four industry insiders, from newly anointed bankers who were interns last summer to more senior professionals, said Brass Monkey was popular among finance interns. It's in the trendy Meatpacking District on Manhattan's west side, and offers three indoor bars plus a rooftop terrace.An incoming investment banker who interned last summer in NYC described it as a popular place to begin a night out \"for people going to and from dinner in the West Village\" and other nearby hot spots.\"The first Friday and Saturday night, the line is crazy long. It's so funny,\" said an incoming intern who lives in New York.The food menu offers standard American bar fare like nachos, chicken tenders, and buffalo wings, while the drink list features a ton of beers and $16 cocktails with names like \"Summer Stock\" and \"Swizzle Me Timbers.\"Phebe's TavernPhebe's Tavern at 361 Bowery Street near New York University's campus.Phebe's NYCFour people told us about Phebe's, an East Village spot that's been around since 1968. It's an eatery during the day, offering standard bar fare, but also pasta and steak. (It also randomly claims itself as the top bar for Cincinnati Bengals fans in NYC.) But it's open until 4 a.m. on the weekends, when it turns into a \"known intern bar,\" according to a former junior banker who works in private equity.Indeed, this spot has been featured in plenty of memes on Wall Street social media pages and online forums, including Instagram account Overheard on Wall Street.\"It's an early-in-the-night spot that just fills up with interns,\" said the person who previously worked at a bulge bracket investment bank. \"It's right next to the Bowery Hotel and always full of early-20s people running around everywhere.\"Hair of the DogHair of the Dog at night in the Lower East Side in 2021.Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesEstablished in 2012, Hair of the Dog describes itself as a place \"where old school watering hole meets big time sports bar\" on Manhattan's Lower East Side.\"It's a pub slash spots bar vibe for all the finance bros to hit,\" said a person who previously worked at a bulge bracket investment bank.The incoming investment banker described it as a late-night spot for interns and people in their early 20s, saying it's \"small, crammed, loud,\" with \"old/new music mixes in a grungy location.\"Blue Bottle & Black Fox coffee chainsBlue Bottle coffee shop in Los AngelesThomson ReutersNetworking is a must for Wall Street interns, who are eager to make a lasting impression in an effort to score a full-time job. That tends to lead to 1-1 coffees with employees and managers during the work day. The people who spoke to BI said there are two go-to networking hotspots for the finance ilk, both of them coffee chains.Black Fox Coffee is a New York company with three Manhattan locations — one of which is particularly popping with bankers.\"For midtown/Park Ave people, Black Fox Coffee at 550 Madison is popular for chats,\" said the former junior banker who works in private equity.This person also mentioned Blue Bottle Coffee, a cafe chain that got its start in California, but which now has about 20 locations in the New York metro area. This chain is more ubiquitous, but you'll find the most finance folks at the ones closest to office hubs — like in Midtown on 52nd Street. (It's even been a standout for this Business Insider reporter to catch up with industry sources across Manhattan.)Swingers & Spin sports venuesMark Zuckerberg playing ping pong at Spin in 2017.SpinWhile their names may conjure up images of promiscuous night clubs, Swingers is an indoor mini golf course and Spin is a \"ping pong social club,\" according to its website. The people who spoke to BI said they're spots for team events (the kind that companies will put on and pay for) in the summer.\"We would just have random intern social events there,\" said the former junior banker who works in private equity.Some honorable mentionsThree men sitting an outdoor bar in Manhattan.Lisa Blue/ GettyHonorable mentions included Mr. Purple, another rooftop bar on the Lower East Side that a former junior banker who works in private equity described as a \"classic meme-y NYC club.\" It's \"a place for interns to feel like they can see and be seen,\" added the person who previously worked at a bulge-bracket investment bank.Pianos, yet another Lower East Side bar, \"has live music and usually a line out the door of people who are way too young,\" said the person who previously worked at a bulge bracket investment bank.Read the original article on Business Insider Outside the JPMorgan headquarters in Manhattan.Momo Takahashi / Business InsiderJune marks the start of many summer internship programs on Wall Street.BI asked industry insiders where interns hang out when they're not pulling all-nighters.From bars to coffee shops, see 5 top places summer interns will go to see and be seen this summer.In the next two weeks, hundreds of college students will descend upon New York City to begin summer jobs on Wall Street.To kick off the annual ritual, we asked half a dozen industry insiders to tell us the top hangouts for Wall Street interns, known for planning out their career paths years in advance.We focused on New York City because it's the financial capital of the world, boasting top investment banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley.

So where will they be in the few hours a week they manage to break away from Excel spreadsheets and the whims of their bosses?From bars and clubs to coffee shops — here are 5 spots (plus a few honorable mentions) where you'll be sure to find Wall Street interns this summer in New York City.Brass MonkeyThe outdoor patio of Brass Monkey viewed from The High Line above the Meatpacking District in 2017.George Rose/Getty ImagesThis bar was mentioned most among BI's sources. Four industry insiders, from newly anointed bankers who were interns last summer to more senior professionals, said Brass Monkey was popular among finance interns. It's in the trendy Meatpacking District on Manhattan's west side, and offers three indoor bars plus a rooftop terrace.An incoming investment banker who interned last summer in NYC described it as a popular place to begin a night out \"for people going to and from dinner in the West Village\" and other nearby hot spots.\"The first Friday and Saturday night, the line is crazy long. It's so funny,\" said an incoming intern who lives in New York.The food menu offers standard American bar fare like nachos, chicken tenders, and buffalo wings, while the drink list features a ton of beers and $16 cocktails with names like \"Summer Stock\" and \"Swizzle Me Timbers.\"Phebe's TavernPhebe's Tavern at 361 Bowery Street near New York University's campus.Phebe's NYCFour people told us about Phebe's, an East Village spot that's been around since 1968. It's an eatery during the day, offering standard bar fare, but also pasta and steak. (It also randomly claims itself as the top bar for Cincinnati Bengals fans in NYC.) But it's open until 4 a.m. on the weeke",

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly said Friday (May 30) that after excessive spending by the U.S. government and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, a crack in the bond market is “going to happen.” Speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon said, per a Bloomberg report, “I just don’t know if it’s going to be a crisis in six months or six years, and I’m hoping that we change both the trajectory of the debt and the ability of market makers to make markets.” Dimon added that a crack in the bond market may be what it takes to “wake us up,” according to the report. The report said that U.S. treasuries are headed for their first monthly loss this year and that concerns about the country’s budget deficit increased amid lawmakers’ debates over the tax bill. Dimon said May 19 that the markets have not accounted for the risks of inflation, stagflation, credit spreads tariffs and other challenges. He said the chances of inflation and stagflation are greater than people think; credit spreads haven’t accounted for a potential downturn; the impact of tariffs is difficult to predict; and geopolitical risks are high. Speaking after the markets had recovered from declines seen when the Trump administration announced tariff policies and when Moody’s Ratings downgraded the country’s credit rating from its top level, Dimon said: “The market came down 10%, it’s back up 10%; I think that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.” In April, Dimon said the country’s tariffs will likely trigger a recession. Dimon said a recession is “probably a likely outcome” and that he was “taking a calm view … but I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here.” Friday’s Bloomberg report said that Dimon’s comments on the bond market echoed a prediction he made a month earlier that there will be a “kerfuffle” in the Treasury market that will lead to intervention by the Fed. On Friday, Dimon said that he tells regulators that a crisis will happen and the regulators will panic, adding of JPMorgan Chase, “I’m not going to panic. We’ll be fine.” The post Jamie Dimon: Government Spending Will Cause ‘Crisis’ in Bond Market appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Apollo Global Management is reportedly working with five banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group, to trade private credit. The collaboration will enable Apollo and its partners to syndicate investment grade debt on a larger scale, with the banks acting as broker-dealers, Bloomberg reported Thursday (May 29). With the extra liquidity, Apollo will be able to originate larger loans and continue helping individual clients who need to redeem their investments more often than institutions, according to the report. The collaboration came as Apollo has been working to build a marketplace for private credit deals and to increase the number of buyers on the secondary market, the report said. Banks have also planned to build trading desks for this market, per the report. Big banks have detailed the lure of private credit and their longer-term plans in the space, PYMNTS reported in October. Over several months, there have been announcements between banks and private equity firms that have sought to link up with private equity outfits and gain a share of the estimated $1.7 trillion private credit industry. The private credit market has been booming as it offers a capital “lifeline” of sorts to a variety of borrowers, especially smaller firms that have been, or still are, underserved as they seek capital from traditional markets. Private lending may also be extended to firms that are backed by private equity vehicles. The capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter’s end customers isincreasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across the spectrum, PYMNTS reported May 9. A report by the Boston Fed showed that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions, a category that includes private equity and private credit. It was reported in September that Apollo and State Street were launching a private-public credit exchange-trade fund that will hold mostly investment-grade debt, including private credit originated by Apollo. The report noted that retail investors are expected to become a much larger purchaser of alternative investments like private credit, citing estimates from consultancy Cerulli Associates, which estimated that financial advisers will increase their holdings of such investments from $1.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion by the end of 2025.

JPMorganChase is accelerating the rollout of the affluent banking offering it introduced late last year. Two of these J.P. Morgan Financial Centers opened in late 2024, and now 14 more will officially open this week, the bank said in a Tuesday (May 27) press release. The bank plans to continue adding J.P. Morgan Financial Centers and to have 31 in operation by the end of 2026, according to the release. “Through these Financial Centers, we are redefining how affluent clients are served, offering a highly personalized level of service that is backed by the global capabilities of JPMorganChase,” Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking, said in the release. This new branch format is designed to cater to the needs of affluent clients by providing private meeting spaces, distinctive finishes, personalized support from a dedicated senior private client banker, and a full range of banking and wealth management offerings, according to the release. The J.P. Morgan Financial Centers opening this week are in four states: California, Florida, Massachusetts and New York, per the release. Most are former First Republic locations that JPMorganChase acquired in May 2023. The first two Financial Centers were opened in October in New York City and San Francisco, according to an Oct. 16 press release. “When we meet with clients, they consistently say they want a relationship that spans across banking, lending and investments, and provides a seamless experience as they navigate the complexities of managing and growing wealth,” Roberts said in the Tuesday press release. JPMorganChase acquired essentially all of the assets of First Republic Bank in May 2023 after First Republic’s collapse and takeover by regulators. The bank’s presentation materials that accompanied an analyst call at the time showed that the deal would accelerate JPMorgan’s exposure to high-net-worth clients. It was reported in February that JPMorganChase’s integration of First Republic Bank was progressing according to plan and that while the bank intended to close 30 branches out of the approximately 60 it acquired, it was working on transforming over 20 locations into J.P. Morgan branches with distinct branding and design, catering to affluent clients.

Each week, the evolution of the ongoing cryptocurrency-FinTech convergence seems to get another headline to hang its hat on. Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin. This week, it is the news Tuesday (May 27) that Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Circle is hoping for a valuation of $5.65 billion with an offering price target of $24 to $26 per share. The lead underwriters are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle’s pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments. Circle’s goal for its IPO is to position itself favorably to become the financial utility layer of the internet. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) for money movement or a SWIFT network reimagined for digital assets. To get there, Circle may need to evolve beyond being a stablecoin issuer. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost. See also: Keeping Stablecoins Stable is Complicated: Why CFOs Need to Pay Attention Stablecoin Competition Is Getting Crowded The stablecoin arena is no longer the wild frontier it once was. Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. Tether remains the volume leader globally, especially outside the United States. Circle’s edge lies in its U.S.-compliant stance and focus on transparency and fiat backing. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises. Circle’s S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. In 2024, the company earned $1.68 billion in total revenue, with 99% of that coming from interest income on reserves backing USDC. That figure underscores how tightly Circle’s fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy. As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle’s revenue. According to its filing, a 1% drop in rates could slash income by as much as $441 million. Stablecoins have started to decouple themselves from crypto exchanges and position themselves as a component of real-world financial infrastructure, PYMNTS reported in March. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April. Read also: Smaller Banks Face Urgent Crypto Decisions Regulation Remains Crypto’s Looming Wildcard Circle’s IPO plans can also be seen as a part of a broader movement among other major crypto firms seeking to capitalize on a more pro-crypto, pro-business regulatory climate under the President Donald Trump administration. The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, the country’s first stablecoin legislation, is proceeding through the Senate amid recognition in Washington that stablecoins are too big to ignore. Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. The Circle S-1 flags multiple legal risks, but chief among them is the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins. To diversify its business model, Circle this month brought the Circle Payments Network (CPN) live. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains. Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico.

        "description": "JPMorgan's asset and wealth management CEO, Mary Callahan Erdoes, talked about how AI is helping advisors anticipate clients' needs.Heidi Gutman/CNBCJPMorgan is scaling AI tools across various business lines.At its Investor Day, the bank's leaders shared how AI is changing workflows across its main businesses.JPMorgan's tech spending is $18 billion, focusing on AI, machine learning, and cloud.When JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum recently took some time to experiment with \"vibe coding,\" he was amazed.Computer scientists at the firm told him that using plain-language prompts to generate code with AI — known as vibe coding — has improved their efficiency, too. Barnum told investors and analysts at JPMorgan's 2025 Investor Day on Monday. \"We have high hopes for the efficiency gains we might get,\" he added.Barnum's remarks on how artificial intelligence is reengineering workflows were far from the only mention of how technology is reshaping America's largest bank. From fraud detection and call center automation to portfolio management and wealth advice, AI is no longer something the bank is just experimenting with through pilot projects; it's now scaling its tools and seeing measurable results.The first step in adopting AI technology across the firm was rolling out its proprietary, in-house generative AI platform to over 200,000 employees. It has about 100 genAI tools in the pipeline, too, according to Barnum's presentation.\"Certain key subsets of the users tell us they are gaining several hours a week of productivity, and almost by definition, the time savings is coming from less valuable tasks,\" Barnum said.The firm's spending outlook for technology is $18 billion, up by $1 billion year over year — the highest among Wall Street banks. As AI, machine learning, and cloud innovation lower the barrier to new features and tools, speed is critical to staying competitive, Barnum said. It's also a way to keep costs down going forward, especially on the hiring front.\"We were early movers in AI,\" the CFO said. \"But we're still in the early stages of the journey.\"Here's how that journey is taking shape—business line by business line.Consumer & Community BankingBefore turning it over to Marianne Lake, CEO of JPMorgan's consumer and community bank, Barnum talked about how AI was being used by the unit's call centers, helping agents service customers more efficiently by anticipating customers' needs or quickly responding to questions.Lake, the next speaker of the day, followed by saying that the bank reduced servicing costs by nearly 30% in part because of AI, but also because of \"good old-fashioned\" process automation and organizational efficiency.\"The operations team is at the tip of the spear on using and leveraging new AI tools and capabilities,\" she said.She predicted a 10% head count reduction in operations with the help of AI, a division focused on fraud, statement, payment processing, and account services.\"I would take the over on this projection, and I'll bet we will deliver even more as the tools and capabilities just keep getting better and better.\"Lake detailed the consumer and community banking unit's $9 billion tech investment.JPMorganThe technology has also played a \"very significant\" part in reducing fraud, even as hackers and cyberattacks become more sophisticated.The bank is now looking at ways to use technology to continue personalizing what people see when they open their mobile phone apps in hopes of better promoting relevant products and services. Personalizing for to people's interests and behaviors has helped increase engagement rates by 25% so far, she said.Asset & Wealth ManagementIn wealth and asset management, AI is not just a tool, Mary Callahan Erdoes, the unit's CEO, told the audience. \"It's reimagining workflows and it's changing the loading capacities for thousands of people on the front line and in the back,\" she said.Portfolio managers and analysts at JPMorgan are using Smart Monitor, which the firm has estimated helps reduce time researching a topic by 83% by pulling in data from earnings calls, market moves, and filings, generating tailored alerts and analysis.\"I thought that you would be the last people to use this stuff because you think 'I'm too smart for AI, and I have to do it my way,'\" she said, speaking to the investors in the room. \"It saves so much time.\"JPMorganShe said the tool that's caught the most attention is Connect Coach. The program, which prompts suggestions or recommendations to a wealth manager in real time, was rolled out to private bankers last year, Business Insider reported, and in the last week, it was launched to the banks' 7,600 wealth management advisors.If a JPMorgan private banker hears from the bank's top researcher about European stocks in a meeting, the tool automatically pulls up who in the banker's client book does not have exposure, Erdoes explained. It'll bring up fund fact sheets, sample emails, or talking points to call clients with.Advisory productivity is up 3.4 times, thanks to the firm's investments in technology, she said.Commercial & Investment BankAI is being deployed across the workflow in JPMorgan's investment bank, from onboarding new clients — where costs to verify clients are down 40% — to client insights and portfolio optimization, Doug Petno, co-CEO of the commercial and investment bank, said.He added that the bank now has over 175 AI use cases in production, focusing on predictive analytics and operational efficiency, including helping its bankers with risk—based decision-making.In its payments business, the firm has used AI and machine learning models to reduce friction in payment transactions. Umar Farooq, cohead of JPMorgan's payments business, said that in the past few years, transaction volumes have gone up by more than 50%. Part of that is down to AI models cutting down on transactions that require human intervention to be resolved, often caused by things like account number mismatches or failed fraud detection checks.\"This is just a small example of how our dataset will be to the future of our business as we expand and lean ever more so into technologies like Generative AI,\" Umar Farooq, cohead of JPMorgan Payments, said.Read the original article on Business Insider JPMorgan's asset and wealth management CEO, Mary Callahan Erdoes, talked about how AI is helping advisors anticipate clients' needs.Heidi Gutman/CNBCJPMorgan is scaling AI tools across various business lines.At its Investor Day, the bank's leaders shared how AI is changing workflows across its main businesses.JPMorgan's tech spending is $18 billion, focusing on AI, machine learning, and cloud.When JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum recently took some time to experiment with \"vibe coding,\" he was amazed.Computer scientists at the firm told him that using plain-language prompts to generate code with AI — known as vibe coding — has improved their efficiency, too. Barnum told investors and analysts at JPMorgan's 2025 Investor Day on Monday. \"We have high hopes for the efficiency gains we might get,\" he added.Barnum's remarks on how artificial intelligence is reengineering workflows were far from the only mention of how technology is reshaping America's largest bank. From fraud detection and call center automation to portfolio management and wealth advice, AI is no longer something the bank is just experimenting with through pilot projects; it's now scaling its tools and seeing measurable results.The first step in adopting AI technology across the firm was rolling out its proprietary, in-house generative AI platform to over 200,000 employees. It has about 100 genAI tools in the pipeline, too, according to Barnum's presentation.\"Certain key subsets of the users tell us they are gaining several hours a week of productivity, and almost by definition, the time savings is coming from less valuable tasks,\" Barnum said.The firm's spending outlook for technology is $18 billion, up by $1 billion year over year — the highest among Wall Street banks. As AI, machine learning, and cloud innovation lower the barrier to new features and tools, speed is critical to staying competitive, Barnum said. It's also a way to keep costs down going forward, especially on the hiring front.\"We were early movers in AI,\" the CFO said. \"But we're still in the early stages of the journey.\"Here's how that journey is taking shape—business line by business line.Consumer & Community BankingBefore turning it over to Marianne Lake, CEO of JPMorgan's consumer and community bank, Barnum talked about how AI was being used by the unit's call centers, helping agents service customers more efficiently by anticipating customers' needs or quickly responding to questions.Lake, the next speaker of the day, followed by saying that the bank reduced servicing costs by nearly 30% in part because of AI, but also because of \"good old-fashioned\" process automation and organizational efficiency.\"The operations team is at the tip of the spear on using and leveraging new AI tools and capabilities,\" she said.She predicted a 10% head count reduction in operations with the help of AI, a division focused on fraud, statement, payment processing, and account services.\"I would take the over on this projection, and I'll bet we will deliver even more as the tools and capabilities just keep getting better and better.\"Lake detailed the consumer and community banking unit's $9 billion tech investment.JPMorganThe technology has also played a \"very significant\" part in reducing fraud, even as hackers and cyberattacks become more sophisticated.The bank is now looking at ways to use technology to continue personalizing what people see when they open their mobile phone apps in hopes of better promoting relevant products and services. Personalizing for to people's interests and behaviors has helped increase engagement rates by 25% so far, she said.Asset & Wealth ManagementIn wealth and asset management, AI is not just a tool, Mary Calla",

        "description": "The \"sell America\" trade hasn't waned among global investors surveyed by JPMorgan even as US stocks have rallied back after April's tariff chaos. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesSurveyed international investors are betting on European equities to beat out US stocks, JPMorgan said.The \"sell America\" trade has picked up steam amid policy, tariffs, and deficit fears.\"Sell America\" sentiment is growing among international investors, even as Wall Street forecasters see US markets bound to push past the worst-case scenarios.Investors from 45 countries surveyed at the JPMorgan Global Markets Conference this month revealed a bullish lean toward Europe, with 36% anticipating European equities to be the best-performing asset in 2025.That's compared to 17% who are betting on US stocks to dominate.JPMorgan\"There were mixed views on the outlook for the US economy, even if recession is no longer the base case, and investor sentiment was not as positive on growth as risk market trading suggests,\" a team of JPMorgan analysts wrote last week.The report, involving 700 investors from 45 countries, adds to other signs indicating that global investors have turned cautious on US markets after years of outperformance.While US equities have drawn heavy foreign investor flows as the market rallied in the last few years, high valuations, AI disruptions, and massive policy and data jitters have shaken faith in \"US exceptionalism.\"Meanwhile, new tailwinds are emerging for the European market, and investors have flocked to the region's stock market. The Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7% for the year, while the S&P 500 is down about 1%.However, though the stark difference in performance between the two markets may boost pro-European arguments, several Wall Street forecasters have cautioned against dumping US assets.Morgan Stanley recently projected that American dominance will remain intact through at least 2026, as near-term volatility gives way to improved earnings sentiment, continued AI gains, and accommodating policy boosts. In its view, slowing growth will not trigger a recession.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, suggested that US mega-caps will outperform again this year — the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks have been the S&P 500's main growth engine since 2023, and are trading at discounted valuations that investors will lean into, the bank said.For now, uncertain will remain until the market gets more clarity on everything from interest rates, recession odds, trade deals, and geopolitical developments. JPMorgan offered some takeaways from the conference on key issues:Recession: Odds of a US downturn now stand at 40%, but GDP damage is already done. Conference speakers cited that US tariffs will dent business investment and consumption. JPMorgan expects the 10-year Treasury yield to end 2025 at 4.35%.Trade negotiations mean more uncertainty: Easing tensions with China may have uplifted US investors' spirits, but a deal with the European Union looks contentious, JPMorgan said. Risk of retaliation is high if negotiations don't conclude favorably. That risk was amplified on Friday when Trump posted on Truth Social that he was recommending a 50% tariff on the EU starting June 1.Expect a longer bond sell-off: Foreign dumping of US debt should continue as inflation, attacks against central bank independence, and policy turmoil erode the Treasury market's safe haven appeal.As sovereign wealth funds and reserve managers rethink Treasury holdings, gold stands to benefit, JPMorgan said.\"A potential shift of just 0.5% of foreign US assets to gold could yield 18% annual returns, taking gold prices toward $6,000 by early 2029.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Jamie Dimon said he was preparing for a full range of scenarios, including stagflation. The JPMorgan boss has voiced other downbeat views in recent weeks. Jamie DimonTom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesJamie Dimon is ringing the alarm bells on the economy again.The JPMorgan CEO told Bloomberg that the US is at risk of a fate more worrying than a recession.He's worried about stagflation, a troubling combo of persistently high inflation and stagnant economic growth.The CEO of America's largest bank says he's preparing for a full range of economic scenarios, including one that economists think is an outcome worse than a recession.Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg on Thursday that he sees stagflation — a dire combination of high inflation and low growth — as still on the table for the US economy.\"I think there's a chance you'll have stagflation,\" Dimon said, adding that he's not predicting such a scenario necessarily but that he wants to be prepared.\"I think global fiscal deficits are inflationary. I think the remilitarization of the world is inflationary. The restructuring of trade is inflationary,\" he added, while also noting that the sharp decline in oil prices could be a deflationary offset.The JPMorgan boss also said he thinks the Federal Reserve was right to hold rates steady, given the risks to inflation from loosening monetary policy too early. The US central bank has kept interest rates unchanged this year, despite calls from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs.Dimon's latest economic warnings add to his other downbeat prognostications about the economy in recent weeks, even as many top banks and commentators adjust their outlooks following the recent progress on US-China trade negotiations.He warned last week that a recession was still on the table, and predicted that tariff-related volatility would continue to pressure markets.\"I think it's a mistake to think we can go through all the things we're going through and the volatility itself will come down,\" he said last week.Dimon struck a cautious tone at this week's JPMorgan investor day, as well, stating that markets have become much too complacent in the face of trade wars and other mounting geopolitical risks.On Thursday, Dimon also praised China. While he described himself as a \"full-throated, red-blooded American patriot capitalist,\" the banking chief said he recognized the \"enormous job\" China has done to help its people.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Shocker!)But perhaps Dimon's most interesting comments were about one of his biggest rivals: bitcoin.Despite his constant bashing of the digital asset, his bank will now allow clients to buy it. (They won't hold onto it for you, though.)\"I don't think you should smoke. But I defend your right to smoke,\" Dimon said.3 things in marketsJennifer Sor/BI1. Ross Gerber isn't sold on Tesla's recent rally. Shares of Elon Musk's EV maker were up 52% from recent lows, but Gerber still thinks it has further to fall. The early investor-turned-bear dumped more stock, citing three major issues with the company.2. US debt downgrade: disaster or distraction? Top Wall Street banks weigh in. Moody's slashed America's top-tier credit rating following concerns about the country's fiscal situation. The news rattled the markets on Monday, but Wall Street banks aren't bracing for a major volatility spike. They explained why.3. Would-be investors said no to OpenAI's nonprofit structure. In a letter to California's attorney general, the company said it lost out on \"many\" potential investors because it couldn't offer \"easy-to-understand\" equity. It plans to restructure as a Public Benefit Corporation.3 things in techOpenAI, Ava Horton/BI1. OpenAI's growing pains. ChatGPT turned the hot little startup into a household name overnight. With a sudden need to scale up, OpenAI went on a hiring frenzy that led it to double in size. The result was pure chaos. Read an excerpt from Karen Hao's new book about the world's most famous startup.2. This Yale student moonlights as a tech security watchdog. Alex Schapiro has caught bugs in startups and big companies, leading at least one to start its own bug bounty program. He's an ethical hacker — someone who looks for flaws in code before the bad guys can exploit them.3. AI and consulting are on a crash course with each other, and the Big Four could be the victim. Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG have dominated the services industry for decades, but AI could upend that. From business models to pricing structures, here's how AI could disrupt the Big Four's dominance.3 things in businessFrazer Harrison/Variety via Getty Images1. CBS News' CEO Wendy McMahon is out. In a memo sent to staff obtained by BI, McMahon cited disagreements with Paramount's path forward. Her exit follows longtime \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens' departure a month ago. Following news of the latest shake-up, Sen. Bernie Sanders warned Paramount Global's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, to \"not capitulate to Trump's attack on a free press.\"2. The pharma heir and the trial lawyer she says hoodwinked her. Claudia Engelhorn gave a $10 million \"gift\" to her former lawyer, Erik Bolog. Engelhorn says he tricked her into it; Bolog says she's retaliating because he called her out on what he says was a racist remark. Now, they're duking it out in court.3. Walmart just did other companies a favor. The retail giant's recent announcement to raise prices due to Trump's tariffs gave other companies the freedom to do the same, retail analysts told BI. But following Trump's Walmart backlash, companies might want to be careful with how they approach the price hike conversation.In other newsInstagram is offering creators up to $20,000 to bring people to the app.23andMe was once worth $6 billion.

        "description": "Hugh Morris started his own wealth management firm after quitting JP MorganHugh MorrisHugh Morris made just over $250,000 at JP Morgan before he left in August 2024 after his divorce.The 31-year-old said a higher-up told him he was making a big mistake leaving to start his own firm.Morris initially regretted his decision and had panic attacks, but now has his dream practice. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hugh Morris, the president and senior wealth advisor at The Morris Group at LPL Financial. Morris's prior employment and financials have been verified with documents. It has been edited for length and clarity.At 30 years old, I had been working as a financial advisor at JP Morgan Wealth Management for nearly three years, making just above $250,000.I loved the company, the people I worked with, and my job, but after getting divorced in January 2024, I had a reset.Since entering the workforce, I've always wanted my own business. As a young person with no partner, kids, or obligations, this was my opportunity to see if I could make it in the business world as a financial advisor.Additionally, I wanted the freedom to set my own schedule so I could volunteer and get involved in my community.I liked the idea of taking on the number and types of clients I wanted. With my own business, I could take on fewer clients than I managed at JP Morgan and make the same amount of money because I would take home all my fees.I also thought in 30 years' time, if I were making $1 or $2 million in revenue I could sell the business at three to four times that amount to fund my retirement.Preparing to quit my jobTo prepare for my resignation, I created a monthly budget of my essential costs. I used this as a guide for my savings, so I could cover myself if the business failed.My divorce was finalized in March 2024. We sold our house, ridding me of a $6,000 monthly house payment. I started renting, which cost less than $2,000 a month. I wanted to reduce my expenses, knowing that I would need to invest a lot of my own money into the business.Each month, I tried to save between $5,000 and $6,000. I wouldn't have any income initially, and I knew I needed a fund to supplement my income and pay for my living expenses.I also started networking with friends and family, thinking about where I would get my clients once I launched.My goal was to get to $10 million in assets at a 1% fee, which is about $100,000 in revenue, in the first year.I had panic attacks after I quitAfter months of planning, saving, and networking, I resigned in August 2024. A higher up said to me, \"This will be the biggest mistake of your life.\"That comment stuck with me. For three months after resigning, I had panic attacks and woke in the middle of the night, sweating, my heart racing. I couldn't sleep or eat.I thought about my old salary and the salary I could've been making had I stayed. Fears about bankruptcy crept in, and I thought about how I'd have to find a new career if this failed.Until December 2024, I regretted leaving JP Morgan, thinking I had done what my higher-up had predicted — made a big mistake.During the first two months of my business, I had zero income, living off the money I had saved in preparation. My first clients were family and friends, excited about my new venture, but it was difficult to grow my client list.My grandfather's encouragement got me through those first months. Every day, he told me: \"You can do this,\" and, \"It's going to work.\"I also didn't want to let down my new clients. They trusted me.It hasn't been easy starting a business, but I have more freedomDespite my fears, I stayed consistent. I didn't take a salary for the first two months, but by December, I was making an average of $1,500 a month from my assets under management fee.I got referrals from existing clients and learned how to market myself to get new clients. In January, I started paying a company to do my marketing.In March, I hired a business coach because I wanted to cut down my learning curve and grow my business faster. She helped me see that I had the skills to make my business successful.I expect to generate $100,000 in revenue in 2025 with around 40 clients.I still work between 40 and 60 hours a week, but set my own schedule and can volunteer in the middle of the day or leave early on a Friday.I've also had the freedom to spend more time with my clients at dinners or golfing. I like getting to know my clients and building trust with them. I want to personalise their experience.I occasionally feel lonely, working for myself, but I've built up a network of financial advisors in the same position as me. We talk or text often.My income is tied to the stock marketMy income is directly related to the stock market. I try to live as lean as possible and have a safety net to manage the current market volatility.I have future clients in the pipeline, which could boost my income, but they don't want to move over right now because of the economy.If the stock market is down 20%, my revenue will be down 20%. But it also works in reverse, when the market is up, I will get a bump in revenue.Despite the current economy, I no longer regret my decision to start my business. I've had enough initial wins to feel like I'm going to make it work. I have the practice I've dreamed about. There is no turning back.Editor's note: JP Morgan declined to comment when approached by Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider Hugh Morris started his own wealth management firm after quitting JP MorganHugh MorrisHugh Morris made just over $250,000 at JP Morgan before he left in August 2024 after his divorce.The 31-year-old said a higher-up told him he was making a big mistake leaving to start his own firm.Morris initially regretted his decision and had panic attacks, but now has his dream practice.

My first clients were family and friends, excited about my new venture, but it was difficult to grow my client list.My grandfather's encouragement got me through those first months. Every day, he told me: \"You can do this,\" and, \"It's going to work.\"I also didn't want to let down my new clients. They trusted me.It hasn't been easy starting a business, but I have more freedomDespite my fears, I stayed consistent. I didn't take a salary for the first two months, but by December, I was making an average of $1,500 a month from my assets under management fee.I got referrals from existing clients and learned how to market myself to get new clients. In January, I started paying a company to do my marketing.In March, I hired a business coach because I wanted to cut down my learning curve and grow my business faster. She helped me see that I had the skills to make my business successful.I expect to generate $100,000 in revenue in 2025 with around 40 clients.I still work between 40 and 60 hours a week, but set my own schedule and can volunteer in the middle of the day or leave early on a Friday.I've also had the freedom to spend more time with my clients at dinners or golfing. I like getting to know my clients and building trust with them. I want to perso",

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday (May 19) that the markets have not accounted for the risks of inflation, stagflation, credit spreads, tariffs and other challenges. Dimon said at the bank’s investor day that the chances of inflation and stagflation are greater than people think; credit spreads haven’t accounted for a potential downturn; the impact of tariffs is difficult to predict; and geopolitical risks are high, Bloomberg reported Monday. The report said markets have recovered from declines seen when the Trump administration announced tariff policies and when Moody’s Ratings downgraded the country’s credit rating from its top level. “People feel pretty good because you haven’t seen an effect of tariffs,” Dimon said during the event, per the report. “The market came down 10%, it’s back up 10%; I think that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.” It was reported Monday that despite economic uncertainty, JPMorgan Chase is projecting that it could earn more from interest payments this year. Jeremy Barnum, the bank’s chief financial officer, told investors that JPMorgan’s net interest income — the difference between what it pays on deposits and makes from interest payments — could increase by $1 billion this year. However, he said it was too soon to adjust the full year NII projection of $94.5 billion. Meanwhile, the bank estimated that its net charge-off rate, the share of credit card debt that will not be repaid, will come to between 3.6% and 3.9% for 2026, compared to the 3.6% net charge-off rate JPMorgan expects to see this year. Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking, said that while consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy and resilient, consumer confidence and small business sentiment have “definitely worsened.” More than half of businesses in goods-producing sectors anticipate negative impacts from tariffs, an increase from previous months, according to the May edition of PYMNTS Intelligence’s the 2025 Certainty Project, “Tariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play.” The report found that this sentiment is driven by expectations of supply chain disruptions, product delivery delays and rising raw materials costs and that the uncertainty is influencing business decisions.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday (May 19) that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin. Dimon announced this at the bank’s annual investor day, while reiterating his own skepticism about digital currency, CNBC reported Monday. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said, per the report. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” Dimon added that he remains concerned about issues around bitcoin, such as money laundering, lack of clarity in terms of ownership and use in illicit activities, according to the report. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said, per the report. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” It was reported in December 2023 that Dimon had been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies for some time and that he told a Senate Banking Committee hearing that if he had the power, he would shut down the entire industry. While he criticized cryptocurrencies, he had different views on blockchain technology, and JPMorgan actively embraced that technology for various projects, including the development of its proprietary stablecoin, JPM Coin. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) provided new guidance March 28 saying that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they adequately manage the associated risks. Previously, under guidance that the FDIC rescinded, the agency required prior notification of crypto-related activities. “With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said at the time in a press release. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.” Institutional adoption of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is seen as inevitable, although risk remains an obstacle, PYMNTS reported May 13. The new wave of adoption is being led by highly regulated institutions, which are grappling with the core question of risk across the blockchain.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. reportedly launched a $500 million leveraged loan and plans to sell $2.3 billion in high-yield bonds to support Flutter Entertainment’s purchase of Playtech’s Italian gambling business called Snaitech. Flutter Entertainment, owner of FanDuel, tapped a bridge facility for the deal, which closed in late April, Bloomberg reported Monday (May 19). The online sports betting and iGaming operator announced in a September press release that it planned to acquire Snaitech for cash consideration based on an enterprise value of 2.3 billion euros (about $2.6 billion). It added that the addition of Snaitech to its existing Italian business would give Flutter Entertainment a 30% online share in the Italian market. When announcing the completion of the acquisition in an April 30 press release, Flutter Entertainment said the move aligns with its strategy to invest in leadership positions in attractive international markets. “Snai’s significant omnichannel presence brings strategically important assets to enhance Flutter’s position in Italy,” Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson said in the release. “The transaction fits perfectly with our strategy for value creating M&A and is expected to bring about significant growth opportunities for Snai by providing access to Flutter’s market leading products and capabilities.” Flutter Entertainment announced in a Wednesday (May 14) press release that it completed the acquisition of an initial 56% stake in NSX Group, the Brazilian operator of the Betnacional brand, for cash consideration of $350 million. The company said this deal would enhance its competitive position in the “newly regulated and fast growing” Brazilian market. “The combination of NSX’s extensive local experience, alongside our existing Brazilian business and the advantages of the Flutter Edge, creates a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the exciting runway of future growth in Brazil,” Jackson said in the release. Gaming platforms exhibit a higher degree of data readiness compared to other consumer-facing platform businesses, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Carat from Fiserv collaboration, “Data-Driven Advantage: How Gaming Merchants Can Accelerate Growth.” The report found that 95% of analytics-led gaming platforms report revenue growth, significantly higher than other consumer-facing sectors, and that gaming platforms with dedicated analytics teams analyzing companywide data experienced a 9.6% average revenue increase between 2022 and 2023.

He sounded dour on the economy but hopeful on the potential for a regulatory reset.Jamie Dimon isn't a fan of bitcoin, but he plans to start offering it to clients of JPMorgan Chase nonetheless.\"We are going to allow you to buy it,\" Dimon said at the bank's annual presentation for investors on Monday. \"We're not going to custody it. We're going to put it in statements for clients.\"\"I don't think you should smoke. But I defend your right to smoke,\" he said in explaining his position. The bitcoin comments came as the JPMorgan CEO, often considered Wall Street's elder statesman, took the stage to answer questions from investors and research analysts. In the roughly 40-minute session, he touched on a range of topics, from the economy to what he expects from Trump's regulators. Dimon sounded a dour note on the economy, saying he thinks the risk of stagflation is \"two times\" higher than many think, and making dire predictions on credit as an investment class. \"I think the worst one for a bank and for most companies is stagflation,\" he continued, warning: \"I think the odds of that are probably two times what the market thinks.\"He also said the bank had lost some commercial opportunities as a result of Trump's trade war. \"We've lost business because of that,\" he said in response to an analyst's question.He sounded upbeat, however, when it came to the president's regulatory agenda. \"I think that the Secretary of Treasury, the president of the United States, the new head of the OCC, the new head of the CFPB, Michelle Bowman at Federal Reserve, and the SEC have all made it clear that they want to fix some of the things they think are broken,\" he said. \"I think they'll accomplish some of that. Some will take longer than others, but they all want to do it.\"He called on regulators to consider lightening regulations for publicly traded companies, which he said have been halved since the 1990s, from 8,000 to 4,000. \"We're driving companies out of the public marketplace because of expensive reporting, litigation, cookie-cutter approaches to boards, compensation, and litigation,\" he said. \"I would love to be a private company,\" he added.Dimon also raised questions about the rapid expansion of investments in credit, including through funds raised to make nonbank loans, or private credit. \"I don't like making forecasts,\" Dimon said, \"but I am not a buyer of credit today. I think credit today is a bad risk,\" he said, adding, \"I think that people who haven't been through major downturns are missing the point about what can happen in credit.\" As interest rates rise and economic conditions soften, the risk of credit defaults rises, sometimes leaving borrowers strapped for cash and lenders struggling to recoup capital.Earlier in the day, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's CEO of consumer and community banking, said the firm was \"closely monitoring the whole ecosystem\" of lending but not giving up in spite of warning signs. \"The environment is very challenging for home lending and auto,\" she said, adding, \"but we remain committed.\"Have a tip?

America’s biggest bank says businesses and consumers are resilient in the face of uncertainty. As such, JPMorgan Chase is projecting that it could earn more from interest payments this year, according to a Reuters report Monday (May 19) from the bank’s annual presentation to investors and analysts. Jeremy Barnum, the bank’s chief financial officer, told investors that JPMorgan’s net interest income — the difference between what it pays on deposits and makes from interest payments — could increase by $1 billion this year. However, he said it was too soon to adjust the full-year NII projection of $94.5 billion. “The evolving tariff environment, combined with the preexisting geopolitical tensions, adds significant uncertainty into the economic outlook,” Barnum said. “The combination of inflation and large fiscal deficits may constrain the available policy responses in ways that further increase the risk.” Meanwhile, the bank estimated that its net charge-off rate, the share of credit card debt that will not be repaid, will come to between 3.6% and 3.9% for 2026, compared to the 3.6% net charge-off rate JPMorgan expects to see this year. “We see both consumers and small businesses remaining financially healthy and resilient,” said Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking. “However, what has definitely worsened is consumer confidence and small business sentiment.” Her comments come on the heels of last week’s preliminary May reading on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan. “Consumer gloom is not quite at historic levels — but it’s awfully close,” PYMNTS wrote about those findings. “Households are worried about inflation, about their own pressured finances as incomes and purchasing power weakens. They’re worried about tariffs.” The university’s readings showed consumer sentiment at 50.2 down from 52.2 in April, and now is at the second lowest level recorded by the monthly study. That survey followed new PYMNTS Intelligence research on how consumers are readjusting their spending plans in the face of those pressures, brought on by tariffs and trade wars. “The volatile nature of the tariffs, levied in on-again, off-again fashion, makes that planning volatile too,” PYMNTS wrote. “Given the fact that imported goods account for 45% of shoppers’ purchases, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence calculation based on Bureau of Economic Analysis and census data, the impact of tariffs will be keenly felt.” Six out of 10 consumers surveyed for the study expect to see price increases, while half of that group worry about the onset of a recession. Under half of all consumers believe the tariffs will generate more jobs. The post JPMorgan Forecasts Rising Interest Income Despite Economic Uncertainty appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase is telling managers to \"resist headcount growth\" and boost efficiencies.CFO Jeremy Barnum told shareholders that AI will help the firm tamp down its hiring.Another exec promised staffing reductions of 10% in a unit that handles fraud and account support.JPMorgan Chase's hiring spree of the last five years may finally be winding down. The bank's CFO on Monday told investors that starting this year, less of its $95 billion in annual spending will go toward hiring as the bank seeks to do more with less, thanks in part to AI. \"At the margin, we're asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency,\" CFO Jeremy Barnum said at the company's annual presentation to investors in New York City. Barnum said the bank will continue to hire strategically, and pointed in his presentation to what he called \"high-certainty areas,\" including bankers, advisors, and branches. \"It should go without saying that we'll never compromise on safety and soundness and we'll continue to hire and invest in the high- certainty areas where there is a link between adding employees and growth revenue,\" Barnum said.JPMorgan plans to hire in \"high-certainty areas\"ScreenshotDespite economic headwinds brought on by tariff turmoil, Barnum told investors that America's biggest bank by assets is on track for 17% ROTCE (a measure of returns for shareholders) and annual spending of $95 billion.The comments echo remarks made by CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this year when he told workers at a town hall meeting that \"attrition is your friend\" and encouraged them to welcome job-stealing AI. JPMorgan's headcount has grown more than 23% in the last five years, reporting more than 317,000 employees at the end of 2024, up from 256,981 at the end of 2019.Following Barnum's presentation, Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking, took the stage and predicted a 10% reduction in headcount in operations, a division focused on things like fraud, statement and payment processing, and account services.Lake, who cited advancements in AI for the reduction, said 10% was conservative. \"I would take the over on this projection and bet that we will deliver more,\" she said. JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum speaks at the bank's 2025 Investor Day presentation in New York City on May 19.JPMorgan 2025 Investor DayArtificial intelligence efficienciesBarnum said that artificial intelligence would be key to cutting down redundancies. \"It's actually pretty amazing, and from what certain of my colleagues tell me who are actually trained professional computer scientists, it actually helps them quite a bit too with their efficiency,\" JPMorgan's Barnum said. \"It's not just the amateurs who are helped by these tools. It's amazing stuff and we have high hopes for the efficiency gain.\"Other firms like Goldman Sachs have also been making deep investments in their AI tech stacks.Improving efficiencies has been a key theme at the bank this year as Dimon seeks to convince workers that returning to their desks Monday through Friday will help clients, including by boosting productivity. On Monday, the bank showed investors slides along these lines. One slide showed how the bank boosted productivity in its home lending unit while growing headcount at a slower clip. JPMorgan's 2025 Investor Day presentation demonstrates how the home lending unit has been producing bigger gains with flatter hiring.JPMorgan Chase 2025 Investor DayThe comments come as Wall Street deals with an erratic market tied to President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade war pronouncements. While that's buoyed equities trading volumes, it's threatened bonus projections for others in the financial industry, and hurt investment bankers and those affected by the stalled dealmaking landscape.As of Monday, the bank's stock was trading at about $267 per share, up about 37% over the past year. Last year, the bank earned a record $58.5 billion in net income.This story is developing.

The bank's CFO on Monday told investors that starting this year, less of its $95 billion in annual spending will go toward hiring as the bank seeks to do more with less, thanks in part to AI. \"At the margin, we're asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency,\" CFO Jeremy Barnum said at the company's annual presentation to investors in New York City. Barnum said the bank will continue to hire strategically, and pointed in his presentation to what he called \"high-certainty areas,\" including bankers, advisors, and branches. \"It should go without saying that we'll never compromise on safety and soundness and we'll continue to hire and invest in the high- certainty areas where there is a link between adding employees and growth revenue,\" Barnum said.JPMorgan plans to hire in \"high-certainty areas\"ScreenshotDespite economic headwinds brought on by tariff turmoil, Barnum told investors that America's biggest bank by assets is on track for 17% ROTCE (a measure of returns for shareholders) and annual spending of $95 billion.The comments echo remarks made by CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this year when he told workers at a town hall meeting that \"attrition is your friend\" and encouraged them to welcome job-stealing AI. JPMorgan's headcount has grown more than 23% in the last five years, reporting more than 317,000 employees at the end of 2024, up from 256,981 at the end of 2019.Following Barnum's presentation, Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking, took the stage and predicted a 10% reduction in headcount in operations, a division focused on things like fraud, statement and payment processing, and account services.Lake, who cited advancements in AI for the reduction, said 10% was conservative. \"I would take the over on this projection and bet that we will deliver more,\" she said. JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum speaks at the bank's 2025 Investor Day presentation in New York City on May 19.JPMorgan 2025 Investor DayArtificial intelligence efficienciesBarnum said that artificial intelligence would be key to cutting down redundancies. \"It's actually pretty amazing, and from what certain of my colleagues tell me who are actually trained professional computer scientists, it actually helps them quite a bit too with their efficiency,\" JPMorgan's Barnum said. \"It's not just the amateurs who are helped by these tools. It's amazing stuff and we have high hopes for the efficiency gain.\"Other firms like Goldman Sachs have also been making deep investments in their AI tech stacks.Improving efficiencies has been a key theme at the bank this year as Dimon seeks to convince workers that returning to their desks Monday through Friday will help clients, including by boosting productivity. On Monday, the bank showed investors slides along these lines. One slide showed how the bank boosted productivity in its home lending unit while growing headcount at a slower clip.

And you can't learn working from your basement.\"He has added the caveat that WFH can be effective in certain areas, such as virtual call centers. Still, it does reflect how skeptical he is of a coveted work perk — for some, a requirement — that many employees seek in their jobs.JPMorgan issued a five-day return-to-work mandate for most of its employees in January, and Dimon said in the Bloomberg TV interview that 10% of JPMorgan is remote.In his annual shareholder letter last year, Dimon said JPM has seen significant growth in the past half-decade while also allowing some \"bad habits to develop.\"\"Working from home exacerbated the situation by hindering innovation, slowing decision-making, inhibiting information sharing, reducing efficiency, and creating more politics and bureaucracy,\" he wrote.A spokesperson for JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.Here's what else Dimon has said about working from home.WFH stifles innovationDimon has said that remote work doesn't allow for a free flow of exchange of ideas that in-person work can, and that it ultimately slows down innovation at a company.\"Remote work eliminates much spontaneous learning and creativity because you don't run into people at the coffee machine, talk with clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet with customers and employees for feedback on your products and services,\" he wrote in an annual shareholder letter in 2021, explaining the \"serious weaknesses\" of working in the \"virtual world.\"Remote work is bad for young professionalsRemote work is especially bad for up-and-coming professionals, according to the banking CEO.In an interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in late February, Dimon said WFH doesn't work in his business and that \"younger people are being left behind\" because of it.

        "description": "Retail investors who bought the dip during the tariff chaos are growing fatigued, JPMorgan data shows. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesBullish retail traders are showing signs of fatigued, JPMorgan said.Dip-buying retail investors piled into stocks during April's tariff-fueled chaos. JPMorgan said that waning retail participation could hurt the recovery rally since April lows. The rally in stocks since tariffs shook the market could soon lose steam as a key group of buyers shows signs of slowing down, JPMorgan said this week. Retail investors have been resilient buyers of stocks during the latest bout of volatility prompted by tariffs, but the trend is waning. Coupled with the fact that institutional funds have already rebuilt their positions after fleeing the market in April, there might not be much fuel for the S&P 500 to keep its rally going.\"A slowing of the retail impulse, more elevated equity exposures by equity-focused hedge funds, largely completed short covering by macro hedge funds, and continued lack of buying by foreign investors, all together imply more limited upside for US equities going forward,\" the bank wrote.The benchmark S&P 500 has jumped 18% from its mid-April low, when it briefly dipped into bear market territory after Donald Trump revealed sweeping tariffs on imported goods. Despite the intense volatility, retail investors emerged as a bulwark against deeper losses, buying the dip in stocks at historic volumes during the month.JPMorgan\"After two strong months the retail impulse appears to have slowed in May, perhaps implying some fatigue among retail investors after a protracted period of net purchases since mid-2023,\" the bank wrote. Analysts are trying to gauge how far the rally can go. That's highly dependent on how US trade negotiations pan out, and whether the economy can avoid a recession.For retail investors, JPMorgan suggests that another equity dip is necessary for the bullish impulse to return among the cohort.

        "description": "JPMorgan economists this week said the risk of a recession had fallen below 50%. Trade war volatility has eased, but Dimon said risks remain. JPMorgan boss Jamie DimonNoam Galai/Getty ImagesJamie Dimon still thinks a US recession is possible even after tariff tensions were dialed down.He pointed to uncertainty surrounding tariffs, the US budget deficit, and geopolitical conflict.Dimon also said that the muddled outlook has been holding back investment. Jamie Dimon isn't ruling out a recession even after forecasts for a downturn have been pared back following a US-China deal to lower tariffs.The JPMorgan CEO said he believes a downturn is still possible, despite market volatility easing and renewed optimism over recent progress toward a trade deal between the US and China. \"I'm going to defer to economists who give it about a 50% chance,\" Dimon said of the chances of a recession. \"If there's a recession, I don't know how big it'll big or how long it'll last. Hopefully we'll avoid it, but I wouldn't take it off the table at this point.\"His hesitation to dismiss the possibility of a recession is due to lingering uncertainties weighing on markets and the economy. He pointed to issues like geopolitical conflict, America's growing debt load, rising interest rates, and tariffs.He told Bloomberg at JPMorgan's annual Global Markets Conference in Paris on Thursday that those factors have the potential to stoke inflation and slow the economy.In a note earlier this week, analysts at JPMorgan said the risk of a US recession had fallen below 50%, but the risk is still elevated. Analysts lowered their recession forecast from 60% after the US-China trade deal framework was announced.But uncertainties around issues like the deficit and geopolitics still remain, Dimon said. He noted that, while the administration has dialed back some of its tariffs, many of those reductions — including the reduced tariffs on China — are tied to a 90-day timeline while negotiations continue. \"I don't expect immediate resolution, you know, to the satisfaction of everybody, in 90 days,\" he said. He added that even lower tariffs are making investment decisions more difficult. \"Even at this level, you see people holding back on investment and thinking through what they want to do.\"In the meantime, Dimon expects tariffs to continue to rattle markets. \"I would expect continued volatility. I think it's a mistake to think we can go through all the things we're going through and the volatility itself will come down,\" he added.News of the US-China trade deal has elicited mixed reactions from Wall Street, with some forecasters cautiously raising their price targets for stocks, while others have remained focused on the risks stemming from tariffs. A handful of banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, have lowered their predicted odds of a recession over the next 12 months.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Although stocks have rallied and regained losses since April 2, some — including Federal Reserve board governor Adriana Kugler — have said the economy is not out of the woods yet.JPMorgan also raised its projection for US economic growth this year to 0.6%, up from 0.2% before the China tariff pause. Feroli also predicts that the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key measure of inflation, will rise to 3.5% rather than 4%, but still higher than 2.2% at the start of the year.Feroli's note also addressed a mild risk in the job market as businesses hold off on new hirings and investments due to economic uncertainties brought on by tariffs. A long list of major companies, including Morgan Stanley, Wayfair, UPS, and Meta, have been laying off staff this year.\"We still project a modest contraction in employment later this year, as labor demand is projected to slow even more than labor supply,\" wrote Feroli. \"Our updated labor market outlook is less demanding of immediate action to stem employment risks; for the Fed, we are pushing back the timing of the resumption of rate cuts from September to December.\"Read the original article on Business Insider JPMorgan says recession risks remain \"elevated.\"Dado Ruvic/REUTERSJPMorgan revised its recession forecast after President Donald Trump's tariff truce with China.Trump and China agreed to lift most tariffs on each other for 90 days for further negotiations.A JPMorgan analyst said that the chances of a US recession are now below 50%, but risks remain.JPMorgan is revising its 2025 recession prediction after President Donald Trump reached a temporary tariff truce with China.In a Tuesday note, the bank said the chances of a US recession this year had fallen below 50%, down from a previous estimate of 60% after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2.\"The administration's recent dialing down of some of the more draconian tariffs placed on China should reduce the risk that the US economy slips into recession this year,\" wrote JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"We believe recession risks are still elevated, but now below 50%.\"JPMorgan found that the tariff change meant the average effective tariff rate had reduced from 24% to 14%, representing a tax cut of almost $300 billion.\"Most of that prior tax was likely to have been borne by US consumers in the form of higher prices,\" Feroli said. \"The rolling back of this tax should provide some relief to consumer spending, and in our modeling is enough to tip the second-half growth outlook from one of modest contraction to one of modest growth.\"He added that the lower tariffs are still a boost to inflation, however, which will affect disposable income and in turn, consumer spending.The shift follows Trump's announcement of a 90-day tariff pause that scales back duties on US imports from China from up to 245% to 30% as negotiations continue.

        "description": "Goldman Sachs' Melissa GoldmanGoldman Sachs; Alyssa Powell/BIMelissa Goldman is the global head of engineering for global banking and markets at Goldman Sachs.She previously worked at Google and JPMorgan Chase.She discussed why she's back at Goldman Sachs after 10 years and the evolving role of engineers.As Wall Street has poured money into technology budgets and become major players in patents and research, it's also become a destination for technologists to work — rivaling even Silicon Valley.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Melissa Goldman, a partner and tech leader at Goldman Sachs. She started her career 30 years ago at Goldman Sachs as an analyst and worked her way to managing director before departing for the rival firm JPMorgan Chase, where she helped lead the corporate tech division as a chief information officer.Goldman joined Google in 2022 as a vice president and global head of corporate engineering, creating and deploying technologies that power Google's internal systems. Last fall, Goldman returned to Goldman Sachs, where she runs the engineering teams powering the bank's investment banking and sales and trading units. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with New York City-based Goldman. It's been edited for length and clarity.I was a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University back in the early 1990s. The experience of being a computer science student at a very technical university meant you spent most of your time in the basement of the engineering building doing your programming.I knew that the way I wanted to use my technology skills was really to apply them to real-world problems, where your technology would make a material difference toward a product or a business, where you could actually see the impact of your work in almost a real-time basis.When I ended up in financial services, I couldn't have been more pleased. The volumes, speed, and characteristics of what drives the business are tied to actually being able to build and engineer systems and solutions that enable all of that to happen.One of my responsibilities during my first stint at Goldman Sachs was the collateral management system, which helped manage some of the contractual relationships with our counterparts. I was helping the firm manage risk and relationships with our clients. It was my responsibility to architect and build out a system that was nimble and could manage the complexities of these relationships and calculate money moving between counterparts. That responsibility became even more pronounced during times of volatility, and I was able to see firsthand how my work was pivotal in important times for the firm.Some projects involved enabling a new financial product that we could offer to our clients or operating our businesses in additional countries around the world. Often, the work provides new and innovative ways to leverage our data to create greater insights and transparency into various decision-making processes.But I left finance for Google out of curiosity.As an engineer, I was interested in having the opportunity to work in tech and be involved in the building of products. I had built a lot of expertise through my work in finance that was very applicable to the tech industry, but at the same time, I thought I could learn something new through the lens of a technology company.The work I was focused on impacted the entire employee base of Google. We built and implemented the systems used by Googlers around the world, making sure people had what was needed to get their jobs done and the company had the systems in place to run it. So my work had a direct impact on the employees of Google and an indirect impact on the customers of Google.But I missed this sense of purpose toward very tangible business results —the volatility, the constant need to be nimble, responsive, and reactive.Arguably, I couldn't put that same kind of art and finesse to work at Google in the way that I have the opportunity to within financial services.The reality is — and I remind folks of this when they try to make the comparison — that tech and finance have a different set of products and a different environment. Financial services is an industry where tech is a differentiator to the success of the business; at a company like Google, tech is the business.How to handle the rate of changeI'm thrilled to be here. But it's hard.The pace and rate of change are exceptional. How technology is evolving, the opportunities to bring AI and automation and different kinds of efficiency elements to what we do and how we do it (every couple of weeks there's something new and different), how we challenge ourselves to be at the forefront of these things — it's exhausting, right?It's an amazing time to be an engineer, but it's a lot of responsibility to do it well and stay nimble enough to respond and react to the changes that are out there.There is no question AI will be a material part of our journey for the next decades, and for someone like me, it will involve being on the front lines of maximizing the technology to help our people better serve our clients.Already, we are seeing a roughly 20% increase in efficiency depending on the developer and the use case. One of the most impactful ways we can use it is to take the toil out of the tasks that we would rather not have our best and brightest minds working on and instead have them work on designing new products. We're going to ask some individuals on our teams to do different things, but it's more about evolving their role than a flat-out completely different way of operating.I believe engineers will maintain their creative role in designing systems and architectures. As technology evolves, they will still act as the conductor in an orchestra of additional instruments.I think we're only scratching the surface of what opportunities we'll be able to realize through it.Want to share your career path with us?

        "description": "JHVEPhoto/ShutterstockEmployees of JPMorgan's largest US office are back 5 days a week as of last week.The Polaris site in Columbus, Ohio, is a major tech hub with more than 12,000 workers.Employees spoke to BI about jockeying for desks and parking in their first week back.JPMorgan Chase's largest US office was put to the test last week as its roughly 12,000 workers returned Monday through Friday for the first time since the work-from-home craze swept the nation five years ago.Whether the bank passed that test depends on whom you ask.On Monday, April 21, an executive at the firm's sprawling Columbus, Ohio, campus, projected optimism about the site's first full week back in the office, while acknowledging some pain points.\"Ample seats were available across the site,\" said the memo by Becky Griffin, the location leader at the Columbus site. \"We did notice that some areas were busier than others,\" she added, \"and we're continuing to monitor capacity to make sure everyone can easily find a seat.\"Griffin said lines for the cafeteria at the campus, known as Polaris, were \"longer than usual,\" but said they \"moved efficiently, with a smooth checkout process.\"She also addressed concerns about parking. \"To make the parking process more efficient, we have already adjusted the shuttle service and provided updated instructions to our on-site parking attendees,\" she wrote in the memo, which workers received as they were wrapping up their first full day in the office together.Employees who spoke to BI complained that some of these issues persisted as the week went on, leaving some workers jockeying for desks, hunting for alternative parking, and skipping lunch to avoid long lines. In a second memo sent on Friday, Griffin said the company would be \"making ongoing adjustments\" and offered a link to an email for employees to provide feedback. She added that the bank had established a \"Polaris Commuting Resources\" page on its internal system to keep employees up-to-date on changes. JPMorgan workers at Polaris who spoke to BI, however, said they couldn't see easy solutions to some of the problems discussed in the memo because the campus — which houses some 12,000-plus employees — has limited parking and a total seating capacity of 11,930, according to internal documents about the property reviewed by BI.\"There's really not a lot of space left on the property,\" said one software engineer at Polaris. \"They'd have to make some serious changes for the site to be able to hold all the cars that come there every day.\"The engineer was one of three employees who spoke to BI working at the Columbus facility, which is home to many of the bank's tech workers and key to several of its cloud-focused initiatives. These employees declined to be named because they were not authorized to discuss company matters, but their identities are known to BI.\"There's not really infrastructure in place to handle the number of people that are working there now,\" the software engineer continued, adding: \"It's definitely put everybody in kind of a tough spot.\"Griffin did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to BI, Michael Fusco, a JPMorgan spokesperson, pointed to measures the bank has taken over the past week to smooth out the transition.\"We have been working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees need to return full-time,\" Fusco said. \"Last week, we had more than 2,000 open seats available daily in Polaris, ensuring ample seating to accommodate all employees. We also increased the number of parking attendants and shuttles to improve the parking process.\"Life at Polaris in a post-RTO worldIn January, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called his workers back to the office five days a week starting in March. The return was delayed for some office locations to give them time to get ready. The firm's Polaris campus only switched to the five-day-a-week RTO model last week, on April 21.JPMorgan isn't alone in demanding workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Employees at Goldman Sachs and Citadel were called back to the office five days a week in 2021. Tech giants like Amazon and TikTok have also ordered workers back to their desks Monday through Friday.Some Polaris employees have pushed back, however, including by exploring unionizing, as BI has previously reported. Dimon defended his decision in an internal town hall at the Columbus campus in February, saying the mandate was issued with the bank and its clients in mind — not individual preferences.JPMorgan has addressed the insufficient parking at Polaris by reserving additional spaces at a local church about a mile away. Once parked, workers can wait for a shuttle that can take them to and from the campus, about a 10-minute ride. Employees, however, described 30-minute waits to board the buses, in some cases.According to one manager of a back-office group, on-campus parking has also become strained. The employee said the site's central buildings are encircled by a road dotted with 2-story parking garages, adding that the road has become logjammed.\"From the moment you hit that ring, you're sitting in traffic to get around the campus,\" said the manager, who recently spent an hour and fifteen minutes looking for a parking spot.It's led some employees to search for workarounds — like finding parking at Polaris Fashion Place, a nearby mall, and ordering Uber transportation to the office, the second of the two engineers said.This strategy hasn't proved a major time saver, however, this engineer added, citing the backlog of vehicles clogging the campus road in the morning. The back-office manager described large orange construction signs punctuating the road to direct traffic, as well as third-party traffic attendants to channel the flow of cars.He questioned whether these measures were helpful, however, saying the third-party traffic attendants, in his experience, \"just wave you past closed lots. They don't tell you where to go.\"'They can cheat the system'Once inside, there's some jockeying for desks, albeit mainly for people who don't have assigned seating and don't reserve a spot ahead of time through the company's booking portal.\"I actually have a close friend who had to move desks probably five times over the span of an hour,\" said the first software engineer.It's not just individuals who are being Tetris'd around the office in an effort to have teams sit together. The back-office manager said their team's designated seating was moved earlier in April, and that they'll need to be relocated again in the coming days.\"Everyone is still fed up, and everyone is still scratching their heads as to why we're doing this,\" the back-office manager said.Both software engineers said some intrepid workers had discovered they could swipe into the office and then leave a few hours later if they wanted to go home early.\"They can cheat the system like that,\" said the first engineer. \"Some people will just badge in, work for an hour or two, and leave.\"Employees also questioned whether being back in the office is really fostering teamwork if it means some colleagues can't sit together.\"One of our guys\" — an executive director on a particular team — \"is sitting in a completely different wing, because we have no room left,\" the second engineer said. \"Tell me how collaboration is a driving force when your teams are now scattered throughout the building instead of sitting in one area.\"Have a tip?

        "description": "The benchmark index won't reclaim its February all-time high in the next 12 months. Investors surveyed also see further dollar weakness ahead. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty ImagesInvestors surveyed by JPMorgan expect the S&P 500 to remain under 6,000 for the next 12 months.Most respondents expect the US economy to enter a period of stagflation.A large cohort remains committed to buying shares of the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks.The S&P 500 has already peaked this year and won't reclaim its 2025 high in the next 12 months, according to investors surveyed by JPMorgan.\"An overwhelming 93% see the S&P 500 at 6,000 or below over the next 12 months, with 40% expecting the S&P 500 to stay in the current range of 5,000 to 5,500,\" the bank wrote on Friday, summarizing an April survey of 495 investors.The group agreed that it's highly unlikely for the benchmark index to reach its February record of 6,144. Close to a third expect it to fall below the 5,000 mark this year.The results are a far cry from the bullish projections that preceded Donald Trump's presidential victory in the fall. Some saw the S&P climbing as high as 6,500 in 2025, and that path looked plausible until tariffs dashed hopes for another year of stellar gains. The bull run petered out as Trump's protectionist trade policies slowed market momentum and raised recession fears. After the White House announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs on April 2, the S&P 500 briefly plunged into bear market territory. JPMorgan respondents agree that trade wars and tariff uncertainties will trigger economic consequences, with 20% of survey respondens bracing for a hard landing recession. A broader 61% anticipate stagflation to hit the US economy in the next 12 months.That scenario, in which inflation keeps rising amid slowing economic growth, is supported by expectations of 3% US core PCE inflation by the end of this year.Investors also forecast more dollar weakness in 2025, expanding a trend sparked by Trump's tariffs. The greenback's decline is considered a signal that investors are losing faith in US assets, helping explain a recent sell-off in US Treasurys. Despite market pessimism sweeping across the survey, stock market respondents haven't given up bullish hopes for the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks. \"Despite the lack of conviction on the outlook for the S&P 500, 41% still view the Mag-7/GenAI theme as a multi-year investment opportunity, preferring to buy on dips, and another 9% prefer to ignore the noise and will continue to increase their allocation,\" the note said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images; Social Security Administration; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIThe Social Security Administration faces a delicate moment. Its future teeters between a career bureaucrat and a former Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase executive who may bring order — or further tumult.The agency maintains the country's largest safety net. It employs nearly 60,000 federal workers and provides benefits to over 73 million Americans. It has long been seen as untouchable in Washington — \"the third rail of American politics\" — and commissioners rarely leave, even as presidential administrations change.That changed in February, when Michelle King, a 30-year veteran of the agency, abruptly left her role as acting commissioner. In her place, President Donald Trump installed Leland Dudek, an employee who wasn't in the agency's executive ranks.The transition, which came as DOGE staffers accessed internal agency data, one worker's affidavit said, was a sharp departure from typical agency protocol. It \"was a shock to every single person that works at SSA,\" Laura Haltzel, a former Social Security associate commissioner, told Business Insider. It was also a harbinger of the chaos to come.Since then, the White House DOGE office has slashed staff numbers, policy flip-flops have put beneficiaries on edge, Dudek weighed closing the agency based on his understanding of a judge's ruling, and the AARP has said that things may get worse.Meanwhile, Frank Bisignano, a finance titan and formidable turnaround manager, is waiting in the wings as Trump's nominee to replace Dudek. The transition ahead could set the course for how — and how well — millions of Americans receive their benefits.The turnaround agentBisignano, 65, is the chair and CEO of Fiserv, a global fintech giant. He was the second-highest-paid CEO in the US in 2017, when he earned more than $100 million.Some in the industry told BI they see him as a turnaround artist, which could serve him well should he take over the agency.Bisignano's confirmation is awaiting a full Senate vote, which is expected after the chamber votes on nominees for multiple diplomatic positions. He has already appeared before the Senate Finance Committee, where he addressed concerns about privatization. \"I've never thought about privatizing. It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about,\" he told lawmakers.An official on the transition team shepherding Trump's nominees through the confirmation process declined to comment for this story or make Bisignano available for an interview.Some who spoke with BI expressed surprise that he would join the Trump administration. An archived biography from First Data, where he served as chair and CEO, said he's \"a strong supporter of diversity\" and helped create affinity groups for women and LGBTQ+ employees at the company. He's donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, records show. In May 2019, Bisignano gave $125,000 to the Trump Victory PAC and another $83,900 to the Republican National Committee.Frank Bisignano during his confirmation hearing.The Washington Post/Getty ImagesBorn in Brooklyn, with a father who was an orphan and a grandfather who emigrated from Italy, Bisignano first landed on Wall Street in the 1970s. He started out at smaller firms before joining the legendary bankers Sandy Weill and Jamie Dimon as they built what would become Citigroup. There, he managed the company's global transaction services business, helping steer trillions of dollars in payments worldwide.\"He knew enough about the guts of the operations he was involved in to be able to be a very good manager,\" Weill, a former chair and CEO of Citigroup, told BI.Later, he joined JPMorgan Chase, where he reversed multibillion-dollar losses in the firm's mortgage banking unit and rose to become its co-chief operating officer.\"Frank did a very good job in operations for JPMorgan, but I think that he was looking for something where he would be able to test his leadership skills beyond operations,\" Weill said.In 2013, he took over First Data. Its owner at the time, the private equity giant KKR, was seeking a CEO with knowledge of payments and back-office systems. He steered the company through its $2.6 billion initial public offering and its $22 billion sale to Fiserv in 2019; he became Fiserv's CEO the following year. Under his tenure, the company's stock price has roughly doubled.A post on the official White House website in late April touted the \"Trump effect,\" crediting the president for spurring a series of private sector investments in American industry. Among those the administration pointed to: Fiserv's $175 million commitment to develop a 427,000-square-foot fintech campus in Kansas, which is expected to drive the creation of 2,000 jobs.Leland Dudek's turbulent tenureCurrently leading the agency — and seen by some SSA insiders as responsible for much of the recent turmoil — is Dudek, the acting commissioner Trump installed in February.One former senior Social Security official who was familiar with the senior-level employees usually tapped for the role remembered thinking: \"Who is this guy?\" A director-level employee who's on administrative leave told BI that Dudek, 48, was \"a nobody until a month ago.\" (Most of the SSA sources who spoke with BI left within the past few months.)Most recently, Dudek had been serving as a senior advisor in the agency's Office of Program Integrity.Dudek, who holds degrees from the Catholic University of America and the National Defense University, has long been enmeshed in anti-fraud and information technology work. According to an agency biography, he previously served as the chief information security officer for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. He has been with the SSA since 2009, though he does not appear on an organizational chart archived immediately before King's departure.One former manager at SSA who met Dudek when he arrived at the agency said that he \"seemed like a pretty earnest, straightforward kind of computer science IT type who had experience outside the agency.\" Dudek, this person said, was part of a larger group who felt the agency was slow to adopt technological advances.\"He generally seemed to be interested in things running more effectively,\" a former SSA employee said. They described him as being frustrated over \"trying to make change and do things in a bureaucratic environment\" and said other employees at his level felt similarly.Another former SSA executive said they believed he had good intentions and genuinely cared about curbing fraud and improper payments.His path at the agency was not straightforward. Elon Musk said on X that Dudek was \"fired\" for \"helping @DOGE find taxpayer savings\" before he ascended to SSA's highest perch.There, he brought his own style.\"I think he felt like he deserved a voice at the table, and then he suddenly got one and didn't quite know what to do with it,\" the former executive said. The executive added that Dudek appeared to have competing priorities between staff cuts and making sure the agency ran smoothly. \"It's been a bit of a yo-yo,\" they said.\"It's very unusual, very unusual leadership,\" said Kathleen Romig, who worked at the agency for nine years on and off and now serves as the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Many of his decisions seemed to be \"hasty and ill-considered,\" Romig said. Some, like shuttering the agency or changing in-person identification guidelines, were ultimately reversed.\"I've never seen leadership like this before at SSA, by a long shot,\" she said.On a press call in March, Dudek said some contracts in Maine that let parents register their newborn children for an SSA number were \"canceled because I screwed up.\"\"I made the wrong move there. I should always ask my staff for guidance first before I cancel something,\" Dudek said. \"I'm new at this job. It looked fishy.\" The contracts were ultimately reinstated.Dudek and the Social Security Administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The Trump Administration is targeting the Social Security Administration for suspected fraud.VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty ImagesHis appointment pushed at least one SSA worker to leave. When they saw reports that he'd shared information with DOGE and was still elevated, \"it just all became a farce,\" the former worker said.A person who has spoken with Dudek said they believed some of his bluster might be a smoke screen. They said Dudek, like previous commissioners, said he feared that the system was on the brink of collapse and worried about people not receiving their benefits — a similar sentiment to what Dudek expressed in a recording obtained by ProPublica. They feel that he thinks he's doing damage control and running interference between DOGE and everyone else.\"It felt like a bunch of 6-year-olds with too much sugar had been put in charge of the agency and were just kind of running all over the place, randomly disconnecting and reconnecting things in different ways,\" the former SSA manager said.Bisignano's high-stakes challengeThis is what awaits Bisignano, who has developed a reputation as a hard-charging, demanding executive who tends to see Saturdays as just another workday.\"He was always making sure that everybody had their nose to the grindstone,\" Weill said.As he's moved from company to company, Bisignano has surrounded himself with a cadre of deputies, some of whom have been with him since his JPMorgan Chase days. Another person who knows Bisignano said some of these loyalists had shown they'd follow his lead without question, no matter how big the ask.\"They're going to pick up any call from Frank any time of day — morning, night, Saturday, Sunday, 7 a.m.,\" the person said.Some of the decisions at Fiserv that played out on Bisignano's watch appear to have ra",

Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Uber, CrowdStrike and JPMorgan Chase are among the thousands that have voiced their views on how the U.S. should regulate artificial intelligence (AI) for growth and innovation. The federal government released all of the comments Thursday (April 24) in a searchable database. OpenAI was one of the earlier submissions, calling for stronger export controls to China but less onerous ones for democratic countries, among other recommendations. Google irked entertainment industry creators and other workers by calling for fair use of copyrighted content — echoed by OpenAI — along with recommendations for government AI adoption. Overall, the submissions show several similarities — the need for infrastructure investment, open innovation and regulatory consistency to unify the patchwork of state laws — though they differ on approach. Read more: OpenAI Calls for Federal Government to Preempt State AI Laws Here’s a roundup of what tech giants, AI startups and other companies want from the Trump administration: Amazon Amazon is pushing for energy infrastructure investments, cloud and chip access, workforce development, federal AI adoption and setting interoperable international standards. Streamline energy regulations: Amazon said AI will require a lot of electricity to power. It advocates for streamlining nuclear power projects and transmission upgrades to keep the U.S. competitive. Lead global talks in AI: Amazon urges the White House to lead in AI efforts globally by promoting global regulatory interoperability through international standards for AI adoption. Educate the workforce in AI: Americans need to be educated on practical AI implementation not just advanced technical training, Amazon says, and the U.S. must invest in more advanced AI researchers and engineers while also enabling workers to use AI tools at work. Transform government agencies using AI: Amazon says federal agencies should leverage AI and the cloud to move away from legacy, on-premises data centers to transform their operations. Anthropic Anthropic projects that as early as late 2026, frontier AI systems may rival Nobel laureates in reasoning ability — and must be treated as national assets. Here are three key items on its wish list: AI threat testing: Anthropic is calling for building robust federal infrastructure for testing powerful models for risks in cybersecurity and development of biological weapons, among others. Strengthen chip export controls: The company supports new restrictions on advanced chips — including the currently exempt Nvidia H20 — and agreements with other countries to prevent smuggling. Energy for AI: Echoing Amazon, Anthropic projects that 50 gigawatts of additional power will be needed by 2027 just for U.S. AI developers. Monitor economic impacts of AI: The U.S. government should enhance its data collection mechanisms to better capture the economic fallout from wider AI adoption, as well as prepare for “significant” changes. Meta Meta’s Llama models are at the heart of its vision for open-source AI leadership and its recommendations to the U.S. government reflect this priority. Don’t stifle open source: Meta calls on the U.S. to resist pressure to regulate or restrict open AI models, warning that doing so would empower authoritarian regimes to fill the vacuum. Federal agency adoption: Meta urges the U.S. government to use open models wherever possible, arguing they are more secure, customizable and better for national security use cases. Fair use clarity: It wants an executive order clarifying that training AI on public data is fair use, which is crucial against copyright lawsuits. This reflects the stances of OpenAI and Google. State rules harm innovation: Meta is warning that fragmented state-level rules will raise compliance costs and stifle innovation. Microsoft Microsoft said the U.S. must stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence, noting that it is investing more than $50 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure in 2025. Enhance computational and energy resources: AI needs a lot of power and the software giant called for modernizing the electric grid, permitting data center construction and enhancing U.S. manufacturing of critical grid components and AI hardware. Access to high-quality data: The company wants to unlock government and other publicly funded data for AI training. Promote trust, safety and national security with AI: Microsoft supports laws targeting deepfake fraud, harnessing AI in defense, and to advance cybersecurity protection. Upskill the U.S. workforce: The company says government should lead national efforts to educate about AI and prepare them for future jobs that will be driven by an AI economy. Mistral AI France-based Mistral, with operations in Palo Alto, Calif., positioned itself as the startup champion for open-source innovation. Support open source: Like Meta, Mistral makes the case that transparency and public access to model weights improve research, security, and democratization of AI development. Weaken monopolies: Mistral advocates for antitrust enforcement, such as those brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to ensure startups and small- to medium-size businesses (SMBs) can compete against incumbents. Enhance global chip trade: Mistral said overregulating chips or AI exports could inadvertently shift innovation to other countries. Global AI cooperation: The firm wants the U.S. to strike a balance — protecting national security while encouraging multinational innovation partnerships that can be mutually beneficial. Uber The ride-hailing company said in its remarks that AI plays an increasingly important role in shaping mobility services. Uber has invested in robust AI governance to ensure accountability in decisions driven by AI. Avoid overregulating low-risk AI: Many mobility-related AI applications pose minimal risk and should not be burdened with complex new rules, Uber says. Stop patchwork of state rules: Uber urges federal preemption to eliminate the growing patchwork of inconsistent state AI laws. Use existing laws first: Current regulations on privacy, discrimination and consumer protection already address most AI-related risks, Uber says. Adopt a risk-based framework: The company says regulations should focus on high-risk use cases and boost innovation in less risky ones such as pricing. CrowdStrike CrowdStrike’s comments center on using and securing AI in the cybersecurity domain. Last year, the cybersecurity company botched an update that cause a global outage of Windows computers and servers. Focus on AI for cybersecurity: CrowdStrike says that the use of AI to detect cyber threats gives the U.S. an “enormous” advantage because it can defeat new threats based on behavior rather than known signatures. Regulation should not stifle innovation: New regulations on AI should not harm innovation and development of new technologies, the company says. Protect the models: The company calls for robust protections around the AI systems themselves and training data for resilience. JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan, which runs more than 500 AI and machine learning systems, calls for greater AI governance. Use existing frameworks: The bank argued that current banking regulations — such as model and third-party risk management, data governance, and privacy — are already well-suited to handle AI. Sector-specific regulation: JPMorgan supports a sector-by-sector approach, where existing financial regulators, such as the OCC or Federal Reserve, lead AI oversight for banks. Level the playing field: The bank wants non-banks offering financial services to be subject to the same standards, especially for AI in credit underwriting and fraud detection. Unify federal and state regulation: JPMorgan echoes the concerns of others about a patchwork of state laws, and calls for the federal government to preempt state laws.

        "description": "Analysts at JPMorgan said it expects Nintendo to sell 18 million Switch 2 consoles on an annual basis. Nintendo Switch 2 will be playable as a handheld and on your TV.NintendoNintendo stock hit fresh records in trading in Tokyo a day after its US-listed ADRs notched an all-time high. The rally comes after pre-orders for Nintendo's Switch 2 console sold out in the US.The 7% stock price surge catapulted Nintendo's market value to $92 billion.The move: Nintendo's ADR shares surged as much as 7% to $19.82 on Thursday, a record high. The gains continued on Friday, with Japan-listed Nintendo shares popping another 4% higher.Why: The surge, which catapulted the company's market value to $92 billion, was sparked by the company's Switch 2 pre-order window opening up in the US.And those pre-orders sold out fast.As of Thursday afternoon, pre-orders were sold out across retailers, including Best Buy, Target, GameStop, and Walmart.The console's pre-order date was postponed due to the Trump tariffs, as Nintendo sought to better understand their potential impact on its business.While Nintendo didn't increase the price of its Switch 2 following the Trump tariffs, it did increase the price of Switch 2 accessories.What it means: The swift pre-order sellouts indicate massive pent-up demand for the Switch 2 console. The original Switch console was released just over 8 years ago.While the strong demand may not be too surprising given that the original Switch console was released eight years ago, it is impressive considering the console retails for $450, with most bundles being offered for about $500.The high price tag and solid sales suggest that even amid concerns of rising inflation and a potential recession, consumers are willing to spend money on indulgences they want.Analysts at JPMorgan expect the strong sales to continue.\"We think Switch 2's annual sales volume is likely to be 18 million units, putting it below 20 million units but expect steady build-up over the long term,\" JPMorgan's Junko Yamamura said in a note on Thursday.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Foreign investors have continued to buy into US stock ETFs since the market peaked in February, bucking the narrative of a \"sell America\" investing trend. Foreign investors have continued to snap up US equities, while bond selling was \"modest\" in April, JPMorgan says.AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams\"Sell America\" was blamed for the volatility in the last few weeks as Trump's policies ramped up uncertainty. But foreign investors aren't ditching US assets in droves, JPMorgan said.Instead, the bank sees hedge fund selling as a primary driver of the downward pressure on stocks. The \"sell America\" narrative that's been blamed for big gyrations in US assets in recent weeks might be overblown, JPMorgan said. Speculation has run hot that foreign investors have been ditching US stocks, bonds, and the dollar amid swelling policy uncertainty. The premise seemed especially strong at the start of April, when President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs tarnished confidence in equities but also safe-haven trades like Treasury bonds.However, recent data doesn't entirely support the thesis, JPMorgan said on Thursday. \"There is little evidence thus far of significant selling of US equities or bonds by foreign investors,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a Wednesday note.While the S&P 500 has corrected sharply since its February 19 record high, its 20% peak-to-trough decline can't be entirely justified by foreign outflows. In fact, a glance at US stock ETFs trading outside the country shows that net buying has continued during that time.Instead, the bank wrote that it sees hedge funds as the primary culprit behind the brisk sell-off. \"We believe that much of the selling of US equities YTD has been driven by equity-focused hedge funds such as Equity Long/Short funds, both quant and discretionary. We estimate that these investors have sold around $750bn of equities YTD,\" the analysts wrote. JPMorgan\"This hedge fund selling impulse is also consistent with the large negative impulse we detect in US equity futures YTD, particularly in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts.\"Some have also pointed to April's erratic bond sell-off as a more assertive sign that foreigners are giving up on America. Treasury bond yields shot up aggressively earlier this month as Trump unleashed his tariff policy. But so far, data points to \"modest selling\" of non-domiciled US bond ETFs, JPMorgan wrote.The Institute of International Finance was similarly unconvinced. \"Based on weekly custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (through April 9), there is no sign of major foreign selling. Indeed, the share of U.S. Treasuries held by foreign investors has been gradually declining since 2015, following a peak that year,\" the IIF wrote in mid-April.\"On the flip side, recent auctions for 10-year and 30-year Treasuries (April 9 and April 11, respectively) suggest strong overall demand.\"JPMorganEarlier in the year, market commentators suggested that US market exceptionalism was over, making European and Asian equities more appealing to international buyers. Though American stocks were the obvious choice in recent years, excessive valuations have made them a harder sell in 2025.However, this too is not a reason to bet on a foreign retreat, JPMorgan said. Historically, periods of persistent US underperformance failed to lead to a meaningful international sell-off.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Getty Images; Tyler Le/BIEvery year, private equity recruiters hold a week of speed-dating recruiting for junior talent.Known as \"on-cycle,\" the practice has drawn critics, including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon.See how to get ahead of the fast-approaching interview frenzy — and who should avoid it.Imagine graduating from college with a six-figure investment banking job lined up. You might be planning to backpack across Europe, or just to get as much sleep as possible before the grueling 80+ hour workweeks begin.Then, perhaps while sitting in a French hostel, a private equity recruiter will reach out to insist that you start interviewing as soon as possible for a job that won't start for two years.Welcome to the private equity recruiting storm known as on-cycle recruiting. Nobody, not even the recruiters, knows when it will begin. According to an Amity Search Partners newsletter, the process began on August 29 in 2022, July 21 in 2023, and June 24 in 2024.Once one firm kicks it off, however, potential candidates (mostly junior investment bankers) can be expected to drop everything to interview, including vacation plans or training for their investment banking jobs, as Business Insider has previously reported.Unsurprisingly, the practice has its fair share of critics, including executives of the investment banks targeted by PE poachers. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the practice \"unethical\" and said that he might try to eliminate it at his bank.Even some private equity firms have been sitting out for fear that the process, which used to take place in the fall, has gotten so early that it's forcing candidates to make decisions they're not ready to make, industry insiders told BI.We spoke to recruiters with experience filling entry-level private equity roles to understand how the process works, how to know if it is worth it, and how to prepare.They said that on-cycle recruitment tends to be a small fraction of private equity recruiting, so there's no harm in waiting. If you want to try your hand at it, however, you'd better be ready well before the starting gun sounds.It can't hurt to waitOn-cycle is not the only path to an entry-level private equity role.According to numbers compiled by Danielle Strazzini, cofounder at Bellcast Partners, it only results in at most 10% of the roles hired for any year's associate class in private equity, leaving plenty of room for other interviewing opportunities.\"It's become such a small part of recruiting,\" Strazzini said, adding that \"off-cycle is the story.\"Other recruiters agreed. Holly McCarthy, founder of Opus Advisors, said that the majority of her firm's recent work at the associate level is to fill roles that will start in the next few months, not the next few years.\"The predominance of our search work more recently has been for summer 2025 start dates, not 2026 or 2027,\" she said.Only engage when you're readyThe only firms hunting during on-cycle are megafunds. The logic is that by going early, these firms can pick off the most qualified candidates.So, who should think about on-cycle recruiting? Only those who have thoroughly prepared for it.\"There are those kids who know freshman year that they want to go into private equity, whose parent, neighbor, or friend works in the industry, and have been reading the Wall Street Journal since they were in elementary school,\" said Strazzini.In other words, people who know exactly what they want and who already have a job at a top-tier bank. People who interview before they're ready risk tarnishing their reputations, recruiters said.\"First impressions matter, and candidates should begin recruiting when they are ready,\" Shannon Simons, managing director at Opus Advisors said. \"You shouldn't go with the herd.\"She noted that firms are unlikely to re-interview a candidate who didn't perform well in the next year's recruiting cycle. \"They typically don't give second looks.\"\"There's a real danger of putting your hat in the ring too early and not performing,\" Strazzini said, explaining that it is better to develop your technical and professional skills through your job as a junior banker.Just don't wait too long, McCarthy said, explaining that candidates who engage at the end of their two-year banking arrangements may have to answer questions about why they waited, or why they don't already have an offer.Be upfront about what you wantYou may have clear ideas about your path that align with your current investment banking role, such as healthcare or media mergers. Even if you're a generalist, it's important to know what you want before engaging with the recruiting process, Strazzini said.This extends to considerations about where you want to live, whether in New York, Chicago, or Charlotte, North Carolina, and the size of the fund: a megafund may offer more options for lateral moves, while a smaller firm can offer more hands-on opportunities.\"The more specific you can be, it helps your recruiters, and it helps your interviewers believe you actually want to work at that specific firm,\" Strazzini said.Otherwise, you'll be inundated with options, and there's a good chance your interviewers won't find you as passionate as other interviewees.Simons gave the example of a candidate who gives generic answers about the consumer sector, suggesting they care more about the fund's brand name than the specifics of the job. \"Compare that to a candidate who said they started reselling sneakers in the fifth grade, or someone can talk for hours about the trends in the beauty sector,\" she said.While candidates may think having a broad search aperture will be advantageous, the on-cycle recruiting process is lightning quick, so time is your greatest resource. Therefore, it's best to be upfront with your recruiter about what you want.\"Don't take interviews during on-cycle with firms that you're not interested in,\" Hilary Hurley, managing director at Amity Search Partners, told BI. \"It's a time crunch, and you want to preserve your time for firms that you're really excited about.\"How to get readyIf you're ready for on-cycle recruiting, you'll probably know it. You'll likely have attended an on-campus recruiting event offered by a recruiter, gone through the top internships, and have a job offer from one of the big-name banks after graduation.Recruiters also suggest using study guides like those provided, for a fee, by Peak Frameworks or ReCalc. They will give you a chance to try your hand at building a model or passing a case study. If you struggle with these guides, recruiters suggest you don't jump into the on-cycle recruiting cyclone.\"The test is very binary, pass or fail,\" Simons said. \"You'll know if your returns are correct, and if your balance sheet balances. Your model should tie together in a neat bow.\"Candidates should think of their recruiters as not only the firm's first round of assessment but also as their own career counselor. It's important to be transparent with your recruiter, said Hurley, as this means they'll make sure you are applying for the right roles.\"If the candidate is upfront that they would never want to work for a healthcare fund, it doesn't make sense to take an interview with a healthcare fund,\" Hurley said.Recruiters get paid to place candidates and want to ensure they're spending their time wisely.\"We are the buffer for firms and they're hiring us to give them a curated list of high-quality, vetted candidates,\" McCarthy said.It's also important to do your research on the firms you plan to interview with. Also, try to network before your interviews and send a thank-you note afterward—just don't overdo it.\"Making a connection at a firm can provide useful insight and demonstrate authentic interest\" McCarthy said. \"But realize they are busy and may not be able to respond.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Getty Images; Tyler Le/BIEvery year, private equity recruiters hold a week of speed-dating recruiting for junior talent.Known as \"on-cycle,\" the practice has drawn critics, including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon.See how to get ahead of the fast-approaching interview frenzy — and who should avoid it.Imagine graduating from college with a six-figure investment banking job lined up. You might be planning to backpack across Europe, or just to get as much sleep as possible before the grueling 80+ hour workweeks begin.Then, perhaps while sitting in a French hostel, a private equity recruiter will reach out to insist that you start interviewing as soon as possible for a job that won't start for two years.Welcome to the private equity recruiting storm known as on-cycle recruiting. Nobody, not even the recruiters, knows when it will begin. According to an Amity Search Partners newsletter, the process began on August 29 in 2022, July 21 in 2023, and June 24 in 2024.Once one firm kicks it off, however, potential candidates (mostly junior investment bankers) can be expected to drop everything to interview, including vacation plans or training for their investment banking jobs, as Business Insider has previously reported.Unsurprisingly, the practice has its fair share of critics, including executives of the investment banks targeted by PE poachers. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the practice \"unethical\" and said that he might try to eliminate it at his bank.Even some private equity firms have been sitting out for fear that the process, which used to take place in the fall, has gotten so early that it's forcing candidates to make decisions they're not ready to make, industry insiders told BI.We spoke to recruiters with experience filling entry-level private equity roles to understand how the process works, how to know if it is worth it, and how to prepare.They said that on-cycle recruitment tends to be a small fraction of private equity recruiting, so there's no harm in waiting. If you want to try your hand at it, however, you'd better be ready well before the starting gun sounds.It can't hurt to waitOn-cycle is not the only path to",

        "description": "The firm promotes new MDs each spring, but doesn't make the names public. Business Insider obtained the full list for global banking and markets. People walking by JPMorgan Chase's Manhattan office towerMomo Takahashi/BIJPMorgan promoted 118 people in global banking and markets to managing director.The bank began announcing the new MDs internally on Monday, a person familiar with the matter said.Business Insider obtained the full list in global banking and markets — take a look.JPMorgan Chase this week promoted 118 people in global banking and markets to the rank of managing director, the firm's highest designation outside of the C-suite.The number is up slightly from the 116 executives the firm elevated to managing director in these business lines last year. The new MDs sit within JPMorgan's commercial and investment banking unit, which advises companies with mergers and stock sales and facilitates trades for large investors. In addition to bankers and traders, the company also elevated people who work in functions like legal, risk, and compliance.The bank began internally announcing promotions across the company on Monday, a person familiar with the matter said. It's part of an annual investment banking ritual the bank engages in each April.Eighty-six of this year's new MDs in the division sit within banking, including M&A advisory and corporate lending; another 32 are in markets. An analysis of the new managing directors' LinkedIn profiles shows they stem from all over the world. Some are based in New York or Dallas; others in London, Frankfurt, or Singapore. As of press time, many members of this year's MD class had not updated their LinkedIn pages with their new roles, leaving the title of \"Executive Director,\" one rung below MD, in their profiles.The commercial and investment bank generated roughly $19.7 billion in revenue for the first quarter of the year, according to the bank's most recent earnings figures; that's up nearly 12% year over year. Banking and payments revenue of $8.7 billion was up 4% year over year; markets and securities services revenue was up 19%. (Markets-specific revenue of $9.7 billion was up 21%, the firm said, amid heightened equities activity.) Overall, JPMorgan said this month that it produced $14.6 billion in net income for the quarter.\"Clients have become more cautious amid an increase in market volatility driven by geopolitical and trade-related tensions,\" Jamie Dimon, the company's CEO, said in a statement accompanying the release. He also recently addressed a variety of issues facing the economic and US democracy, including stagflation and the specter of a possible recession, in his annual shareholder letter.Last year, JPMorgan was the third-ranked M&A advisor globally (after Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) and second-ranked in the US (after Goldman), according to the deal tracking firm Dealogic. Globally, the firm advised on 403 transactions with a total deal value of about $760 billion; in the US, specifically, it worked on 228 deals with value of roughly $481 billion, Dealogic found.JPMorgan's MD promotions in the division come as investment banking, generally, has confronted headwinds under the Trump administration. The chilling effect of tariffs and trade wars roiled markets and spooked investors in recent weeks, contributing to a global selloff that has stalled the M&A and IPO pipelines.In addition to its commercial and investment bank, the firm also conducts promotions in its other businesses, ranging from tech to asset management.Here's the full list of names of 118 new managing directors in global banking and markets.Global BankingDaniel Adams, global investment bankingBrent Ballard Jr., global investment bankingAlex Bilichenko, global investment bankingHenry Capper, global investment bankingHenri de Branche, global investment bankingJon Edwards, global investment bankingJason Gorak, commercial bankingJeanne Ho, commercial bankingEd Johnson, commercial bankingSid Lahiri, global investment bankingJustin Look, global investment bankingMithil Mehta, global investment bankingGabor Pogany Ritter, global corporate bankingSebastian Rodriguez, global investment bankingMahesh Ahlawat, global investment bankingJeff Barker, commercial bankingLisa Bono, commercial bankingMei Chang, global investment bankingIngrid Deroubaix, commercial bankingOmar El Amine Fichtali, global investment bankingBen Grant, global investment bankingMatt Holdaway, global servicesTucker Kaufmann, commercial bankingYing Li, global corporate bankingLouis Magraner, global investment bankingStephen Molloy, global investment bankingMatt Renna, commercial bankingVictor Ruiz, commercial bankingMarc Andersen, global investment bankingGina Baumgartner, global servicesChiara Bovo, global investment bankingZuriel Chavez, global investment bankingPaul Drayton, commercial bankingMarc Epstein, commercial bankingJulia Grinshpun, commercial bankingGraham Holden, global investment bankingSonam Khare, global investment bankingStephanie Little, global corporate bankingBrandon Mallette, global investment bankingCharlie Oakes, global investment bankingMichael Rhodes, commercial bankingLy-Yen Sacco, global corporate bankingIsabela Bacchi, global corporate bankingLouise Bennetts, global investment bankingGauthier Brizard, global corporate bankingLorenzo Colonna di Paliano, commercial bankingAnjali Dubey, product & experienceHideo Fujimoto, global investment bankingTiffany Hatchett, commercial bankingSaiko Hoshino, global investment bankingJaewon Kim, global corporate bankingNiklas Ljungquist, global corporate bankingHasan Mannan, commercial bankingViraj Patel, global investment bankingMike Rhodes, global investment bankingJay Sanghani, global investment bankingKeats Baldwin III, commercial bankingBruno Biagini, global investment bankingJason Campbell, commercial bankingAly Cunningham, commercial bankingJonty Edwards, global investment bankingLisa Gomez, commercial bankingAaron Hilton, global servicesParul Jhunjhunwala, global investment bankingArjan Kreischer, global investment bankingDoug Loftus, commercial bankingBen McNulty, global investment bankingBryan Payne, global investment bankingEric Rinder, global investment bankingEric Schwarzbach, global corporate bankingDuncan Sennott, commercial bankingJames Summer, global investment bankingAbel Thai, global servicesJim Tomtania, commercial bankingHaley Trethaway, global investment bankingManoj Vemula, global investment bankingAnastasia Volnova, global investment bankingTeresa Walker, commercial bankingSheria Washington, commercial bankingGregor Weber, global corporate bankingPhillip Wiginton, commercial bankingFlorian Will, global corporate bankingDaisuke Yoshizumi, global investment bankingPeck Yuen Yong, global servicesChristine Zhang, global corporate bankingFei-Fei Zhang, global investment bankingMarketsShalabh AgrawalMark AmlinTaoufik BounharAaron CasdenPatrick ChuAmelie DarrortAlex DaumCyprien DecouxIrina DushkevichKer Lih GanSarah GangFelix GrimauSiddharth GuptaAndrew Hart-FoxMoulay JaidiManish JainJason KendallAlexander KueblerElisa LassMatt LegerEmma MaAnnie MarinaroChristopher J McCannYasuhiro NishikawaMeghan O'KeefeRuchira PatelWill PeakMatt PennellaJohn SchlegelMichael SistoRob Tanna-SmithShilong YangHave a tip?

        "description": "The firm expects the effective tariff rate to fall between 10% to 20% when Trump's trade war is all said and done. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesJPMorgan published new research laying out its base case for where Trump ends up with tariffs.Under this scenario, the effective tariff rate would land in the 10%-to-20% range. The firm lays out adjustments investors can make in response to the new tariff-heavy environment.JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield \"some deals\" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size.In new research, the global investment strategy team at JPMorgan Wealth Management outlined its base case for Trump's tariffs. Under the scenario, the firm says the effective tax rate would be between 10% and 20%, up markedly from 2% at the start of the year.This \"represents a meaningful increase in import duties but lands within Wall Street estimates pre-'Liberation Day,'\" the firm wrote.Trump has touted the protectionist pivot as a forceful negotiating tactic to elicit better trade deals. By achieving some — and then reducing the tariff rates to that 10%-to-20% baseline — JPMorgan predicts that a US recession will be narrowly avoided.The firm warns, however, that unemployment and inflation would still weigh on economic growth.JPMorgan laid two main recommendations for qualifying investors looking to stay safe and perhaps even capitalize on a more volatile environment:Structured notesThe firm says structured notes can simultaneously provide defensive exposure to stocks while delivering income through options premiums. This strategy generates income in a volatile environment, albeit at the expense of some upside.Hedge funds in diversified portfoliosJPMorgan says that volatility will give hedge funds more opportunities to \"exploit market mispricings and relative value plays across asset classes.\" The firm also seems them offering diversification and hedged downside during declines.Read the original article on Business Insider",

As earnings season kicked off last week, JPMorgan’s CFO Jeremy Barnum said on the conference call with analysts that consumers had been front-loading their spending ahead of anticipated price increases from tariffs. That scramble to buy goods showed up in the latest data on retails sales for March, capturing a surge that notched the highest month-on-month gain seen in two years. The headline number from the Census Bureau on Wednesday (April 16) indicated that overall spending was up 1.4% last month, measured over February’s levels. Not surprisingly, the big-ticket items — vehicles and electronics — logged the most outsized gains. New Wheels in the Driveway? Motor vehicle and parts dealers performed strongly in March, growing 5.3% over the month after contractions in January (-3.4%) and February (-1.6%). Compared to March 2024, the sector experienced an 8.8% increase. Building materials and garden equipment sales also surged, reaching $41.4 billion in March — a 3.3% month-over-month increase, the largest since March 2021 — partially offsetting declines observed since last October. As for some of the more discretionary big-ticket items, electronics and appliances showed positive growth, with a 0.8% increase in March following a 0.5% rise in February, achieving $7.2 billion in sales — a 1.8% year-over-year increase. But there were some indications that consumers and households bought new wheels and TVs at the expense of other categories. Furniture and home furnishing stores reported $11.7 billion in sales, reflecting a 0.7% month-over-month decline, though sales were still up 7.7% compared to March 2024. Department stores — which are key channels for home furnishings — performed poorly for the second consecutive month, with sales declining 0.3% in March and 1.6% in February, resulting in a 2.5% decrease compared to March 2024. The takeaway here is that the surge in home remodeling and revamping the curtains in the living room among consumers may be ebbing. An Appetite to Keep Spending on Dining Out U.S. retail and food services sales, adjusted for seasonal variations, totaled $734.9 billion, marking a 1.4% increase from February and a 4.6% rise compared to March 2024. Sales for the January-March period were up 4.1% compared to the same period in 2024. && Meanwhile, food services and drinking places rebounded after weaker performances in previous months, growing 1.8% in March to reach $98.3 billion in sales, a 4.8% year-over-year increase. Grocery store sales remained relatively stable throughout 2025, with marginal monthly increases of 0.1% in January and March and 0.2% in February (a revised figure). && The pull-forward in spending into the end of March seems to have come through brick-and-mortar channels. The non-store category of sales — which includes eCommerce — was up only 0.1%, where those figures had been up more than 2% in February. The big-ticket spending among consumers has been no doubt financed at least in part by debt: JPMorgan’s results, to use one proxy, indicated that credit card spending was up 4%. Average auto loans at the bank were up in the March quarter to $86.1 billion from the year-end average of $85.3 billion, as can be seen in the latest earnings materials. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) players such as Affirm have yet to report results, but the March frenzy in spending, evidenced by the Census data, likely gave a boost to merchandise volumes. PYMNTS Intelligence has noted that the U.S. market for BNPL credit totals $175 billion, and that tally has jumped 88-fold in just six years. What lies ahead is anyone’s guess, as consumer confidence, discussed here, has been dismal, particularly on the subjects of inflation and on assessment of household finances — and that was before the tariffs really took effect earlier this month. March’s retail sales gains may prove fleeting as a result. The post Online Sales Muted as Consumers Rush to Buy Cars and TVs Ahead of Tariffs appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Several of the largest U.S. banks are reportedly pausing or reassessing how they send sensitive information to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) following a major cyberattack on the regulator. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon have halted electronic information-sharing with the OCC, Bloomberg reported. Bank of America is working to transmit data through what it considers more secure electronic channels, according to the report. The moves come after hackers reportedly accessed more than 100 accounts within the OCC’s email system over the course of a year—a breach the OCC and U.S. Treasury have labeled a “major incident.” The attackers are believed to have obtained highly sensitive information about financial firms, though the identity of the hackers remains unknown. Banks have expressed growing concern over the breach and the OCC’s handling of its disclosure, The Wall Street Journal reported. Many institutions are still unclear about the specific information that may have been compromised. The OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, regulates and supervises more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and the U.S. branches of foreign banks. The agency is currently being led on an acting basis by Rodney Hood, a former member of the National Credit Union Administration Board. Among the types of sensitive information banks send to the OCC are reports on cybersecurity practices and National Security Letters, which can include classified details related to terrorism and espionage, according to Bloomberg.",

Of the U.S.-China […] The post Jamie Dimon Urges Immediate US Engagement With China Over Tariffs appeared first on PYMNTS.com. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the President Donald Trump administration should quickly initiate negotiations with China and United States allies to end the uncertainty around tariffs. The uncertainty is making people unsure they can “rely on America,” Dimon said, in an interview with the Financial Times published Tuesday (April 15). Of the U.S.-China trade war, Dimon said, per the report: “I don’t think there’s any engagement right now … it doesn’t have to wait a year. It could start tomorrow.” Of U.S. allies, he said: “I would want to negotiate eventually with Europe, with the U.K., with Japan, Korea, Australia, Philippines, and have a very strong economic relationship.” The announced tariffs — which were “dramatically different” from what people had expected — together with the subsequent changes in trade policies and attacks on independent regulators, have led some investors to question America’s position as the world’s leading market, Dimon said in the report. “We should be careful,” Dimon said, per the report. “I don’t think anyone should assume they have a divine right to success and therefore don’t worry about it.” During a Tuesday press conference, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a statement from Trump in which he said, “The ball is in China’s court.” “China needs to make a deal with us; we don’t have to make a deal with them,” Leavitt said, sharing the statement in a video posted on social platform X by the White House’s Rapid Response 47 account. “There’s no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger, and China wants what we have, what every country wants, what we have, the American consumer. Or, to put it another way, they need our money.” .@PressSec shares a statement from @POTUS: “The ball is in China’s court. China needs to make a deal with us; we don’t have to make a deal with them.

China ships more than $400 billion in goods to the U.S. per year, more than any other country, and its exporters are seeing their U.S. orders either disappear or get placed on hold. In the U.S., consumers are taking a harder look at their spending and budgeting amid the prospect of tariffs potentially pushing price tags higher, according to PYMNTS Intelligence’s forthcoming installment in its “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series.

A Bloomberg report released late Monday (April 14) says that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon have scaled back electronic information sharing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) following a significant breach of the regulator’s email system. Bloomberg cited individuals familiar with the matter. The breach, detected in mid-February but impacting over 100 accounts for more than a year, is deemed a “major incident” by the OCC and the U.S. Treasury. The compromised emails may contain highly sensitive data provided by banks, including details on their financial health, cybersecurity protections, vulnerability assessments, and even the content of National Security Letters. These letters often involve confidential information related to terrorism and espionage investigations. According to Bloomberg, the banks’ decision to limit information sharing stems from concerns about potential security risks to their own computer networks in the wake of the OCC breach. Representatives for JPMorgan and BNY declined to comment. A spokesperson for the OCC told the network that the agency is working with third-party cybersecurity experts to review the hack and its IT security policies and is keeping supervised institutions informed. The OCC also affirmed that onsite examiners retain necessary access to bank information. Citigroup, operating under a tighter OCC consent order, has reportedly not limited its information sharing. It remains unclear if other major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have taken similar actions as JPMorgan and BNY. Bloomberg’s sources indicate that some banks were unaware of the breach’s full extent until recent reporting, raising questions about the OCC’s initial response and security measures. The OCC is still working to determine the exact scope of the data compromised and whether affected banks need to be notified. The incident has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which are seeking more information from the OCC. David P. Weber, a former OCC enforcement counsel, described the banks’ actions as a “historic” challenge to the regulator’s authority, signaling a “fundamental breakdown of the examination authority of the OCC.” Experts quoted in the Bloomberg report warn that the compromised material could be used for targeted cyberattacks or extortion against banks. The breach highlights the cybersecurity risks within the financial sector and has eroded trust between banks and their regulator. The OCC has disclosed some affected staff accounts to the banks but has not yet detailed the types of data stolen, including cybersecurity-related information.

In a move signaling intensified competition in the cross-border payments space, J.P. Morgan Chase has introduced GBP-denominated Blockchain Deposit Accounts for its Kinexys Digital Payments (KDP) platform in London. The bank said it’s one of the first products of its kind in the U.K. with live corporate clients. Trading market infrastructure company LSEG is among the first to open an account. Its SwapAgent division and global commodities firm Trafigura will are the first to open London-based blockchain accounts, which aim to streamline 24/7 real-time payments and foreign exchange (FX) settlements across global financial centers. This roll-out expands upon earlier Kinexys launches — most notably, the EUR-denominated blockchain accounts in Frankfurt — and underscores the firm’s push to increase operational efficiency and reduce transaction friction for multinational corporations. Key Points From the Announcement: 24/7 Cross-Border Transactions: Clients can now seamlessly transact among USD, EUR and GBP anytime, including on weekends and beyond traditional branch cut-off times. Enhanced FX Capabilities: By integrating same-day and near-real-time settlements into its blockchain framework, J.P. Morgan Chase provides improved flexibility and speed for corporate treasury operations. SwapAgent, an LSEG Post Trade Solutions business, plans to leverage these new accounts for its digital post-trade services pilot project, with a view to broadening its blockchain adoption. “Integrating the innovative Kinexys Digital Payments blockchain deposit accounts into our SwapAgent offerings could allow us to operate beyond traditional branch cut-off times and manage settlements in a programmable manner in the future,” said Nathan Ondyak, CEO at SwapAgent. Meanwhile, Trafigura, one of the world’s largest commodities suppliers, plans to harness the London-based accounts to support 24/7 global payments across financial hubs in New York, London and Singapore. Chris McLaughlin, Global Head of Group Treasury at Trafigura, said the collaboration “will enable us with 24/7 near-real-time payments across major global financial centers” and offer greater efficiency for real-time cross-border transactions. According to J.P. Morgan, since its inception in 2019, the Kinexys platform has processed over $1.5 trillion in transaction volume, with average daily transactions exceeding $2 billion and registering 10x year-over-year growth in payments. In addition to deposit accounts, KDP provides a Programmable Payments feature with an “if-this-then-that” interface, allowing corporate clients to automate treasury workflows and enhance liquidity management. In November, J.P. Morgan announced a significant enhancement to its blockchain platform, recently rebranded from Onyx to Kinexys. The bank will integrate Kinexys Digital Payments with J.P. Morgan FX Services, enabling on-chain FX settlement. This move positions Kinexys as a key player in the landscape of digital cross-border payments and foreign exchange. Initially supporting USD and EUR, with plans to expand to other currencies, this integration allowed clients to execute near real-time FX transactions and settlements via the J.P. Morgan global FX platform. This is expected to significantly reduce FX settlement risk and accelerate trade settlements, potentially revolutionizing how businesses manage international payments. “Together with our clients, we aim to move beyond the limitations of legacy technology and realize the promise of a multichain world,” said Umar Farooq, co-head of J.P. Morgan Payments said at the time. “Our goal is to foster a more connected ecosystem to break down disparate systems, enable greater interoperability and reduce the limitations of today’s financial infrastructure.” The post JPMorgan Chase’s Kinexys Broadens FX Reach With New GBP Blockchain Rollout appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The whipsaw action in stocks — as tariffs were on, then (largely) off with a 90-day pause, and then focused on China (mostly) — brought the markets back from the brink of bear territory by the end of last week. But the volatility, of course, is not over yet. As earnings season got off to its official start, executives sounded the alarm on consumer spending. Beyond earnings, the latest survey by the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment indicated that households are more pessimistic about inflation, the current state of affairs and the future than they have been in years. The 90-day pause on tariffs led to a relief rally. Investors snapped up shares at the end of the week, helping drive the CE 100 Index up by 4.9%. All pillars gained ground. Banking stocks in the CE 100 index nudged up 5.6% last week compared to the prior week, according to PYMNTS data. The trend reversed some losses that had been hitting the sector for several days after the initial round of tariffs was announced early in the month. JPMorgan Weighs In The top earnings newsmaker among financial institutions in the CE 100 index last week was J.P. Morgan, whose stock spiked 12.3% for the week. The bank announced $14.6 billion in first-quarter earnings on Friday (April 11), a 9% boost compared to the year-ago level. In PYMNTS’ coverage of Friday’s earnings, the bank increased loan loss provisions designed to cover possible loan losses amid economic turbulence. Spending on credit and debit cards slowed a bit, to 7% in the first quarter, and down from the 8% pace seen in the final three months of the year. Commentary on the call indicated that consumers were “front-loading” their spending amid fears of a trade war. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and trade wars, ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a Friday press release. “As always, we hope for the best but prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios.” The data showed that credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. Payments Name Gain Ground Payments-focused names in the CE 100 index gathered 7.7%. Affirm and Sezzle led advancing stocks in the group, up a respective 34.5% and 13.3%. In company-specific news, Affirm and Shopify have expanded their pay-later offering beyond U.S. borders. Shopify merchants in Canada who have signed up for early access can begin offering the Affirm-powered Shop Pay Installments program, marking its first availability outside the U.S. Mastercard and crypto platform Kraken launched a payments-focused partnership. The collaboration will allow Kraken customers in the United Kingdom and Europe to spend crypto assets at more than 150 million merchants that accept Mastercard. The payments network’s shares gained 4.1% through the week. Even companies in the Move segment of the CE 100 index that were explicit about the uncertain state of affairs gained momentum. As reported this past week, and in its earnings report, Delta Air Lines saw year-over-year revenue growth of 3.3% in the March quarter as it dealt with what management termed “broad economic uncertainty.” Revenues aligned with expectations, but the firm offered no updates on its outlook for the current year. Elsewhere in Delta’s financials, revenue was up 7% in premium products, 11% in loyalty travel rewards and mid-single digits in its international business, while revenue was down 1% in the main cabin and 3% in domestic segments. Among declining names, Zillow shares lost 8%. The real estate platform said this week it would ban certain listings — namely, those marketed to select buyers. “If a listing is marketed directly to consumers without being listed on the MLS and made widely available where buyers search for homes, it will not be published on Zillow,” the company said. Nike’s stock lost 5% as the tariff-related tumult weighed on the name. Nike has particular exposure to Vietnam for its supply chain; China is also a key market for its top line.

        "description": "Jamie DimonNoam Galai/Getty ImagesJPMorgan's 1Q earnings call was focused more on what the bank's data might say about the economy.Banks execs said consumers are front-loading spending as corporate clients pause activity.Jamie Dimon pushed for a quick resolution of trade deals to stabilize the global economy.Consumers are trying to front-run tariffs, companies are in \"wait-and-see\" mode, and market volatility shows no sign of waning.These are just some of the trends to emerge from JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter earnings call on Friday as analysts and investors clamored for insights into how Trump's tariff policies might be impacting the broader economy. The bank reported better-than-expected results for the three months ending March 31, but all eyes were on what bank execs might have gleaned about the economy since Trump's tariff policies went into effect on April 2.CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum described an economy that is still intact but bracing for trouble ahead. Consumers are still spending, but some of that is \"front-loading spending\" to get ahead of tariffs, Barnum said. Companies have paused spending and investing until they see how tariffs shake out, while lenders are building cash reserves to protect against rising delinquencies. The one bright spot is the bank trading desks, which are busier than ever as investors try to navigate whip-saws in stocks, bonds, and interest rates, the execs said.JPMorgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli, is predicting a 50/50 chance of recession, Dimon said. Whether that happens, he added, will depend on a range of factors including tariffs, but also how the nation deals with the US deficit, regulations, and the changing geopolitical landscape. Dimon, who has reprised his role as the industry's elder statesman amid the tariff chaos, pushed the Trump administration to reach a quick resolution on trade deals to stabilize the global economy.\"I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve — for better or for worse — in the next four months,\" Dimon said. \"So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We actually know what the effect of some of these things was,\" he said.Consumer spending patternsChief financial officer Jeremy Barnum broke down some changes to consumer spending patterns based on the company's credit card data, but was cautious about drawing conclusions, saying it's too early to know.\"Another thing that we are seeing, looking at the April data, would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might have prices go up as a function of tariffs,\" Barnum said.The company saw some weakening in spending among lower-income consumers but \"no evidence of distress.\" In fact, he said, some of the increases in April spending were driven by lower-income consumers.Barnum also said the bank has seen a dip in spending on travel but was reluctant to draw conclusions about whether this suggests a tightening of the purse strings.\"It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns,\" Barnum said. \"There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.\"Loans and liquidityThe bank boosted the amount it sets aside for credit losses by $973 million to $3.3 billion, citing a worse macroeconomic outlook.Barnum said JPMorgan is not yet seeing a deterioration of lending quality, and loans are still being paid at the expected rate. Still, the bank is building reserves of $441 million for consumer lending and $549 million for wholesale lending to protect against people and companies not paying their loans.Barnum said the firm has not seen \"meaningful, observable draws\" from clients, suggesting that client are not withdrawing their funds or using up their lines of credit to deal with losses. Some of the firm's large institutional clients have discussed shoring up liquidity, he said, adding that the firm has not seen clients taking out more loans to meet those liquidity needs. Loans tied to market activity have increased, however.Trading and bankingBoth JPMorgan and its crosstown rival Morgan Stanley posted strong first-quarter revenues tied to their role executing trades for large investors, a trend that's only expected to have accelerated since Trump's tariffs sent markets spinning on April 2.\"I think this just happened to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully,\" said Barnum.Barnum said that market conditions are causing them to adopt \"a cautious stance\" on the investment banking outlook and are seeing a \"wait-and-see\" attitude from corporate clients.\"I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude,\" Barnum said. \"I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve.\"What's at stakeDimon called upon the Trump administration to finish negotiating trade deals and get it done sooner rather than later.\"I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make around tariffs and with our trading partners,\" he said. \"That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.\"When asked how the current economic and political situation compares to the past, Dimon said it remains to be seen. While tariffs and the economy are important, the priority should be on maintaining our geopolitical alliances.\"This is different. This is the global economy,\" he said in response to an analyst's question. \"The most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically, when we get through all this, and militarily, to keep the world safe and free for democracy. That is the most important thing.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Jamie DimonNoam Galai/Getty ImagesJPMorgan's 1Q earnings call was focused more on what the bank's data might say about the economy.Banks execs said consumers are front-loading spending as corporate clients pause activity.Jamie Dimon pushed for a quick resolution of trade deals to stabilize the global economy.Consumers are trying to front-run tariffs, companies are in \"wait-and-see\" mode, and market volatility shows no sign of waning.These are just some of the trends to emerge from JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter earnings call on Friday as analysts and investors clamored for insights into how Trump's tariff policies might be impacting the broader economy.

[…] The post JPMorgan Credit and Debit Volumes Slow as Reserve for Card Losses Grows appeared first on PYMNTS.com. For J.P. Morgan, caution abounds as the bank increased loan loss provisions, designed to cover possible loan losses amid economic turbulence. Management discussed on a conference call Friday (April 11) discussing first-quarter earnings that at the moment, credit performance is in line with expectations, but its outlook also includes an upward revision to expected unemployment. An earnings presentation showed at least some pressure on consumers, as spending on credit and debit cards slowed a bit, to 7% in the first quarter, and down from the 8% pace seen in the final three months of the year. Commentary on the call indicated that consumers were “front-loading” their spending ahead of looming tariffs, which are now a reality. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and ‘trade wars, ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a Friday press release. “As always, we hope for the best but prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios.” J.P. Morgan shares were up 1% in intraday trading Friday. The data showed that credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. “Let’s take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks,” Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said during the conference call. “Our first-quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our [current expected credit loss (CECL)] framework.” And amid the company’s assumptions of what lies ahead, J.P. Morgan has boosted its assumptions on unemployment to 5.8% for the year, up from 5.5%. Steady Metrics, for Now “It is important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations,” Barnum said on the call. Forward guidance has kept the 3.6% net charge-off ratio in the card business that had previously been guided. “Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment-to-income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations,” he said. Average deposits were down 2% year on year and flat sequentially. Within the card portfolio, loan balances were up 10% due to strong account acquisition, per Barnum’s commentary. “In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the investment banking outlook,” he said during the call. “While client engagement and dialogue is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty.” Front-Loading Ahead of Tariffs Asked about the change in activity observed across consumer and corporate clients, Barnum said, “At a high level, I would say that obviously some of the salient news flow is quite recent. We’ve done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data, and to be honest, the main thing that we see there is what would appear to be a certain amount of front-loading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs.” As for corporate clients, Barnum said, “Obviously they’ve been reacting to the changes in tariff policy, and at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the investment banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they’re going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we’re hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude.” Asked later during the call about the economic environment, Dimon said that “if the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, yield curves can change. We’re not predicting all of that.” He said that according to J.P. Morgan economists, the odds of a recession are about 50%, “so I’ll just refer to that. Obviously, if there’s a recession, credit losses will go up, and other factors will change too.” In discussing consumer spending and the slowdown on cards, Barnum said, “We obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we’re seeing that too through the card spend. It’s not obvious to us that that’s necessarily an indicator for broader patterns… Another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically on items that might have prices go up. So, you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted, you hear anecdotes, and I’ve seen evidence of companies specifically advertising, ‘We have pre-tariff inventory’ and so on and so forth. So, it’s not that surprising that you’re seeing that a little bit in the spending data.” “When we look at our card data and also our cash buffers in people’s checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower-income segment,” he said. “But when you take a step back and you ask, ‘Are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment?’ The answer is no.” In a bit of contrary movement, some of the increases in spending that are in evidence have been coming from the lower-income segment, Barnum said.

Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock-traders delivered first-quarter revenue that exceeded analyst predictions, earning a record $4.13 billion from equities trading. The firm's wealth business saw higher-than-anticipated net new assets of $93.8 billion, and investment-banking fees rose 8% in the quarter.

Retail traders stayed bullish even as stocks saw their worst sell-off in five years over the last week.Noam Galai/Getty ImagesRetail portfolios gained 17% Wednesday as the market shot higher, JPMorgan said.Individual investors were consistent dip-buyers despite market turmoil over the past week.Nvidia was the biggest single-stock winner, garnering $3 billion in inflows.Relentless optimism in the face of market chaos paved the way to monster gains for individual investors who kept buying the dip as stocks cratered. Retail portfolios netted a 17% gain on Wednesday after indexes did a stunning about-face following an abrupt 90-day pause to US tariff policy. According to JPMorgan, that's helped boost retail's year-to-date performance to -0.8% compared to a 7% loss for the benchmark S&P 500.JPMorgan\"The willingness of Retail investors to place confidence on market upside despite radical policy uncertainty has clearly paid off,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote on Wednesday.Retail traders seemed unshaken by the market's massive fallout since last week, sparked by aggressive tariffs unveiled by the White House on April 2. While many analysts feared President Donald Trump's reciprocal duties could unleash a global trade war and kick off a recession, risk-on retail investors stayed bullish.In the same week that the S&P tanked 14% peak-to-trough, individual investors bought $11 billion of stock through Wednesday, the bank said, exceeding the last 12-month average.After a record $4.7 billion in inflows last Thursday, Tuesday and Wednesday raked in another $3.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. $1.5 billion in outflows occurred Monday, the highest level in the past two years.Nvidia, an enduring favorite among the retail crowd, was the biggest winner. The cohort bought $3.5 billion worth of single stocks, and the chipmaker accounted for about $3 billion of that, JPMorgan said.Meanwhile, it may be the case that dip-buying accelerated on Wednesday due to Trump's own prompting. The morning before he paused reciprocal duties on all countries but China, the president called on investors to \"BE COOL,\" adding that \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY.\"The pause caused indexes to spring up as much as 10%. In reaction, online retail traders suggested that this was a form of market manipulation, and the phrase briefly trended on X.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Zoom in: The semi-official arbiter of U.S. recessions is the business cycle dating committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private academic group.The committee consists of eight esteemed economists who study incoming data and assign dates to peaks and trough of the U.S. economic cycle.Zoom out: The committee defines a recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\"The data they specifically cite as particularly important for judging when a recession has begun include personal income (adjusted for inflation but excluding government transfers) and payroll employment.

Real personal income excluding transfers rose 0.3% in January, for example, and payrolls were up 151,000.When will we know if there's a recession?Yes, but: If the economy does turn negative, don't expect any official recession announcement to be speedy; they would rather be sure than be first to make a recession call.The group waits \"until it is confident that a recession has occurred,\" the NBER website says, with no doubt about when the economy peaked or bottomed.The committee did not declare the pandemic recession until July 2020. By then the recession had been over for two months.During the 2008 financial crisis, the NBER did not announce that the U.S. had been in a recession until a year after it had begun.Reality check: There are instances when it is obvious a recession is underway, even without the official NBER call — like when the pandemic brought economic activity to a standstill.Wall Street's rule-of-thumb for a recession is two back-to-back quarters of declining GDP. It is an imperfect gauge.Recall 2022 when GDP was reported to have contracted in the first and second quarter, even as the labor market chugged along fine.

In an interview Wednesday (April 9) with Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria” show, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called on the White House to make headway on negotiations with trading partners to ease the markets after days of turmoil. Dimon […] The post Jamie Dimon: Recession a ‘Likely Outcome’ of US Tariffs appeared first on PYMNTS.com. The CEO of America’s biggest bank says the country’s tariffs will likely trigger a recession. In an interview Wednesday (April 9) with Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria” show, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called on the White House to make headway on negotiations with trading partners to ease the markets after days of turmoil. Dimon urged fast progress on trade negotiations with U.S. trading partners in order to calm markets, which have been roiled by tariff announcements. If the situation persists, credit problems could worsen, he added. “Are you seeing defaults?” asked program host Maria Bartiromo. “Not yet, but I expect them,” Dimon said. “Do you personally expect a recession?” Bartiromo continued. “I think that’s probably a likely outcome,” Dimon added. He said he was “taking a calm view … but I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here.” Economists at the bank upped the chances of global recession during 2025 to 60% after President Donald Trump introduced new tariffs. Dimon also noted that initial public offerings (IPOs) were being called off due to the market upheaval. “The bad part of these volatile markets is … what it does to the capital markets and the ability of companies to raise money. So IPOs are being canceled, a couple of hung deals out there in the high-yield land, bridge loans, and that just slows everything down,” he said. Earlier this week, Dimon published his annual letter to the bank’s shareholders, in which he called for the tariff situation to be resolved quickly. “The United States has had a rather healthy and steady economy for years, although it was already weakening as I began writing this letter — and that was before the recent tariff announcement,” Dimon said. PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster examined the position U.S. businesses are in earlier this week, noting that supply chains that just recovered from COVID-era disruptions are likely to now face new levels of chaos thanks to the tariffs. “Among middle-market businesses in the consumer and industrial goods industries, an overwhelming 89% expect shortages, delays and higher costs for materials,” Webster wrote Monday (April 7). “These businesses are doing the best they can to make lemonade out of tariff lemons, with 26% stockpiling inventory and negotiating with suppliers for better prices before the full effects take hold.” The post Jamie Dimon: Recession a ‘Likely Outcome’ of US Tariffs appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "The stock sell-off stemming from tariffs \"feeds on itself,\" JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said, adding that he believed a recession looks likely. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon speaking in Washington, DC in October 2024.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesA recession has become a \"likely outcome\" for the US economy, according to Jamie Dimon.The JPMorgan CEO pointed to the recent decline in stocks stemming from tariffs.The global economy was already showing signs of weakness before the election, Dimon told Fox Business. An economic downturn is now looking increasingly likely in the US, according to JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon.The bank chief said he believed a recession was now a \"likely outcome\" for the US economy. That's evident partly in the sell-off stocks, Dimon said, pointing to the sell-off fueled by Trump's latest round of tariffs.\"I mean, when you see a 2,000-point decline, it sort of feeds on itself, doesn't it,\" Dimon said, speaking on Fox Business's \"Mornings with Maria\" on Wednesday. Dimon was referring to the 2,000-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its intraday peak on Tuesday. \"It makes you feel like you're losing money in your 401(k), you're losing money in your pension. You've got to cut back.\"Dimon said the economy was alson't on great footing prior to the presidential election, and tariffs had worsened the outlook. He pointed to rising geopolitical tensions, \"huge\" fiscal deficits in the US and other countries, and sticky inflation, which he believed would not go away quickly.\"So tariffs and trade are just part of that mix,\" he added.Dimon also sounded warnings about the US economy in his annual letter to shareholders, in which he warned that tariffs could slow growth and raise inflation.\"While inflation has come down, most of what I see in the future is inflationary: continued high fiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world, and the need for infrastructure investment, including the green economy and the restructuring of trade and tariffs,\" he wrote.At one point, Dimon also referenced stagflation, a scenario that involves weak growth and high inflation. Economists say such a situation could be even worse than a recession, as high inflation would leave the Fed unable to lower rates to boost the economy.\"This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates,\" he added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.KENA BETANCUR/Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon released his highly anticipated annual letter Monday.In it, the CEO addressed a variety of topics, including his advice for management.He admitted to some mistakes and encouraged execs to speak plainly and avoid backchanneling.Write your own memos. Keep lists. Don't waste time in meetings.These are just some of the management philosophies of Jamie Dimon, the billionaire banker and two-decade veteran CEO of America's biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase, which will report its first-quarter earnings later this week.In his newly released annual letter to shareholders — which the bank published on Monday — Dimon tackled a range of topics, from stagflation to the future of the US democracy. The CEO also outlined some of the \"management tricks and tools\" that have vaulted him to the zenith of Wall Street and corporate America.Among them: Make follow-up lists. Refrain from pulling Dimon aside after a meeting to surreptitiously share grievances. Author your own memorandums and go right to the source when you want answers, even if it means breaking through the chain of command.He reflected on a time when he worked through intermediaries while at Bank One, the firm he ran from 2000 to 2004 before JPMorgan Chase. One day, his wife phoned him to report that one of the firm's ATMs was malfunctioning.Within the walls of the bank, one of the executives Dimon spoke with assured him everything was fine. But when the executive drove out to inspect the ATM — at Dimon's behest — he discovered it was, in fact, faulty. Dimon, in turn, instructed the exec to fire the third-party vendor to whom they'd outsourced monitoring the ATMs. \"Now we track it ourselves,\" he said.And, if your cell phone rings and \"Jamie Dimon\" pops up on Caller ID, it would be advisable to leave the fanciful corporate jargon at the door.\"Regarding communications, avoid management pablum,\" he wrote in the section outlining his leadership strategies and advice. \"It's a pet peeve of mine. Talk like you speak — get rid of the jargon.\"'Morale sucks because we suck'Dimon is known for breaking with his buttoned-up counterparts across the Street when it comes to straight talk, including recently when he launched into an expletive-laced soliloquy to defend the firm's five-days-a-week return-to-office rule.Dimon's pronouncement has been met with resistance inside JPMorgan, where some employees have contemplated unionization and strategized their next moves in private group chats. But this isn't the first time Dimon has remained steadfast in the face of complaints of plunging morale, he said.He recalled visiting a local Bank One branch — one of the firm's roughly 1,800 retail outposts — and realizing that it was open for fewer hours than a rival bank nearby. Quickly, Dimon figured out that the shorter branch hours were actually a companywide issue — one that he was disappointed he didn't catch sooner — and he felt it needed to be corrected.He decided to increase the branches' hours to match competitors, knowing this would likely damage morale.\"I said, 'We've got to change it. We're here for customers,'\" he recalled. \"Obviously, I care about morale — but morale sucks because we suck.

Keep lists. Don't waste time in meetings.These are just some of the management philosophies of Jamie Dimon, the billionaire banker and two-decade veteran CEO of America's biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase, which will report its first-quarter earnings later this week.In his newly released annual letter to shareholders — which the bank published on Monday — Dimon tackled a range of topics, from stagflation to the future of the US democracy. The CEO also outlined some of the \"management tricks and tools\" that have vaulted him to the zenith of Wall Street and corporate America.Among them: Make follow-up lists. Refrain from pulling Dimon aside after a meeting to surreptitiously share grievances. Author your own memorandums and go right to the source when you want answers, even if it means breaking through the chain of command.He reflected on a time when he worked through intermediaries while at Bank One, the firm he ran from 2000 to 2004 before JPMorgan Chase. One day, his wife phoned him to report that one of the firm's ATMs was malfunctioning.Within the walls of the bank, one of the executives Dimon spoke with assured him everything was fine. But when the executive drove out to inspect the ATM — at Dimon's behest — he discovered it was, in fact, faulty. Dimon, in turn, instructed the exec to fire the third-party vendor to whom they'd outsourced monitoring the ATMs. \"Now we track it ourselves,\" he said.And, if your cell phone rings and \"Jamie Dimon\" pops up on Caller ID, it would be advisable to leave the fanciful corporate jargon at the door.\"Regarding communications, avoid management pablum,\" he wrote in the section outlining his leadership strategies and advice. \"It's a pet peeve of mine. Talk like you speak — get rid of the jargon.\"'Morale sucks because we suck'Dimon is known for breaking with his buttoned-up counterparts across the Street when it comes to straight talk, including recently when he launched into an expletive-laced soliloquy to defend the firm's five-days-a-week return-to-office rule.Dimon's pronouncement has been met with resistance inside JPMorgan, where some employees have contemplated unionization and strategized their next moves in private group chats. But this isn't the first time Dimon has remained steadfast in the face of complaints of plunging morale, he said.He recalled visiting a local Bank One branch — one of the firm's roughly 1,800 retail outposts — and realizing that it was open for fewer hours than a rival bank nearby. Quickly, Dimon figured out that the shorter branch hours were actually a companywide issue — one that he was disappointed he didn't catch sooner — and he felt it needed to be corrected.He decided to increase the branches' hours to match competitors, knowing this would likely damage morale.\"I said, 'We've got to change it. We're here for customers,'\" he recalled. \"Obviously, I care about morale — but morale sucks because we suck. Morale will get better when we're better as a company.'\"In yet another lesson, Dimon encouraged leaders to push back against tropes like \"that's the way we've always done it\" to justify misguided decisions. \"It's important for leadership to always question what their company does and why,\" he wrote. The criticism comes amid a company-wide crackdown, led by Dimon, on bureaucracy and inefficiencies.To illustrate his point, Dimon recalled dismissing a battalion of 500 management coaches the firm had been outsourcing.

Consumer payments have become a “new battleground” for banks, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday (April 7) in his annual letter to shareholders. Dimon highlighted the evolving competition from FinTech firms as a key concern for the financial industry. He did so in a shareholder letter covering a broad range of topics, including the recent tariffs, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. The competitive pressures from FinTech companies featured prominently in Dimon’s remarks. He said the emergence of consumer payments as a new battleground is driven by third parties vying for access to banks’ customer data. While stating that JPMorgan Chase has “no problem with data sharing,” Dimon stressed the importance of proper authorization by customers, fair compensation from third parties for accessing banking systems and clear restrictions on data usage. “Banks provide fantastic services, and it’s time to defend ourselves — in the public realm or in court if need be,” Dimon wrote in the letter. Dimon affirmed the bank’s commitment to defending its position in this evolving environment, pointing to JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing significant investments in technology and its ability to compete effectively due to its scale. Dimon’s letter also noted that the U.S. economy has been resilient, fueled by government spending and past stimulus, but also pointed to potential headwinds such as increasing infrastructure and military expenditures that could lead to stickier inflation and higher rates. He identified geopolitical risk as the firm’s “largest risk,” given the ongoing conflicts and tensions globally. Dimon advocated for “comprehensive economic foreign policy to win the new global ‘economic war,’” emphasizing the importance of maintaining alliances and competing effectively with nations like China. He also called for bipartisan commitment to effective domestic policies to drive robust economic growth, addressing issues from education and infrastructure to fiscal and tax policy. Within JPMorgan Chase itself, Dimon emphasized the constant fight against complacency and bureaucracy, detailing management learnings focused on efficiency, accurate accounting and fostering a strong company culture. He reiterated the bank’s commitment to its essential role in communities, supporting economic growth and serving as a source of strength in difficult times. Dimon closed his remarks on the economy in the letter by noting his “abiding faith in America — the exceptional strength of our innovative economy and our resiliency.” The post Jamie Dimon: Consumer Payments ‘New Battleground’ for Banks appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

JPMorgan’s CEO says America’s latest tariffs could dampen an economy that was “already weakening.” In his annual letter to shareholders, published Monday (April 7), Jamie Dimon argues that there are several uncertainties tied to the tariff policy: the effect on confidence, investments, corporate profits and the U.S. dollar, as well as retaliation by other countries. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote. “In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” He added that he is hopeful the tariffs could — in the long-term — benefit the U.S., but said his “most serious concern” is the impact of the situation on the country’s economic relationships. “The United States has had a rather healthy and steady economy for years, although it was already weakening as I began writing this letter — and that was before the recent tariff announcement,” Dimon said. He noted the economy is facing “considerable turbulence” from a number of fronts, including geopolitical issues, inflation, high fiscal deficits, high asset prices and volatility. As forthcoming research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows, Americans’ financial confidence had already been shaken even before last week’s tariff announcement. That research, set to be released next week, finds that most consumers, whether they live paycheck to paycheck or not, are reducing spending, either by buying fewer things or buying cheaper products. This study found consumers already making a connection “between tariffs and the economic pain of persistent inflation and a possible recession, even before the full impact of these policies has hit home — and their wallets,” PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote Monday. These pullbacks, that report added, all came before Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” announcement and the ensuing stock market crash. “So, if consumers do what they say they will do — and have already started to do — with their spending, the simple back-of-the-envelope math predicts a potentially gloomy outcome for the U.S. economy,” Webster wrote. “That’s why many market and economic experts predict slowing economic and anemic GDP growth.” The unease felt by consumers extends into the business world, where, per additional PYMNTS Intelligence research, 32% of middle market companies say that uncertainty will lead them to miss business opportunities due to that uncertainty, 33% faced delays in getting products to market, while 31% experienced client turnover due to their own uncertain business outlooks. “Let that sink in,” Webster added. “That’s roughly a third of U.S. businesses making between $100M to $1B in annual revenue — and the integral bridge between the enterprise and smaller business supply chains — who face some sort of economic uncertainty.” The post JPMorgan CEO: Tariffs Burdening ‘Already Weakening’ US Economy appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

They should also have a leader, a purpose, and a follow-up list, Dimon wrote.He emphasized the importance of reading before a meeting — he said he does it. Dimon also recommended that employees prepare to discuss a new product in a meeting by first writing a press release. This helps them focus and identify questions that may be asked.Once in the meeting, pay attention, he said.\"I see people in meetings all the time who are getting notifications and personal texts or who are reading emails,\" Dimon wrote.The CEO added that there is no need to include people who are not necessary.\"Sometimes we think we're just being nice by inviting people to a meeting who don't have to be there. Sometimes we over-collaborate,\" he wrote.Dimon also repeated his long-held ire with side meetings, in which executives approach him afterward to discuss a matter they didn't want to bring up in front of others.\"That's not acceptable. Don't bother. I'm not their messenger. Lay it on the table in real time,\" he wrote in Monday's letter.In the wide-ranging 58-page letter, Dimon dove into recent tariffs and how they will impact the US, the investment bank's performance, and leadership lessons, including mistakes he has made in his career.Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006, has repeatedly expressed his pet peeves about certain kinds of meetings and how they encourage bureaucracy.In February, in a leaked internal town hall about the importance of in-person work, Dimon aired his frustration with virtual meetings.\"A lot of you were on the fucking Zoom and you were doing the following,\" Dimon said in the recording, \"looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff.\"Clips of the audio recording, which is filled with anecdotes and profanities defending return-to-office, gained millions of views on social media.Zoom meetings are not the only kind Dimon hates.In last year's letter to shareholders, the CEO took aim at companies' Annual General Meetings and complained that they've become places of \"spiraling frivolousness\" and \"showcase of grandstanding\" that need to be reformed.Annual meetings are required for public companies so investors can vote on the board of directors and corporate changes. These meetings range from staid company conferences to splashy events in exotic destinations.

Following a two-day stock sell-off last week, the dreaded \"R\" word has been on everyone's lips. He also suggested that stock market pain may not be over. \"No matter how you measure it, equity valuations are still well above their historical averages,\" he said, adding, \"Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure.\" Dimon's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders comes as the leaders of corporations seek to understand where the economy — and the nation — is headed under Trump, who has bold plans for reorganizing the federal government and US foreign policy. Dimon used his letter to opine on a range of problems facing our nation, as well as potential solutions. \"To be able to attack our problems at home and abroad, we must be strong. And our core strength is based upon our commitment to our values, as well as our ability to work hard and think intelligently about our problems,\" Dimon wrote, adding that he supported both some Democratic and Republican policy positions.The letter also touched on what he deemed \"common sense\" solutions to the nation's problems, including tightening security at the border and doing away with special interests, or what he called \"selfishness on the part of our citizens and elected officials.\"Some Wall Street watchers have long suspected that the billionaire banker — a regular pontificator on world events — has harbored ambitions to seek public office, though he said last year that he would not seek a position in the Trump administration.Dimon bemoaned the increasingly acrimonious tone infecting the public discourse today. Indeed, he lamented, Americans are \"meaner to each other,\" and \"a little more kindness and understanding would go a long way.\"Dimon added: \"I am a firm believer that we should constantly talk with each other, air our views, hold each other accountable and try to respect all sides of an argument.\" He said social media algorithms have amplified the problem.JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion in profit in 2024 and has since called employees back to the office five days a week, and mandate that has led some employees to explore their options, including unionization.In 2024, the bank earned a record $58.5 billion in net income, up from $49.6 billion the year before, it said in earnings filings.

        "description": "\"Despite a sea of red, retail investors stood firm and not only bought the dip but did so at a historic pace,\" JPMorgan said on Thursday. ismagilov/Getty, Yellow duck/Getty, Tyler Le/BIRetail investors poured billions into the market as the S&P 500 tanked Thursday. S&P 500 ETFs and Nvidia were popular buys, while investors sold Tesla shares.A day after individual investors bought $4.7 billion stock, the S&P 500 dropped another 3%. While virtually every market sector crumbled Thursday, retail traders piled into stocks at historic levels — only to face a second day of pain on Friday. Individual investors have consistently bought the dip in stocks this year, but they've mostly been trying to catch a falling knife as the market continues to crumble in response to the uncertainty generated by President Donald Trump's policies. \"The 'buy-the-dip' mentality has only strengthened since 2022, but with mixed subsequent results. In 2022, they have experienced losses more than double those of the market (-54% vs. -18% in S&P),\" JPMorgan said, adding: \"Overall, Retail is down -12.9% YTD compared to 8.3% for the S&P 500.\"\"Buy the dip\" was on full display as the S&P 500 suffered its largest one-day drop since 2020, JPMorgan data shows.\"Despite a sea of red, retail investors stood firm and not only bought the dip but did so at a historic pace. They ended today with +$4.7B of net buying, the largest level over the past decade,\" analysts wrote on Thursday.JPMorganBut if individual investors were hoping Thursday marked the bottom, they were greeted with another red day on Friday. The S&P 500 opened about 3% lower, while the Dow lost almost 1,300 points, and the Nasdaq dropped nearly 4%. The behavior has been on display most of this year. Starting in late February, retail investors plowed historic amounts of cash into stocks. By the end of March, inflows from individual traders totaled $32.9 billion, data from Vanda Research shows. Since then, the S&P 500 is down about 9%. The dip buying on Thursday commenced as the S&P plummeted early in the session, though investors soon turned to sell during a brief intra-day recovery. Retail favorites on Thursday included the usual suspects: $913 million was directed into Nvidia, while S&P 500 ETFs racked up $900 million in inflows.Tesla was the only stock among the Magnificent 7 that saw net selling during the day, JPMorgan said. Stocks are cratering after Trump announced reciprocal tariffs which went beyond what the markets expected. This has sparked fears of a trade war, which could spur inflation and weigh on global economic growth.Read the original article on Business Insider",

In her previous career, she founded Frank, a website that helped students fill out their federal financial aid forms.A jury found on Friday that Javice used fake data to trick JPMorgan, the country's largest bank, into believing her website had gathered the names and other personal data of more than 4 million students. The bank had hoped to market checking accounts and credit cards to these students, but later found that Javice had data for fewer than 300,000 of them.The judge's ankle monitor decision on Tuesday followed some 90 minutes of arguments in federal court in Manhattan — complete with court exhibits showing Javice teaching Pilates.In arguing against the ankle monitor, Javice's lawyer, Ron Sullivan, told the judge that Javice has never missed a day of court and is not a flight risk.Wearing the bulky device once again — as she had for several weeks before a November decision granting its removal — would be a severe impediment to her career as a Pilates instructor, Sullivan said.\"To have your legs in the air and the monitor going up and down on your leg — it is a significant encumbrance,\" Sullivan told the judge. The lawyer held both arms aloft and waved them back and forth to demonstrate as he stood at a podium.While wearing an ankle bracelet previously, she was only able to teach lessons briefly, and for family and friends, Sullivan said.Her classes require \"demanding physical movement and full flexibility and range of motion, specifically around her feet and ankles,\" her lawyers argued in court filings earlier Tuesday.\"Ms. Javice's services are sought after because her instruction is particularly challenging and dynamic,\" the filing said.In Hellerstein's courtroom, an assistant US attorney countered that an ankle bracelet is necessary now that Javice, who holds dual French-US citizenship, has been convicted.\"We would be well within our rights to seek remand,\" said the prosecutor, Georgia V. Kostopoulos.\"And we understand that pretrial services would not be opposed to that,\" she said, referring to the agency that handles post-conviction supervision.France does not have an extradition agreement with the United States, prosecutors have said.Hellerstein said that he had examined a GPS ankle monitor earlier in the day.\"It's not heavy. It probably weighs a pound,\" he told the prosecutors and defense lawyers.\"So I don't know,\" he said. \"I accept what you say, that it's a restriction on her ability to do the advanced Pilates that she does.\"Still, he added, \"I can't say there is no risk of flight.\" He briefly retreated to chambers — holding printouts of photos of Javice teaching — to think it over before deciding.The judge also required Javice's codefendant, Olivier Amar, to wear an ankle monitor. As with Javice, Amar's lawyers — who'd argued that a monitor \"is quite large\" and \"makes him a pariah\" — were invited to pitch the judge an alternate bail package.Amar is free on a $1 million bond.

        "description": "From JPMorgan to the everyday American, here's how Mastercard wants to build the payments network of the future. Mastercard is building its next-generation payments network on blockchain.Getty/Hannah Smith/ESPAT MediaMastercard is building out its blockchain and crypto capabilities for consumers and finance firms.Recent regulatory shifts and Wall Street warming up to the space have given the industry momentum.Mastercard's blockchain leader walks us through his playbook for seizing the moment.As political tailwinds lift the crypto industry, Mastercard hopes to cash in on a bet it started years ago.The payments giant is looking to replicate its massive card network for the blockchain world to create a way for consumers, merchants, and financial institutions to transact digital assets. Doing so will require engineering leg work, regulatory support, key partnerships, and getting Wall Street buy-in. It would also insert Mastercard as a critical digital-asset infrastructure provider for the growing industry, creating a competitive moat similar to what it has built in the payments space over the past 60 years.\"We bring the scale and reach that we have to the space for the money to flow between the two worlds in a simple way,\" Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets, said of traditional finance and decentralized finance.\"What is missing in this is a fully compliant framework and consumer experience offered on chain, like how you do Venmo and Zelle today in the US domestically,\" he added.Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets.MastercardBringing a Venmo-like experience to moving money and other assets via blockchain won't be easy, and financial institution adoption will be critical. As with any network, the value of the network increases as more users join. Mastercard, for its part, is targeting banks to join its crypto-focused network, the Multi-Token Network, to expand its functionality. So far, Mastercard has made in-roads with JPMorgan and Standard Chartered to develop new use cases, like cross-border payments and tokenizing deposits and carbon credits.\"Some of the players in the traditional financial world are interested in moving into this base because of the benefits the technology offers and the new business models it can create,\" Dhamodharan said.A two-pronged crypto playbookFor consumers, the payments giant wants to enable its 3.5 billion cardholders worldwide to move money and transact between the fiat and crypto worlds. Mastercard has introduced more than 100 different crypto-focused card programs globally, such as credit cards, prepaid cards, and rewards cards, where users get crypto instead of cashback.\"This flow of capital and spending power from the consumer side is essential to the success of this entire sector,\" Dhamodharan said.Traditional Wall Street firms represent another opportunity for Mastercard, especially as real-world assets increasingly become tokenized or represented digitally on blockchain. Dhamodharan said he wants to provide a way to process blockchain-based transactions for trade finance and cross-border payments.Digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokenized assets, require a different set of back-end tooling than traditional assets. Digital assets use a decentralized, public ledger that sits across a network rather than the centralized private ledger most banks use to keep track of money movement.Historically, this infrastructure disconnect and regulatory uncertainty made it tricky for traditional financial firms to access crypto, which presented business opportunities in custody, trading, and wealth management. For banks and asset managers, crypto offered some upside in round-the-clock transaction settlements, simplifying the escrow process for home buyers and streamlining money movements between accounts.\"Mastercard has made a sizable bet on this,\" Dhamodharan said of Mastercard's research and development and startup-focused efforts.Since 2015, the payments firm has filed more than 250 unique patents related to blockchain and digital-asset technology, an effort that involves filing and maintenance fees and employing specialized legal and R&D teams. It also has supported 43 blockchain startups since 2021 through its startup accelerator program. While the firm declined to share how much its digital-asset team has grown over the years, it is growing. Mastercard has eight open roles, some fetching as much as $348,000 in annual pay, geared to blockchain across software engineering, product, legal, and regulatory disciplines.Building the next foundationMastercard's multi-token network, which launched in 2023 and is the foundation of its strategy, will enable financial institutions to access and build on the chain.A November 2024 integration with JPMorgan's blockchain business unit improved the speed of settling cross-border transactions by making it available 24/7, streamlining a process that typically takes days to coordinate across time zones. Last year Mastercard also worked with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong to test paying for carbon credits in a tokenized form. A February partnership with Ondo Finance, a fintech that tokenizes money market funds and treasuries on-chain, is helping Mastercard to make institutional financial assets available digitally.It's a fast-moving and dynamic time to be in crypto, Dhamodharan said. That's a change of pace from the retreat the industry saw in 2022, when a few high-profile crypto blowups — like the stunning collapse of trading platform FTX, the wipeout of the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, and the fallout of the overleveraged hedge fund Three Arrows Capital — threw cold water on the industry.Tailwinds are coming from Washington, DC in the form of regulatory clarity, the lack of which largely held back traditional financial institutions from going all in on crypto. Regulators under the new administration are paving the way for crypto players, from the SEC to the OCC. The crypto ecosystem has been busy building more public blockchains, developing more protocols to run on those chains, and tokenizing more assets to be traded on-chain, Dhamodharan said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Startup founder Charlie Javice has been convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase by misleading the bank about her customer base. A federal jury in Manhattan on Friday (March 28) found Javice — founder of student financial aid platform Frank — and fellow executive Olivier Amar guilty of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. The verdict followed a nearly month-long trial against the pair, who had been accused of inflating Frank’s customer base to secure a $175 million acquisition by JPMorgan. The prosecution had argued that Javice and Amar had paid a data scientist to make it appear that Frank had 10 times as many customers as it really did. Based on those numbers, JPMorgan agreed to purchase Frank, in hopes of cross-selling banking products to what it thought would be millions of users. In reality, Frank had only around 300,000 customers. Javice was charged with fraud in April 2023. She and Amar now face decades in prison, the WSJ report said. Months earlier, JPMorgan had sued Javice for fraud. According to WSJ, Javice is likely to appeal her conviction. Her attorneys have spent weeks arguing that the trial was improper because Amar’s lawyers have been functioning as a “second prosecutor” against their client. The report also noted that the trial had highlighted failures in the JPMorgan due diligence process. Prosecutors had shown evidence that — while in talks with the bank — Javice had helped develop a dataset to show that her company had millions of users. Frank’s head of engineering testified in court that Javice had tried to enlist him to create the list, a request which he refused. Javice then hired a mathematics professor, paying him $18,000 to create a synthetic data file of 4 million fake customers. The WSJ report said this field was turned over to a third-party company that essentially counted the number of data fields and told JPMorgan that it showed Javice had 4 million customers. Bank executives who were involved in the acquisition said the deal relied chiefly on Javice’s statements to them, although some employees at JPMorgan had flagged concerns about her data. According to court testimony, when the bank attempted to market its services to Frank customers based on the company’s data, only 28% of the emails were delivered successfully.

        "description": "A verdict returned a verdict in the trial of Charlie Javice.Mike Segar/ReutersA federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase.Prosecutors said she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech startup had data for 4.25M students.Javice risks a possible maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison.A federal jury in Manhattan has convicted Frank founder Charlie Javice of four counts of defrauding JPMorgan Chase.It took jurors 8 hours of deliberations over two days to reach Friday's verdict: the finding that during six weeks of testimony, prosecutors proved Javice used fake data to trick the world's largest bank into buying her startup for $175 million.The maximum sentence for the charges is 30 years in prison.The verdict is the latest chapter in a spectacular fall from grace for the once-promising microfinance entrepreneur.Javice was 27 years old in the summer of 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.She was at the height of her success. She had been featured in Forbes' 30 under 30 in 2019, and had attracted tens of millions of dollars in private equity funding.Aleph's Michael Eisenberg and Apollo's Marc Rowan were early investors and board members. During negotiations, she met one-on-one for 30 minutes with CEO Jamie Dimon.\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" her lead attorney, Baez told jurors in opening statements.The bank's main goal in acquiring Frank, the defense lawyer argued, was to hire this rising fintech star as managing director in charge of student solutions — and to keep her and the website out of the hands of the competition.\"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for,\" Baez told jurors. \"And that's what they got.\"Prosecutors countered that the only real draw was Javice's data.Frank gave students a simplified platform for filling out their FAFSA forms — the Free Application for Federal Student Aid — making it a treasure trove of student data and of great interest to banks.Visitors would create an account and begin entering their financial and identifying information. The Frank site boasted that it used these inputs to generate a completed FAFSA in seven minutes, far more quickly than the average 13 hours the forms otherwise took to complete.According to trial testimony, by the time the Frank-JPMorgan merger closed after months of negotiations, just under 300,000 visitors had signed up for a Frank account and, as part of beginning a FAFSA, had shared their first name, last name, email address, and phone number.Prosecutors said Javice fraudulently enticed JPMorgan to pay $175 million for the website by wildly inflating that 300,000 figure.The pair consistently assured JPMorgan \"that Frank had over 4 million users and that a user was someone who'd started an account by providing their first name, last name, phone number, and email,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments.\"Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar sold Frank for $175 million worth of lies,\" the prosecutor, Nicholas Chiuchiolo told them on Wednesday.\"Frank's 4 million customers — they were made up,\" Chiuchilo said. \"Literally made up by a computer program. They did not exist. And through their lies Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar became multimillionaires.\"The bank purchased Frank in order to market financial products — Chase checking accounts, credit cards, auto loans, and the like — directly to these 4 million students.Lawyers for Javice and Amar countered that they'd made it clear to the bank that when they referred to their 4 million users, they meant these were merely the number of website visitors.They also argued that the distinction didn't actually matter. The bank never cared how many visitors or student emails Frank had, the defense argued. It cared so little, in fact, that during months of negotiations — as all sides in the case agree — its executives never bothered to verify if the 4 million users Frank was claiming were real.Multiple government witnesses, including then-Chase CFO Sarah Youngwood — now the CFO of Nasdaq — told jurors a different story.They testified that what JPMorgan really wanted from the purchase were those millions of rows of student contact information, which the bank could use to pitch Chase accounts to young people at the start of their financial journeys.Leslie Wims Morris was the JPMorgan corporate development head who led the bank's Frank acquisition team. She told jurors that the bank relied on trust, not verification.She also told jurors there's no way JPMorgan would have even looked at Frank if the bank knew that Javice only had the names and personal identifying information for fewer than 300,000 students.Baez mocked Wims Morris in Wednesday's closings, noting that since the deal with Frank went south, she's now CEO of Chase Auto.\"I think her biggest client is Frank's Auto Lot,\" the Javice's lawyer joked to jurors.This is a breaking story.

During negotiations, she met one-on-one for 30 minutes with CEO Jamie Dimon.\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" her lead attorney, Baez told jurors in opening statements.The bank's main goal in acquiring Frank, the defense lawyer argued, was to hire this rising fintech star as managing director in charge of student solutions — and to keep her and the website out of the hands of the competition.\"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for,\" Baez told jurors. \"And that's what they got.\"Prosecutors countered that the only real draw was Javice's data.Frank gave students a simplified platform for filling out their FAFSA forms — the Free Application for Federal Student Aid — making it a treasure trove of student data and of great interest to banks.Visitors would create an account and begin entering their financial and identifying information. The Frank site boasted that it used these inputs to generate a completed FAFSA in seven minutes, far more quickly than the average 13 hours the forms otherwise took to complete.According to trial testimony, by the time the Frank-JPMorgan merger closed after months of negotiations, just under 300,000 visitors had signed up for a Frank account and, as part of beginning a FAFSA, had shared their first name, last name, email address, and phone number.Prosecutors said Javice fraudulently enticed JPMorgan to pay $175 million for the website by wildly inflating that 300,000 figure.The pair consistently assured JPMorgan \"that Frank had over 4 million users and that a user was someone who'd started an account by providing their first name, last name, phone number, and email,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments.\"Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar sold Frank for $175 million worth of lies,\" the prosecutor, Nicholas Chiuchiolo told them on Wednesday.\"Frank's 4 million customers — they were made up,\" Chiuchilo said. \"Literally made up by a computer program. They did not exist. And through their lies Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar became multimillionaires.\"The bank purchased Frank in order to market financial products — Chase checking accounts, credit cards, auto loans, and the like — directly to these 4 million students.Lawyers for Javice and Amar countered that they'd made it clear to the bank that when they referred to their 4 million users, they meant these were merely the number of website visitors.They also argued that the distinction didn't actually matter. The bank never cared how many visitors or student emails Frank had, the defense argued. It cared so little, in fact, that during months of negotiations — as all sides in the case agree — its executives never bothered to verify if the 4 million users Frank was claiming were real.Multiple government witnesses, including then-Chase CFO Sarah Youngwood — now the CFO of Nasdaq — told jurors a different story.They testified that what JPMorgan really wanted from the purchase were those millions of rows of student contact information, which the bank could use to pitch Chase accounts to young people at the start of their financial journeys.Leslie Wims Morris was the JPMorgan corporate development head who led the bank's Frank acquisition team. She told jurors that the bank relied on trust, not verification.She also told jurors there's no way JPMorgan would have even looked at Frank if the bank knew that Javice only had the names and personal identifying information for fewer than 300,000 students.Baez mocked Wims Morris in Wednesday's closings, noting that since the deal with Frank went south, she's now CEO of Chase Auto.\"I think her biggest client is Frank's Auto Lot,\" the Javice's lawyer joked to jurors.This is a breaking",

        "description": "IPO will mean more revenue pressure and possibly more ads. As previously rumored, Discord, a popular communications platform, is working with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to plan an IPO as soon as this year, according to a recent report by Bloomberg. The report cites people familiar with the matter and notes that more advisors may come on board as the talks progress. This isn't the first we've heard about plans for an IPO; an article in The New York Times claimed that Discord had begun exploratory meetings with bankers earlier this month. Even way back in 2022, Discord was exploring the option of a direct listing, but it now seems the company plans to go with a traditional IPO. Launched in 2015, Discord was initially conceived as an improved way to facilitate communication while playing video games—and gaming-related uses still account for more than 90 percent of its activity. While some previous tools focused mainly on in-game voice chat, Discord supports text, voice, and video, as well as game streaming. It also has robust features for managing communities outside the game and has developer APIs for developing bots, tools, and games that can be used within its channels.Read full article Comments",

Most auto stocks moved lower on Thursday in reaction to the tariffs, with various automakers expected to be negatively affected by the higher prices.The tariffs don't take effect until April 3, and there's a chance negotiations result in changes to the final rate or a narrowing of the scope. But investors are shooting first and asking questions later. That's because the tariffs if fully enacted, could cost automakers tens of billions of dollars.Of the roughly 16 million cars sold in America each year, about half are manufactured outside in other countries, and nearly all of them rely on foreign-made auto parts, which are also subject to the new tariffs.JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman called the tariffs \"draconian\" in a note on Thursday and lowered his price targets for General Motors, Ford, and Ferrari as a result.\"We are lowering our price targets for shares of General Motors, Ford, and Ferrari given the increased potential for material earnings risk from draconian auto tariffs that now seem likelier than ever to be imposed as soon as April 3,\" Brinkman said.Brinkman estimates that the new tariffs could cost the auto industry $82 billion, double his prior estimate of $41 billion.Here are the biggest losers from the Trump auto tariffs, based on Thursday's price action.General MotorsGeneral Motors stock declined about 7% on Thursday, after dropping 3% on Wednesday. The company relies heavily on manufacturing its vehicles in Canada and Mexico.Markets InsiderFordWhile Ford is better insulated from the tariffs than General Motors thanks to its domestic manufacturing plants, it still stands to take a sizable earnings hit, ranging from $2 billion to $4.5 billion, according to JPMorgan.

        "description": "President Donald Trump's auto tariffs are set to take effect next week. Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTrump's auto tariffs have landed — and they may have a major impact on car prices.JP Morgan analysts say 25% tariffs on cars from Mexico and Canada could push up prices by as much as $2,500.Auto stocks fell on fears the tariffs will impact the global automotive industry.After several false starts, Trump's auto tariffs are finally here — and they could make buying a new car a lot more expensive.The announcement of the 25% tariffs on all imported passenger vehicles and key car parts, which take effect on April 2, sent foreign and domestic auto stocks tumbling.Analysts have long warned that the levies are likely to push up car prices as the US automotive industry scrambles to respond.Wedbush analysts said in a Wednesday note that the tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5k to $10k depending on the make/ model/price point.\"Analysis from Anderson Economic Group reported by CNBC put the potential price hike from Trump's levies at between $4,000 and $12,200 depending on the vehicle. EVs are likely to be hit hard due to their imported batteries and electronics.Prior to Trump announcing a 30-day exemption for the auto industry earlier this month, JP Morgan analysts estimated that 25% tariffs on vehicle imports from Mexico and Canada alone could raise the average price of new vehicles by as much as $2,580.Automakers are also sounding the alarm. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major US automakers including GM and Ford, warned earlier this month that proposed import taxes could see car prices rise by as much as 25%.GM and Ford, as well as foreign rivals such as Toyota, Nissan, and BMW, all have major production facilities in Mexico, meaning they are likely to be badly affected by the tariffs.Barclays analysts warned earlier this month that 25% levies on auto imports from Mexico and Canada could effectively wipe out profits for Ford, GM, and Stellantis.Automakers like Tesla that build most of their cars in the US will feel the pain too, with the tariffs extending to automobile parts including engines, powertrain parts, and \"electrical components.\"Despite building their cars in the US, the likes of Tesla still source many of their components abroad.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTrump's auto tariffs have landed — and they may have a major impact on car prices.JP Morgan analysts say 25% tariffs on cars from Mexico and Canada could push up prices by as much as $2,500.Auto stocks fell on fears the tariffs will impact the global automotive industry.After several false starts, Trump's auto tariffs are finally here — and they could make buying a new car a lot more expensive.The announcement of the 25% tariffs on all imported passenger vehicles and key car parts, which take effect on April 2, sent foreign and domestic auto stocks tumbling.Analysts have long warned that the levies are likely to push up car prices as the US automotive industry scrambles to respond.Wedbush analysts said in a Wednesday note that the tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5k to $10k depending on the make/ model/price point.\"Analysis from Anderson Economic Group reported by CNBC put the potential price hike from Trump's levies at between $4,000 and $12,200 depending on the vehicle. EVs are likely to be hit hard due to their imported batteries and electronics.Prior to Trump announcing a 30-day exemption for the auto industry earlier this month, JP Morgan analysts estimated that 25% tariffs on vehicle imports from Mexico and Canada alone could raise the average price of new vehicles by as much as $2,580.Automakers are also sounding the alarm. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major US automakers including GM and Ford, warned earlier this month that proposed import taxes could see car prices rise by as much as 25%.GM and Ford, as well as foreign rivals such as Toyota, Nissan, and BMW, all have major production facilities in Mexico, meaning they are likely to be badly affected by the tariffs.Barclays analysts warned earlier this month that 25% levies on auto imports from Mexico and Canada could effectively wipe out profits for Ford, GM, and Stellantis.Automakers like Tesla that build most of their cars in the US will feel the pain too, with the tariffs extending to automobile parts including engines, powertrain parts, and \"electrical components.\"Despite building their cars in the US, the likes of Tesla still source many of their components abroad. Between 20% and 25% of the components from Tesla's 2025 model-year vehicles come from Mexico, according to regulatory filings.Global pain Shares in foreign automakers fell following the announcement of the tariffs, with Nissan, Toyota, and Honda down between 1.5% to 3.5%.In Europe, BMW and Volkswagen fell slightly in morning trading, while Mercedes stock dipped 2% drop.Economists have previously warned that increasing the tariff of cars imported from Europe to the US to 25% from the current 2.5% would lead to a sharp fall in the number of cars shipped across the Atlantic.A January report from Oxford Economics estimated that automotive exports from Germany and Italy would decline by 7.1% and 6.6% respectively due to the tariffs.

These users were students at the start of their financial journeys, to whom JPMorgan could market checking accounts and credit cards.In five weeks of testimony, lawyers for Javice have sought to show that this is not what she had meant by users at all.Instead, her lawyers say, she told the bank that 4 million people had merely visited the website and clicked around a bit, a number supported by Google Analytics.Frank only ever collected personal identifying data for 300,000 account holders, not 4 million, both sides agree — a fact the bank says they only discovered months after the merger.So a central dispute in front of jurors — as they listen to closing arguments by attorneys for the government, for Javice, and for her top lieutenant-turned-co-defendant Olivier Amar — will be this: How did Javice, 32, and Amar, 50, define \"user\" in negotiations with JPMorgan?

Affirm is expanding its pay-later offering via a new agreement with J.P. Morgan Payments. With this partnership, announced Tuesday (March 25), Affirm’s solutions become available to merchants on the J.P. Morgan Payments network in the U.S., letting them offer the company’s buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans at checkout. According to the companies’ announcement, the collaboration is happening amid increased adoption of Affirm’s services, with its active customer numbers reaching a record 21 million, up 23% year over year. “The demand for diverse payment options, flexibility, and seamless transactions from both merchants and their customers is at an all-time high,” said Michael Lozanoff, global head of merchant services at J.P. Morgan Payments. “By incorporating Affirm as a payment method into our Commerce Platform, we are empowering businesses to deliver the services they need and the experiences that customers increasingly expect as part of their retail journey,” he added. The partnership comes nearly a week after Affirm announced it would begin furnishing information about all of its payment plans to Experian starting April 1. “Having all loans reflected in a consumer’s financial profile will help protect and empower borrowers,” Libor Michalek, Affirm president, said in a Wednesday (March 19) news release. ”The buy now, pay later industry must evolve from simply providing flexible payment options to helping consumers build their credit histories and better manage their finances, and we are pleased to be taking this step with Experian,” Michalek said. The company said this expanded credit reporting will help consumers build their credit histories, while letting consumers and lenders make more informed decisions. As PYMNTS wrote soon after, Affirm’s decision here is part of a growing movement toward including BNPL loans in credit and underwriting decisions. In February, FICO said it would work to add BNPL data to its credit scoring analysis. That company had teamed with Affirm on studies showing that — for the 85% of consumers who had opened a new BNPL account — there was generally a consistent impact on their FICO scores. That research also found that impacts on FICO Score predictiveness ranged modest improvements to no negative effect. “The additional impact of having BNPL included in credit scoring may be that consumers will be averse to “stacking” short-term loans, with an eye on keeping their debt loads more manageable and boosting their credit scores at the same time,” PYMNTS wrote.

JPMorgan Chase and Walmart reportedly partnered on an embedded finance solution that lets merchants selling products through the retailer’s marketplace platform accept and make payments and manage their cash flow. This offering is now available for U.S. merchants, but it may be expanded to Europe and other regions, Reuters reported Monday (March 24), citing its interview with Lia Cao, head of embedded finance and solutions at JPMorgan Chase. Cao said in the report that JPMorgan Chase now has embedded finance partnerships with more than 20 clients and expects that number to double over the next year, according to the report. New embedded finance solutions enable the direct integration of banking and credit products into retail platforms, presenting the opportunity for new revenue streams, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Carat from Fiserv collaboration, “Business Platform Survey: Why Embedded Finance is the Next Big Bet.” The report found that 74% of marketplaces find embedded finance features highly important to their innovation strategies. Embedded finance can create an ecosystem in which trust, sales conversions and seamless B2B integrations are front and center, PYMNTS found when interviewing nine industry experts for the series, “What’s Next in Payments: Embedded Everything: Priority One for Financial Services in 2025.” For merchants, embedded finance can smooth the checkout process and enable seamless transactions. Walmart made some other additions to its marketplace in August, adding new product categories, omnichannel experiences and fulfillment solutions. The retailer said at the time that Walmart Marketplace had achieved more than 30% sales growth in each of the previous four quarters and that the number of sellers listing items on Walmart.com grew 20% in the previous fiscal year. “We know the importance of personalized, seamless omnichannel experiences, and Walmart continues to advance its digital and fulfillment capabilities, including the new categories and features we announced today, that enhance the overall customer and seller experience on Walmart.com,” Tom Ward, who was executive vice president and chief eCommerce officer, Walmart U.S., at the time, said in an Aug. 27 press release. Walmart launched its third-party marketplace in 2009 to diversify its product offerings and compete with Amazon’s seller ecosystem.

        "description": "At her $175M fraud trial this week, Charlie Javice's defense lawyers will tell a jury JPMorgan misunderstood two things: her data and Gen Z. Charlie Javice outside federal court in Manhattan.Mike Segar/ReutersClosing arguments are set for Wednesday in the NY fraud trial of Frank founder Charlie Javice.Federal prosecutors say Javice tricked JPMorgan Chase into paying $175 million for her website.Her lawyers say JPMC got what it wanted in the deal — Javice herself — then fumbled the ball.Four years ago, when Charlie Javice began boasting that Frank, her financial aid website, had more than 4 million student users, eyebrows shot up among her co-workers.\"Do we really have 4.25M students?\" they chatted behind her back on the office messaging app, Slack, during a team meeting in early 2021. \"Is this real?\" one slacked, according to government evidence. \"Why do I feel like it's so much smaller?\"When a Frank worker joked, \"These look like charlie numbers,\" another agreed: \"Charlie is king of finding magic numbers haha.\"As early as Thursday, a federal jury in Manhattan will begin weighing fraud and conspiracy charges that carry a potential 30-year prison sentence. The charges allege that Javice, 32, and her top executive at Frank, Olivier Amar, 50, used fake data to trick JPMorgan Chase into buying the website for $175 million.Jurors will be asked to consider many millions of numbers scattered throughout spreadsheets, emails, WhatsApp texts, and Slack messages surrounding the 2021 deal.Ultimately, though, a single \"Charlie number\" — and whether it was magic or merely misunderstood — will be at the center of their deliberations.That number is 4,265,085.Prosecutors say it's what Javice ultimately settled on when, on July 8, 2021, she told JPMorgan executives how many individuals had used the website over the previous four years to at least begin filling out a FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid.Javice assured JPMorgan that each of these users had given Frank their first name, last name, email, and phone number, prosecutors said. They said she also told the bank that many of them had additionally given Frank their Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and details on their income, cash assets, and investments.All of this information could be theirs if they purchased Frank, the bank was told — data points it could use to directly market Chase credit cards and checking accounts to students at the start of their lifelong financial journeys.A slide from a 60-page pitch deck Frank founder Charlie Javice sent to JPMorgan Chase during 2021 merger negotiations says, \"4.25 million Students trust Frank for all their money needs.\"US Attorney's Office/Business InsiderProsecutors allege that when the bank asked to verify the impressive number, Javice pushed back, citing user privacy and terms-of-service restrictions.During daylong meetings on July 12 and 13, 2021, Javice repeatedly assured the bank that the number represented real Frank users from whom the website had collected at least names, emails, and phone numbers.JPMorgan Chase kept pressing for proof.So Javice and the bank agreed to a compromise — she would send her 4,265,085 rows of spreadsheet data to a third-party marketing company. The marketing company could review the spreadsheet and assure the bank that the data was all there.The trouble, prosecutors allege, was that no such spreadsheet existed. They say that only 293,000 users had ever signed up for a Frank account and submitted their names, emails, and phone numbers to the website. Many of these account holders had never started a FAFSA.Eager to clinch the deal, Javice and Amar were undaunted, prosecutors argued.According to the indictment against them, the two hired an outside company to create a phony spreadsheet whose 4,265,085 rows would mirror the statistical properties of those 293,000 actual users.Federal prosecutors allege this chart is filled with bogus numbers and was sent by Javice to JPMorgan Chase to help convince the bank to buy her website.US Attorney's Office/Business InsiderProsecutors say this massive Excel spreadsheet was created by an outside company in three days for $18,000 and filled with \"synthetic data\" to clinch the $175 million sale.\"It was all fake,\" federal prosecutor Micah Festa Fergenson said during Javice's arraignment in April.The parties signed a merger agreement in early August 2021. The deal closed a month later. Javice received an immediate $21 million and began collecting on her half-million-dollar annual salary and bonus package.As Javice courted potential buyers for Frank, the financial aid website boasted of its 4.25 million student users.US Attorney's Office/Business InsiderJPMorgan, the country's largest bank, purchased Frank without ever setting eyes on the spreadsheet, nevermind vetting its numbers.Instead, prosecutors allege, the bank relied on Javice's third-party marketing company, which assured that it had counted the rows of data, and, indeed, they numbered 4,265,085.After the merger closed, Javice and Amar knew their new bosses would need real numbers so, prosecutors say, they purchased publicly-available data for four million students, including names, emails, and phone numbers, on the open market for $100,000.When Chase used the data to test-run a marketing campaign, \"a lot of the emails were old and didn't work,\" Fergenson, the prosecutor, said at Javice's arraignment. \"Almost nobody clicked through to it. And it was completely unexpected.\"A former Frank employee testified Thursday that more than 30% of the emails were invalid. She said only 1% of the people who received the Chase email actually clicked to open it.Ultimately, the test run using Frank's user spreadsheet — the spreadsheet JPMorgan spent $175 million to access — resulted in 10 people signing up for a Chase checking account.The bank launched an in-house investigation. The Frank website was taken down. JPMorgan fired Javice and Amar in November 2022 and sued them a month later.The following April, the US Attorney's Office announced Javice's indictment. On the same day, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had filed a civil lawsuit charging her with bank and securities fraud, a case that remains on hold pending the resolution of her criminal case.Javice arrives at federal court in Manhattan.INSIDERThey wanted Javice more than her dataIn court papers, opening statements, and arguments throughout a monthlong trial, Javice's attorneys have tipped their hand on several defenses that may find their way into closing arguments scheduled for Wednesday.They've argued that for JPMorgan, the Frank deal was more about acquiring Javice — a promising fintech star and media darling — than her data.The microfinance entrepreneur had made Forbes' \"30 under 30\" list and, at age 28, secured a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO.JPMorgan hired Javice as its managing director for student solutions because she was an \"incredible young woman,\" defense lawyer Jose Baez said during opening statements last month.\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" Baez, the Florida attorney who successfully defended Casey Anthony, told jurors. \"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for, and that's what they got.\"The defense lawyers have also argued that Javice could not have intended to deceive JPMorgan because previous to the merger negotiations, she'd repeatedly said in interviews and on the pages of Frank that the website had helped 300,000 students and their families.And they've argued that when Javice cited that 4-million-user figure, JPMorgan executives misunderstood her.\"The 4.25 million figure was about website traffic based on Google Analytics metrics,\" her lawyer Kirsten Nelson said in a court filing earlier this month.Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan testified on Thursday on behalf of Javice that terms like \"user,\" \"customer,\" and \"visitor\" were generally synonymous.\"A user could casually come and go and absorb Frank content without significant interaction,\" Rowan, an early Frank investor and board member, said of the millions who had clicked around the website.Finally, the defense may argue, as they have in court papers, that the bank concocted fraud allegations to fire Javice \"for cause\" and avoid paying her a $20 million retention bonus.The defense may argue that JPMorgan killed Frank after an email-blast marketing campaign that failed not because of fraud but because JPMorgan Chase was tone-deaf to Gen Z.Young people rarely answer emails, Javice witness Jennifer Zeitler, a former Frank marketing manager, told jurors on Thursday. The bank would have had better luck sending out texts instead, she told the jury on Thursday.\"Ninety-nine percent of text messages are read,\" she testified. Instead, \"We were just spamming people.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "JPMorgan Chase has long publicly championed diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. Going forward, however, the bank will be embracing the term “opportunity” in lieu of “equity.” On Friday, the bank announced a notable change to the name of its DEI program. “We are changing ‘equity’ to ‘opportunity’ and renaming our organization to Diversity, Opportunity & Inclusion (DOI) because the ‘e’ always meant equal opportunity to us, not equal outcomes, and we believe this more accurately reflects our ongoing approach to reach the most customers and clients to grow our business, create an inclusive workplace for our employees and increase access to opportunities,” chief operating officer Jenn Piepzak explained in a memo obtained by Reuters. The memo also outlined a number of changes, from cutting back on trainings to embedding certain diversity programs into other departments like Human Resources. In what seemed to be a reference to President Trump’s recent executive orders targeting corporate DEI programs, Piepzak reiterated JPMorgan’s commitment to merit-based practices. (When reached for comment, a JPMorgan spokesperson shared the full text of the memo and noted that the company had started making these changes following the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action in 2023.) “We’ve always been committed to hiring, compensation and promotion that are merit-based; we do not have illegal quotas or pay incentives, and we would never turn someone away because of their political or religious beliefs, or because of who they are,” Piepzak said in the memo. “We’re not perfect, but we take pride in constantly challenging ourselves and raising the bar.” As the Trump administration has fixed its sights on DEI efforts in the private sector, leading finance companies have reevaluated their language on diversity. According to a recent report by Gravity Research, the risk of DEI-related litigation has been of particular concern to finance executives, and the Wall Street Journal reported last month that many banks (among them JPMorgan) were auditing their diversity programs and planning to adjust their public language on DEI in upcoming regulatory filings. In February, Citigroup—which also happens to be the only major bank with a female CEO—retreated from some of its diversity goals and renamed its DEI team. Even prior to the latest change at JPMorgan, its outspoken CEO Jamie Dimon had made several comments about the company’s DEI programs in recent months. Speaking at an internal town hall last month, Dimon said he was “never a firm believer in bias training,” seemingly a reference to unconscious bias trainings (which have been criticized as ineffective). Dimon also claimed that the company had overspent on certain DEI initiatives. “I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid shit, and it really pissed me off,” Dimon said, according to a Bloomberg report. “I’m just gonna cancel them. I don’t like wasted money in bureaucracy.” All the while, however, Dimon has continued to preach support for diversity programs and underscored JPMorgan’s commitment to diversity and inclusion work. “We’re still going to reach out to the Black, Hispanic, LGBT, veteran, [and] disabled communities—we’re not changing that,” he said in a subsequent CNBC interview. “But if we did something wrong with DEI, we’re going to fix it. I never had a problem admitting that we did too much and we need to change something.”",

Our efforts to maximize value for investors and uplift the people and communities we serve drive our passion and dedication — and make us a stronger, more successful company.We regularly review all of our products and services to be effective and efficient and to keep up with the market, consumer demand and current laws and regulations as they evolve, and we're doing the same regarding our diversity efforts, where we're making some changes to our programs and the language we use to describe them.Specifically:We are changing \"equity\" to \"opportunity\" and renaming our organization to Diversity, Opportunity & Inclusion (DOI) because the \"e\" always meant equal opportunity to us, not equal outcomes, and we believe this more accurately reflects our ongoing approach to reach the most customers and clients to grow our business, create an inclusive workplace for our employees and increase access to opportunities. The DOI organization will continue to report to Thelma Ferguson.We've already streamlined our diversity programs that were managed centrally by the DOI organization which meant some programs that formerly sat in DOI are now integrated into the lines of business, Human Resources or Corporate Responsibility.Our employee groups will continue to focus on engagement, cultural celebrations, education and historical observances, and be available for all. We're increasing connectivity between Councils, Executive Forums, Business Resource Groups, and the Diversity, Opportunity & Inclusion organization to ensure consistent operating principles and maximum impact. This means some activities, councils or chapters may be consolidated to streamline our process and engagement strategy.Additionally, we plan to reduce trainings while maintaining a focus on high quality offerings.We will continuously evaluate programs across every part of our business to make sure they make commercial sense and are driving the right business outcomes. We must constantly raise the bar on how we deliver impact if we're to remain a strong business and employer of choice. And we will continue to comply with all laws and regulations.We remain committed to our core principles, which includes our belief in the power of a diverse workforce that strengthens our business and attracts and retains the best talent.

Getty Images; Emojipedia; Rebecca Zisser/BIRetail investors bought $7.3 billion in Tesla stock over the past two weeks, JPMorgan said.The buying behavior signals that retail investors are in \"buy the dip\" mode as Tesla stock plunges.While retail investors are buying, Tesla insiders have sold huge amounts of stock. Retail investors can't get enough of Tesla, even as the stock undergoes a 50% haircut.Data from JPMorgan shows that net retail buying of the stock was positive for 12 consecutive days, totaling $7.3 billion.\"While this is not the longest consecutive streak of Retail buying in TSLA, it is the highest magnitude among all past 'buying streaks' in over a decade,\" Emma Wu, a strategist at JPMorgan said in a note on Wednesday.JPMorganAccording to Wu, the trading activity suggests that retail investors are still in \"buy the dip\" mode, seeking opportunities as the broader stock market enters correction territory.While retail investors are buying up Tesla shares, insiders at the company are selling.Since November, company insiders, including board directors, the CFO, and Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal, have sold a combined $335.2 million of Tesla stock.The stock sales occurred mostly at prices between $300 and $400 per share, according to filings made with the SEC. Tesla stock traded at about $242 on Friday.James Murdoch, a director on Tesla's board, made the most recent insider sale. On March 10, Murdoch sold $12.9 million worth of Tesla stock at about $240 per share.But at a town hall hosted on Thursday evening, Tesla CEO Elon Musk urged Tesla employees to hold onto their stock despite the recent volatility, which has been sparked in part by an ongoing boycott of the Tesla brand.\"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?\" Musk said on Thursday night, before adding that autonomous driving will unlock Tesla's true value on Wall Street.\"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The private equity billionaire, an early investor in Frank, is the first defense witness for Javice, accused of tricking JPMorgan Chase out of $175M. Charlie Javice's defense team called its first witness Thursday.AP Photo/John MinchilloCharlie Javice began calling defense witnesses Thursday in the JPMorgan fraud trial in New York.Her first is Apollo's Marc Rowan, an early investor and board member for her website, Frank.Rowan praised Javice and Frank, and testified he had little involvement in the JPMorgan merger.Frank founder Charlie Javice kicked off her defense case with some firepower at her JPMorgan Chase fraud trial Thursday — calling private equity billionaire Marc Rowan to the witness stand.The Apollo Global Management cofounder and CEO told a federal jury in Manhattan that he was an early investor and board member of Frank, explaining that he had been impressed with the student financial aid platform's prospects and leadership.\"Favorable,\" he said when asked for his first impression of the young entrepreneur, who was in her mid-20s when they met in 2017. \"She seemed to have an interesting take on how to tackle the market.\"Rowan wore a black suit and white dress shirt — no tie — and sipped from a plastic water bottle as he spoke. He and Javice exchanged two-handed waves and broad smiles as he left the courtroom for Thursday's lunch break.After the break, Rowan was to continue under questioning by Javice's attorney, Christopher Tayback of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.Rowan testified that he had little direct involvement in the 2021 JPMorgan merger at the center of the fraud case.Federal prosecutors say Javice and codefendant Olivier Amar, her second in command at Frank, conspired to trick JPMorgan — the nation's biggest bank — into paying $175 million for the website.By the lunch break, Rowan had not been asked about the allegation that Javice and Amar fraudulently claimed to JPMorgan that Frank had the personal information for 4.25 Frank users — college and high school students who the bank was interested in marketing checking accounts and credit cards to.He did recall that, in the first week of August 2021, he spoke with Javice about the scramble to meet JPMorgan's pre-purchase demands for verification of Frank's student dataset.The two spoke about \"how overwhelmed the company was in responding to this data request,\" he testified.Rowan started his testimony by describing his earliest involvement with the startup and Javice.\"It was really at the beginning of its journey,\" Rowan told jurors.The two had been introduced through one of his colleagues, who, like Rowan and Javice, had attended the Wharton School, he said.Though he remained at arm's length on the JPMorgan deal, Javice did share with him one early victory in the negotiations, he said. As part of the merger negotiations, she'd had a one-on-one with JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, Rowan said.\"She reported a very enthusiastic meeting with the CEO,\" Rowan said with a smile.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Aerial view of JPMorgan's Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio.JPMorgan ChaseJPMorgan Chase told workers of its Columbus, Ohio, campus to prepare to return full-time April 21.The memo noted there will be additional parking, a new shuttle service, and upgraded dining options.Not everyone is enthusiastic about the changes, and three employees told Business Insider why.Employees of JPMorgan's largest US campus received their return-to-office marching orders this week in a memo that also outlined the bank's plans for addressing a lack of key amenities, like food and parking.The bank told workers of its Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio — a tech hub that houses roughly 12,000 employees — to return to the office five days a week beginning April 21, according to an internal memo viewed by BI.\"We're focused on making your full-time return to office as smooth as possible,\" read the memo, which was sent to employees of the Polaris office on Monday.\"To ensure everyone can find parking, an offsite parking lot, located nearby, will offer free and ADA compliant, shuttle service, ensuring convenient and accessible transportation to and from the office throughout the day,\" the memo said. The bank also promised \"upgraded\" dining options.Polaris employees who spoke to BI, however, said they were unimpressed with some of the solutions offered in the Monday memo, including the off-site parking.\"The last thing that I want to do after a full day of work is stand with a group of my coworkers, hope there is enough room on the next bus, ride for 10 minutes to my car parked at the mall, and then drive home,\" said a product manager who commutes about 30 minutes one-way to Polaris. He said he'll try to get to the office early to avoid the hassle.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in January called the bank's hybrid workers, who made up less than 30% of its total headcount, back to the office five days a week starting in March. The RTO deadline for employees of the Columbus office, however, was delayed to give the bank time to get it ready.\"Our teams have been working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees will need to return to the office full-time,\" a spokesperson told BI, adding, \"We have about 12,000 employees working in Polaris. We would not have asked employees to return if we did not have the capacity to accommodate them.\"Polaris, which houses many of the bank's tech workers and is key to several of its cloud-focused initiatives, was built to accommodate some 12,000 workers. According to internal documents about the property reviewed by Business Insider, the site is home to 13,601 employees with a total seating capacity of 11,930.The JPMorgan spokesperson, however, said that the 13,000 number includes \"engineers, service staff, security guards, and other folks who aren't in the building daily.\"Still, employees have complained about what they perceive as a lack of desks, parking, or conference rooms, including in employee group chats. In one recent chat, employees discussed a document that appeared to outline how the bank might enforce its RTO mandate, as BI reported last week.Food upgradesIn addition to parking, the memo also promised of upgraded dining options, such as a \"new chef's table option,\" \"more guest restaurants in the atrium,\" as well as \"an exciting new on-campus dining option\" coming later this fall.Two other Polaris-based employees told BI that having more on-site dining choices will be key to ensuring a smooth return now that workers won't want to give up coveted parking spots or take the shuttle to and from their cars. They noted that one of the two cafeterias at Polaris have been closed for years.\"Leaving for lunch will no longer be an option,\" one software developer told BI.Still, one expressed concern that even with more on-campus dining options, five days RTO will eat into their productivity.\"The complaint that we have really is that everybody's lunch is 12 to 1,\" said a different tech worker. \"Trying to go to lunch at that time means you're in a line forever.\"The Polaris campus is among JPMorgan's largest at 2 million square feet. It was renovated in 2023 with state-of-the-art technology, including lights that automatically dim in the daytime and water-saving faucets and flushers, according to a JPM press release post-renovation. It is also the site of a leaked town hall with Jamie Dimon in February over the bank's return-to-office mandate.Polaris workers told BI they are also bracing for a potentially messy desk situation.\"It's all open seating with no walls between you and the people sitting around you, who may not even work in your department,\" said the product manager. \"Everyone is on their own Zoom calls, which can be distracting if you are trying to put your head down and get work done,\" he added.Workers who don't snag a desk are being told to \"just log in using their own device in the atrium or conference center,\" the software engineer said, adding, \"they are so not prepared for this.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Aerial view of JPMorgan's Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio.JPMorgan ChaseJPMorgan Chase told workers of its Columbus, Ohio, campus to prepare to return full-time April 21.The memo noted there will be additional parking, a new shuttle service, and upgraded dining options.Not everyone is enthusiastic about the changes, and three employees told Business Insider why.Employees of JPMorgan's largest US campus received their return-to-office marching orders this week in a memo that also outlined the bank's plans for addressing a lack of key amenities, like food and parking.The bank told workers of its Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio — a tech hub that houses roughly 12,000 employees — to return to the office five days a week beginning April 21, according to an internal memo viewed by BI.\"We're focused on making your full-time return to office as smooth as possible,\" read the memo, which was sent to employees of the Polaris office on Monday.\"To ensure everyone can find parking, an offsite parking lot, located nearby, will offer free and ADA compliant, shuttle service, ensuring convenient and accessible transportation to and from the office throughout the day,\" the memo said. The bank also promised \"upgraded\" dining options.Polaris employees who spoke to BI, however, said they were unimpressed with some of the solutions offered in the Monday memo, including the off-site parking.\"The last thing that I want to do after a full day of work is stand with a group of my coworkers, hope there is enough room on the next bus, ride for 10 minutes to my car parked at the mall, and then drive home,\" said a product manager who commutes about 30 minutes one-way to Polaris. He said he'll try to get to the office early to avoid the hassle.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in January called the bank's hybrid workers, who made up less than 30% of its total headcount, back to the office five days a week starting in March. The RTO deadline for employees of the Columbus office, however, was delayed to give the bank time to get it ready.\"Our teams have been working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees will need to return to the office full-time,\" a spokesperson told BI, adding, \"We have about 12,000 employees working in Polaris.

It is one of many Signal chats and Reddit threads that JPMorgan employees are turning to as unofficial \"support groups\" for employees.\"There's a depressingly small amount of official information within JPMC,\" they said, expressing their concern about the lack of emails about what's happening. \"We have to go find the information, it is not being broadcast.\"Last week, a document with JPMorgan branding was shared with the group and caused an instant hubbub, a different member of the chat told BI, which viewed the contents. It appeared to be an outline of steps of escalation for employees who don't meet RTO mandates, including a lower number of non-attendance warnings before possible termination for some.BI was unable to verify the authenticity of the document or determine who dropped it in the encrypted chat. It is also unclear if it represents current or future bank policy. What is clear based on chat members' reactions to the 6-page outline is that JPMorgan Chase employees are hungry for any clues to how the bank will enforce its 5-days-in-office policy, which began rolling out March 3.A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the document but said, \"If employees are not meeting the expectations, there will be ramifications — just like any other performance issue.\"Employees are also eager to understand how their attendance is monitored. Some worry that company tracking methods might not correctly record their hours or productivity — putting them at risk of potential enforcement.

An employee who BI did not speak with shared that their manager had shown them a new tool with a heat map that shows how productive employees are based on the items worked on per hour.

The chat-group document mentioned such patterns as grounds for managers to open HR cases against workers.JPMorgan also has a long-standing tracking tool, Workplace Activity Data Utility, also known internally as WADU. While these types of surveilling mechanisms aren't new at JPMorgan, as BI has previously reported, they add tension to an already fraught situation around the return to office.JPMorgan's RTO roll-out has been met with praise, disdain, and confusion. Bank employees said some offices didn't have enough desks, parking, or conference rooms, and that the messaging felt rushed and unplanned. In its memo announcing the mandate, the bank acknowledged that capacity restraints would mean that some offices aren't yet ready, and are maintaining their hybrid in-office policies, working one or two days from home until further notice.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a February interview with CNBC that he's aware this strict policy could result in employees leaving the company and that he's fine with that attrition.But not everyone who's unhappy about the 5-day RTO is considering leaving the company. Some employees are exploring the possibility of a union and are working with Communications Workers of America, an organization that led the effort of around two dozen Wells Fargo branches unionizing, as BI previously reported.Have a tip?

        "description": "Stocks have plunged in amid fears that tariffs will weigh on economic growth. Yet, there may be a more under-the-radar reason behind the sell-off. Stocks have been rocked by tariff fears this week.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesRecession fears aren't the reason stocks have tumbled in recent week, JPMorgan said.Instead, the bank blames data showing equity quant funds reducing their positions.Credit markets, meanwhile, aren't yet taking the stock market's recession fears seriously. Recession angst is roiling Wall Street as investors worry President Trump's trade war will be a hit to growth, but that's not why markets keep plunging. In JPMorgan's view, there's an under-the-radar reason the market is struggling. The bank said in a note this week that a corner of the hedge fund sector might be to blame for the recent weakness, rather than investors repricing the risk of a recession in 2025. What's more, analysts added that the weekslong sell-off may be waning. \"The recent US equity market correction appears to be more driven by equity quant fund position adjustments and less driven by fundamental or discretionary managers reassessing US recession risks,\" according to a team of strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.\"In our mind the most likely culprits are equity hedge funds and in particular two categories: Equity Quant hedge funds and Equity TMT Sector hedge funds.\"The note follows weeks of seismic moves in equity markets, with major indexes now hovering in correction territory. The benchmark S&P 500 is down 9.7% from its late February high.Blame has chiefly fallen on deteriorating macroeconomic conditions as weakening data points and trade war threats have sent volatility soaring.JPMorgan also spotted this trend, noting that recession implications were creeping up across asset classes. But while equity and rate markets indicated recession odds as high as 50%, credit markets are pricing in remarkably lower chances.\"This divergence has been a phenomenon for most of the previous two years with multiple occasions when rate markets or equity markets priced in a high probability of US recession, while credit markets were much less concerned. At the end it was credit markets that were proven right as no recession took place,\" the bank said.Instead, provisional data implied that the two types of hedge funds were reducing positions. Meanwhile, retail investors have continued to buy the dip, with only one day of outflows from US ETFs has been seen since the stock market's peak on February 19.\"If US equity ETFs continue to see mostly inflows as they have thus far, there is a good chance that most of the current US equity market correction is behind us,\" Panigirtzoglou wrote.The bank's prediction is still being tested. New tariff threats from President Donald Trump weighed on the market for the third day this week. As of 1:04 p.m. ET on Thursday, the S&P and Nasdaq Composite were 1.10% and 1.68% respectively. Still, others also suggest that recession fears might be overblown. Wells Fargo's head of equity strategy said the risk as a long-shot, telling CNBC that tariff noise likely won't be an issue in a year.Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley pointed out that the stock correction might stall around the 5,500 level for the S&P 500, less than 0.5% from where the index was trading Thursday afternoon.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Over the last month, Jamie Dimon has rapidly emerged as one of the most vocal proponents of the return-to-office movement. During a recent appearance at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, the J.P. Morgan Chase CEO could not help but complain—again—about workers who were pushing back on RTO policies. When fielding a question about his recent colorful remarks on RTO, Dimon noted that it was only “people in the middle” who were unhappy about going into the office. “If you work in a restaurant, you’ve got to be in. You all may not know this, but 60% of Americans worked the whole time,” he said, seemingly in reference to the pandemic. “Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?” “You got UPS and FedEx and manufacturers and agriculture and hospitals and cities and schools and nurses and sanitation and firemen and military. They all worked,” he added. “It’s only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it.” Dimon has had a lot to say about workers who are reluctant to return to the office. This month, J.P. Morgan started requiring that employees come into the office five days a week, officially ending its hybrid work policy. The new mandate—which was announced at the start of the year and echoes a broader shift across corporate America—stirred up discontent among the company’s workforce and even prompted an online petition making a case for hybrid work, which has since drawn nearly 2,000 signatures. Dimon, however, was quick to dismiss employee concerns. “I don’t care how many people sign that fucking petition,” he said during an internal meeting, according to a recording obtained by Reuters. “Don’t give me the shit that ‘work from home Friday’ works.” Dimon added that the company would not allow managers to approve or make decisions about in-office requirements. “There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,” he said. “Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.” He also argued that employees did not pay attention during Zoom meetings and called for J.P. Morgan to increase efficiency by 10% through through cutting down on training sessions and the number of documents produced by the company—as well as meetings. (J.P. Morgan was not immediately available for comment.) Like plenty of other CEOs, Dimon has embraced a full return to the office under the pretext of promoting collaboration and productivity. But Dimon has been far more blunt and outspoken than some of his peers—not to mention more dismissive of dissent from employees. While he later apologized for the language he used in the internal meeting, noting that he should “never curse” and “get angry,” Dimon has continued to double down on his stance that employees should work from the office full-time. “I completely respect people that don’t want to go to the office all five days a week—that’s your right,” he told CNBC recently. “But they should respect that the company is going to decide what’s good for the clients [and] the company, not an individual. So they can get a job—and I’m not being mean—they can get a job elsewhere.” Dimon also referenced the petition again, though he struck a different tone than he did when speaking to his staff. “There’s a petition,” he said. “And they have the right to feel that way. But we’re not going to change. We’re going back to the office.” Of course, as J.P. Morgan employees have returned to the office this month, they have reportedly encountered many of the same issues facing workers at other companies, from limited workspace to noisy colleagues. And despite his open disdain for remote work, Dimon does seem to believe in its efficacy for certain workers—namely, the people staffing J.P. Morgan’s call centers. “We did it to see if they’d be effective,” he said at the Stanford event. “They’re highly effective. They work from home.”",

A day after Delta Air Lines cut its guidance, citing lower U.S. consumer confidence, three more airlines made similar comments about the current macroeconomic environment. In presentations made Tuesday (March 11) at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines revised their outlooks downward or said they expect earnings to come in at the lower end of their guidance. American Airlines updated its first-quarter guidance to call for its first-quarter revenue to be flat compared to a year earlier, rather than seeing a gain of 3% to 5% as it had previously forecast, according to a presentation issued Tuesday. The company attributed the change to wildfires, Sunbelt weather, the Flight 5342 crash, softness in the domestic leisure segment and “increasing macroeconomic uncertainty.” Southwest Airlines said in a Tuesday presentation that it expects its RASM — a measure of operating revenue production based on available seat miles flown — to see a year-over-year increase of 2% to 4% rather than the 5% to 7% it forecast in its prior guidance. Speaking at the conference, Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said the airline lowered its guidance primarily because bookings have weakened in the current macroeconomic environment, the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday. United Airlines said it now expects its first-quarter earnings to come in at the lower end of its forecast, Reuters reported Tuesday. The airline said it had seen that government-related travel bookings were down 50% and that the domestic leisure market was also being impacted by government spending cuts, according to the report. Delta Air Lines said in a Monday (March 10) press release issued ahead of the conference that it now expects its total revenue to grow 3% to 4% year over year during the March quarter, down from its earlier guidance of 7% to 9%, and its operating margin to be 4% to 5%, down from its previous guidance of 6% to 8%. “The outlook has been impacted by the recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in Domestic demand,” Delta said in the release. “Premium, international and loyalty revenue growth trends are consistent with expectations and reflect the resilience of Delta’s diversified revenue base.” The post Airlines Report Bookings Drop Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Delta Air Lines said Monday (March 10) that macro uncertainty has softened demand in the domestic market. In a press release issued ahead of the airline’s presentation at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference set for Tuesday (March 11), Delta said it revised its March quarter outlook downward compared to the guidance it provided Jan. 10. The airline now expects its total revenue to grow 3% to 4% year over year during the March quarter, down from its earlier guidance of 7% to 9%, and its operating margin to be 4% to 5%, down from its previous guidance of 6% to 8%, according to the release. “The outlook has been impacted by the recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in Domestic demand,” Delta said in the release. “Premium, international and loyalty revenue growth trends are consistent with expectations and reflect the resilience of Delta’s diversified revenue base.” When Delta announced its initial guidance for the first quarter in January, the company said in an earnings release that it was building momentum as it closed out 2024 and that demand trends accelerated through the fourth quarter of the year. “With strength continuing into the new year, we expect March quarter adjusted revenue to be 7 to 9 percent higher than 2024 on growth in capacity and unit revenue,” Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the Jan. 10 earnings release. On Feb. 17, Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 crashed and landed upside down at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The airline’s response to the crisis — offering $30,000 to each of the 76 passengers involved — made headlines and sparked a debate about the adequacy of the compensation and its potential long-term effects on customer loyalty. Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Monday that concerns about safety from that and other incidents in the airline industry “somewhat exacerbated the impact on us.” Bastian attributed the softness in domestic demand to weaker consumer confidence among both leisure and business customers. The Conference Board said Feb. 25 that worries about trade and tariffs led to February seeing the biggest monthly decline in consumer confidence since August 2021.

Payroll payments provider Papaya Global reportedly added Citibank as a sponsor bank, joining the company’s other sponsor, JPMorgan Chase. The relationship with Citi will enable Papaya Global to expand to new geographic regions, Payments Dive reported Monday (March 10), citing its interview with Papaya Global CEO Eynat Guez. With the addition of Citi as a sponsor, Papaya Global will keep enhancing its cross-border payments capabilities that currently encompasses 160 countries and 130 currencies, and serves clients in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Asia, according to the report. “Multinational organizations simply cannot rely on error-prone manual inputs, capricious data security, changing FX rates, and erratic land dates when paying employees and contractors,” the company said in the report. Papaya Global did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company said Wednesday (March 5) that it formed a partnership with verification and compliance solutions provider Sumsub, in which Sumsub will offer Papaya artificial intelligence (AI)-powered fraud prevention and verification solutions. “When you enable global workforce payments, as we do at Papaya, thorough compliance and security is a top priority,” Amit Levi, senior vice president of product at Papaya Global, said at the time in a press release. “Anything less than that simply isn’t acceptable when serving enterprise clients. With Sumsub, we can take our compliance engine to the next level and deliver at scale, supporting our clients and their employees.” Papaya Global teamed up with cross-border payment platform dLocal in April to enable global firms to pay employees worldwide in local currencies in a timely fashion. The partnership launched in Latin America, including Chile, Colombia and Mexico; in Asia, including Indonesia and Vietnam; and in Africa, with plans to expand to additional territories. “The partnership with dLocal is exciting, because it speaks to the core of our mission at Papaya,” Ori Shilo, vice president of business development and partnerships at Papaya Global, said at the time in a press release. “Together, we are reshaping the global payments landscape, ensuring a premium payment experience without borders or compromises, and providing our customers with a strong base for scale and growth.” The post Report: Papaya Global Adds Citi as Sponsor Bank appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Wells Fargo reportedly sued JPMorgan Chase on Monday (March 10), alleging that the bank knowingly made a loan based on faulty numbers, knowing that the loan would later be sold off in pieces to investors. In its lawsuit, Wells Fargo seeks to recover losses for investors, Reuters reported Monday. Reached by PYMNTS, JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the report. The case involves a $481 million commercial real estate loan made in 2019, according to the report. Wells Fargo alleges that JPMorgan Chase learned before the purchase closed that the seller had overstated the property’s historical net operating income by 25% but went ahead with the loan because parts of it would be sold to investors, the report said. When the borrower defaulted in 2022, investors lost tens of millions of dollars, per the report. With its lawsuit, Wells Fargo aims to force JPMorgan Chase to repurchase the loan or pay damages for breach of contract, according to the report. It was reported in November that double commercial property loan defaults were at their highest point in 10 years. This situation raised worries that a lending practice known as “extend and pretending” was masking an increasing system risk and that the increase in loan modification was distorting loan markets. In October, the New York Federal Reserve warned that lenders seemed in many cases to be offering breaks to property borrowers for the sole purpose of delaying a write-off. “Banks’ ‘extended-and-pretended’ their impaired commercial real estate mortgages in the post-pandemic period,” the central bank’s researchers wrote, cautioning that generous modifications could lead “to credit misallocation and a build-up of financial fragility.” In April, it was reported that banks were facing a $2 trillion “wall” of property debt and must reduce their exposure to commercial real estate as that debt comes due. “Banks will be under pressure,” Newmark CEO Barry Gosin told the Financial Times (FT) in an interview posted April 1. Newmark, a real estate advisory and brokerage company, said at the time that the estimated $2 trillion of U.S. commercial real estate debt maturing between then and 2026 would have to be refinanced at much higher interest rates.

Banking giants are trying to catch up to FinTechs in offering pay later services. A report Saturday (March 8) by the Financial Times (FT) examines this trend, using the example of JPMorgan Chase’s recent partnership with Klarna to offer installment loans to its 900,000 business clients. Citi, meanwhile, began offering deferred payment loans through Apple Pay in January, becoming the first big bank to partner to team with the tech giant on that front. The FT said banking giants want to expand into the growing buy now, pay later (BNPL) space amid a rollback in regulations governing deferred payments lending, and the fees that providers can charge. In addition, the report added, big banks’ retail business are facing pressure from rising interest rates and competition from FinTechs. “This is one of the big reasons banks have lost some market share to FinTechs, so this is partly a defensive move,” said Aaron McPherson, founder of AFM Consulting. “Other banks will follow.” For example, the report said, profits for Citi’s U.S. personal banking business — which includes credit cards and domestic retail banking — dropped 24% last year. Part of the reason for the decline, the FT said, has been the growth of BNPL plans, which have been taking customers from banks’ credit card divisions. PYMNTS noted as much last week in a report on credit card debt data from the Federal Reserve, writing that the scaling back on traditional avenues of credit could mean that consumers are choosing instead to take on BNPL plans, tied to debit accounts. “The torrid pace of activity at the likes of Sezzle and Affirm — as many categories saw double-digit spending (and Sezzle notched triple-digit revenue growth) — has far outstripped the growth in the Fed’s data,” that report said. “PYMNTS Intelligence has estimated that credit card debt has become fairly ubiquitous: Among high-income cardholders annually earning more than $100,000, 75% have an outstanding credit balance. This share is the same for middle-income cardholders annually earning between $50,000 and $100,000.” The report added that a similar share of lower-income consumers — people earning less than $50,000 per year — carry balances on their credit cards. And as covered here last week, BNPL plans are popular among consumers of all income brackets. While 75% of people who live paycheck to paycheck have used these plans in the last year, the trend is not confined to low-income households. “Even consumers earning more than $100,000 annually are turning to installment plans, signaling that these options appeal across all financial levels,” PYMNTS wrote.

Since she joined JP Morgan in 2022, she has worked from home two days a week. Meanwhile, I've been working remotely as a freelancer in sports marketing.Starting in March, my partner will have to go into the office four days a week — and that's only due to the lack of desk space on-site. Once that's resolved? The assumption is that she'll be in the office full-time.My partner and I have spent much of our relationship benefiting from the ability to work remotely.Having been told that her employer, JP Morgan, is now demanding full-time office hours, I'm concerned about how our relationship will be affected — not only in the immediate future but our long-term goals, too.Working from home brought us closer togetherMy partner and I both live hectic social lives. Time spent at home and in each other's company is precious. Two days a week working side-by-side might not sound like quality time, but it encompasses a lot.We typically walk and talk on our lunch breaks while catching some fresh air. We sometimes cook lunch together and escape whatever work woes occupy our brains. We often catch up on chores during the workday, facilitating further time spent together in the evenings that would otherwise be occupied with the mundane.Thanks to working from home, she also forgoes the hourlong commute at both ends of her workday, giving us even more time together.That precious quality time is something I'm terrified we'll miss.We had long-term goals that were tied to our work-from-home jobsSince my partner and I worked from home, we were able to plan for our futures outside work. Our main goal was to travel. I had hoped our jobs would head toward full-time remote work, allowing us to travel whenever we wanted.We planned to visit cities that interested us for short stays. I imagined us finishing our work days in an Airbnb and then stepping outside in the evening to explore a new part of the world.Traveling and keeping our full-time, remote jobs was our long-term dream.I thought the consistent evidence that we were fully committed to our roles and fulfilling our job duties would get us to this dream. But I was wrong. We worked hard to be forced back into the office.I'm scared of what comes nextMy partner is about to start working four days a week in the office. She thinks it's only a matter of time before she must be there five days a week.Gone will be those shared lunch breaks and the connection they offered. Gone will be those extra hours of personal life that no commute or lunch at home permits. But that's just the small stuff.The big impact? We can no longer look toward the future for travel plans. I'm still learning to deal with the loss of our dream. When we met, our ambitions aligned. It felt like we'd be able to experience the world as a couple — without sacrificing money, career progression, or love.All of a sudden, it feels as if our hot air balloon has burst. Thanks to the weight of realities we previously thought were untethered to our ride, we're drifting back down to Earth.While I'm sure we'll survive this change to our dynamic, the world suddenly feels a little smaller.

The CFPB did not […] The post Report: CFPB Drops Lawsuit Against Zelle Operator and Owner Banks appeared first on PYMNTS.com. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reportedly dropped its lawsuit targeting the operator and three owner banks of Zelle. The regulator said in a Tuesday (March 4) court filing that it dismissed the action against Early Warning Services, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo “with prejudice,” CNBC reported Tuesday. The CFPB did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Reached by PYMNTS, Early Warning Services declined to comment on the report. The CFPB sued the four defendants on Dec. 20, alleging that they violated consumer protection laws by failing to guard against “widespread fraud” on the peer-to-peer payments (P2P) network. The regulator alleged that the defendants failed to implement safeguards on the payment network; denied assistance to consumers who filed fraud complaints; and failed to properly investigate complaints or reimburse consumers for fraud and errors. Zelle spokesperson Jane Khodos told PYMNTS in a Dec. 20 statement that the CFPB’s complaint was legally and factually flawed, that the timing of its lawsuit appeared to be driven by political factors and that Zelle was “fully prepared to defend this meritless lawsuit.” “Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law,” Khodos said. “The CFPB’s misguided attacks will embolden criminals, cost consumers more in fees, stifle small businesses and make it harder for thousands of community banks and credit unions to compete.” Zelle said in February that American consumers and small businesses transmitted more than $1 trillion using the platform during 2024, adding that this was the most money ever sent on a P2P service in a single year. “Zelle is not just a popular way to send money, it’s a vital tool that’s transforming how money moves across America,” Zelle General Manager Denise Leonhard said in a Feb. 12 press release. “It is the go-to peer-to-peer payment method for millions of hardworking Americans, and this milestone is a testament to the trust they place in us every day.” This is the latest of about a half dozen cases brought by former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra that have been dropped by Acting Director Russell Vought, according to Tuesday’s CNBC report.
