        "description": "Jabil plans to invest $500 million to expand its manufacturing and services across the Southeastern U.S. The post Apple supplier Jabil plans $500M venture to build AI data centers appeared first on FreightWaves. Electronics component maker Jabil is betting on surging infrastructure demand for AI data centers throughout the U.S. Jabil (NYSE: JBL) said on Tuesday that it’s investing $500 million over the next several years to expand its footprint to support cloud and AI data center customers. The investment includes large-scale production facilities, capital investments and workforce development. Jabil has not announced any sites for new facilities yet, but expects its newest data center to be operational by mid-2026. “This initiative is a key element of our long-term strategy to diversify our commercial portfolio and strengthen Jabil’s presence in the U.S.,” CEO Mike Dastoor said in a news release. “While the geopolitical landscape remains dynamic, our position as a U.S.-based company with a significant domestic footprint enables us to help the world’s leading brands navigate challenges.” Based in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil is a global manufacturing and supply chain solutions company. Jabil’s customers include major brands in logistics, packaging, mobility, automotive, wearables, aerospace, enterprise, digital home, point-of-sale, printing and energy. Some of the company’s largest clients include Apple, UPS and Amazon. Related: Tech giant Foxconn creating 600 jobs with $450M Houston investment Jabil has 30 facilities across the U.S. and more than 100 worldwide, with investments in automation, robotics and process optimization. The company’s $500 million investment follows recent announcements by tech companies Apple, Nvidia and Foxconn, to create manufacturing facilities in the U.S. In February, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) announced it will invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including a major facility in Houston. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) said in April that they plan to invest $500 billion over the next four years to build AI super computers in the U.S., through partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor and SPIL. Nvidia’s investments and partnerships will include a semiconductor chips facility in Arizona and AI supercomputer plant in Houston. Taiwan-based tech company Foxconn recently said it’s investing $450 million in a 100-acre property in Houston to build an AI server manufacturing facility.

For the last three years, we've engaged in some in-depth data analysis and tea-leaf reading to answer two questions about Apple's support for older Macs that still use Intel chips. First, was Apple providing fewer updates and fewer years of software support to Macs based on Intel chips as it worked to transition the entire lineup to its internally developed Apple Silicon? And second, how long could Intel Mac owners reasonably expect to keep getting updates? The answer to the first question has always been \"it depends, but generally yes.\" And this year, we have a definitive answer to the second question: For the bare handful of Intel Macs it supports, macOS 26 Tahoe will be the final new version of the operating system to support any of Intel's chips.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "When habits forged in one workplace clash with the culture of the next, even seasoned professionals can trip up.When Bob Baxley left Apple, he did what many in tech do, he jumped straight into his next role, wasting no time between jobs. But in hindsight, that decision tripped him up. After a Friday farewell at Cupertino, he walked into Pinterest the following Monday, expecting to carry on as usual. What he hadn’t expected was to collide with a different kind of company rhythm. At Apple, work was intense but clean-cut, Baxley explained this in a recent Lenny's Podcast. Disagreements were normal, even welcomed, so long as the end goal was clarity and excellence. The culture was sharp, well-oiled and quietly unforgiving. It didn’t just shape how people worked, it soaked into their thinking, their timing, even how they spoke in meetings. That way of doing things, honed over years, had become second nature for Baxley. But Pinterest wasn’t Apple, and it didn’t want to be. The atmosphere there was softer, slower, more reflective. Baxley, still wired for Apple’s pace, quickly found himself out of step. He didn’t fail in the traditional sense, but as he put it, he “bounced off the culture”. He had brought along too much of his old self and hadn’t given the new place enough space to breathe. It’s a problem that crops up often in tech, especially when people jump from one high-pressure company to another. Cultures at big firms like Apple, Google or Meta aren’t just guidelines, they’re deeply ingrained habits. After a few years, you don’t even realize how much you’ve adapted. You’ve soaked up the norms, how to give feedback, how to push an idea, how to read a meeting room, and those instincts can clash hard with a new environment. Some people, Baxley noted, manage the switch better than others. One example he pointed to was Hiroki Asai, a former Apple executive who took a break of several years before stepping into his next big role. That pause, deliberate or not, gave him time to unwind old patterns and tune in to a different kind of workplace. It acted, in Baxley’s words, like a second \"car wash\", a way of rinsing off the mindset of the previous company before taking on something new. The lesson here isn’t that people should forget what they’ve learned, only that they need to carry it differently. What made someone valuable at one firm might still be an asset, but not if it’s wrapped in the same packaging. Apple, for instance, thrives on detail, polish and a refusal to settle for “good enough”. Those values can serve someone well elsewhere, but only if they’re expressed in a way the new team can hear. By the time Baxley landed at ThoughtSpot, a later role in his career, he had learned to hold on to the values but leave behind the tone. That meant aiming for excellence but not insisting it arrive in an Apple-shaped box. It meant asking not just “What would Apple do?” but “How do these people work, and how can I meet them where they are?” For anyone moving between roles, especially in tech where the ground shifts quickly, that kind of recalibration can be the difference between fitting in and falling flat. The temptation to jump straight into the next big thing is strong, but it comes with risk. If you don’t pause and watch, you might miss what’s really going on around you. Careers rarely unfold like neat ladders. More often they twist and turn, with moments of clarity followed by long spells of trial and error. One role might stretch you, another might humble you. But each stop along the way leaves a mark, and if you're not careful, that mark might shape more than just your resume. In the end, what matters most is not just where you go, but how well you listen when you get there.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: • When Machines Compete, People Trust Their Creative Side More• TikTok Shop Sees Surge in U.S. Activity but Still Trails Its Vision",

OpenAI’s acquisition of legendary Apple designer Jony Ive’s artificial intelligence (AI) devices startup will lead to a new computing era similar to the leap from flip phones to the touchscreen smartphone. [contact-form-7] That’s the prediction of OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, who made the revelation during a fireside chat on Friday (June 13) at the VivaTech 2025 conference in Paris. Friar drew parallels between OpenAI’s plans for AI devices and the technologies that ushered in past computing revolutions. For example, she compared the shift to moving from typing commands into a PC to an image-rich screen where people can click on icons, menus and buttons that made using a computer much easier for most people. The CFO said the io acquisition, led by Ive and a small elite team, could define how people interact with AI in the years to come — moving beyond typing and tapping into something multimodal and intuitive. “In every tech era, there’s always been a new substrate that really brought it to life,” Friar said. “In the world of the PC or the internet generation, it was the graphical user interface that really brought it to the world. … When the mobile generation happened, what really brought it to life was the touchscreen on the phone.” Today’s AI use is still trapped in old modalities, she said, much like early mobile experiences simply shrunk desktop websites. “Anything I imagine right now is probably going to seem a little cute in hindsight,” Friar added. “In the same way that 2½ years ago, ChatGPT would have felt like a dream — and here we are, 2½ years later, with half a billion people using it every single week.” While Friar did not unveil the form factor of the new interface, she hinted it would depart radically from today’s keyboard-and-screen paradigm. “I think for AI, there’s a whole new way to think about multimodality,” she said. “We’re going to stop thumb-talkers (texting) to begin with. We’re going to think about the fact that we hear, we see, we speak. And these models have an intelligence that can take all of that in.” Read more: OpenAI Acquires Jony Ive’s AI Device Startup for $6.4B Over $100 Million Per Head The $6.4 billion deal for io was a big bet on a team of 50 people, equating to over $100 million per person. What vision was worth the price? “It reminds me of mobile,” Friar said. “When mobile happened, all we did was take a website from a desktop and put it on a really small screen. … It totally missed the point of, ‘If I have location and I have mobility, I can give birth to Uber.’” OpenAI is banking on Ive and his team to revolutionize how people use devices. The team has done it before: It includes key veterans of Apple’s most iconic products. “There’s actually an incredible team that sits behind [Ive],” Friar said, citing Tang Tan, who “helped bring the supply chain to life and the design and the mechanics of the iPhone, of the Watch, of the AirPods.” The addition of io, an AI hardware startup, while substantive, is just one of several ways OpenAI is changing its business model. Due to rising demand for its AI models — 500 million people use its AI models weekly — OpenAI has extended its cloud relationships beyond Microsoft to include Oracle and CoreWeave, Friar said. It is also building its own data centers, through Stargate. Asked whether OpenAI could soon become a publicly traded company, Friar said the company is undergoing a recapitalization and will restructure its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC) — a move that could pave the way for an eventual IPO. “We are in the midst of our recapitalization,” she said. “On the for-profit side, it will become a public benefit corp. And public benefit corps can indeed go public. … Every one of our competitors is a PBC. So we think it’s the right shift to be making.” The nonprofit parent will remain integral, she added, as it provides mission alignment and governance. “We have a for-profit entity — I work in a for-profit entity, albeit we need to get to the profit point,” Friar said, as OpenAI is still losing money despite a $10 billion annual revenue run rate. “But the nonprofit is really important, because that’s where a lot of governance comes from, and it’s a big part of our mission alignment.” Read more: Apple Loses Design Muse Jony Ive Read more: OpenAI Added 1 Million Paying Businesses Subscribers Since February Read more: OpenAI Aims to Offer AI Access Through ‘Ambient Computer Layer,’ Without Screens Photo, from left: The Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar The post OpenAI CFO Says ‘Secret’ Device to Usher in New Computing Era appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

It's very — everybody cares about each other, it's never insulting, but it's intense,\" he said. \"That's not really where Pinterest was at the time.\"It's not just Apple's working environment that has a way of sticking with you, Baxley added — most major tech companies have \"really powerful cultures.\"\"You get kind of indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep.

Baxley cites Hiroki Asai as a prime example — as Apple's former Vice President of Global Marketing, Asai took years off for \"re-wirement\" prior to joining AirBnB, according to his LinkedIn.\"It also should be noted that he had — it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb,\" Baxley said. Asai and Apple did not respond to a request for comment by Business Insider prior to publication.\"At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve, used to talk about the Apple car wash,\" he added. \"That when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places.

        "description": "This week, Apple previewed its redesigned (and renumbered) operating systems at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. While the new Liquid Glass design language was the star of the show across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, there were some other standout features, like a vastly improved calling experience on the iPhone. Apple also continued its annual tradition of introducing new privacy and security features in its latest operating systems, designed to keep you and your data safer than ever. Here are three of my favorite ones coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac—and three missed opportunities. The Passwords app will now remember previous passwords With iOS 18 and macOS 15 last year, Apple introduced the Passwords app—the one-stop app for managing all your passwords. The app was Apple’s first attempt at a standalone password manager, and it provided a robust set of management tools, including the ability to autocomplete 2FA codes, share passwords with family and friends, and even organize your passkeys. In iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, Apple is adding a new feature to the Passwords app. It will allow you to see the previous passwords you’ve saved for any given website, along with the date you changed the password. It’s an especially useful feature for websites that require you to change your password periodically and do not allow you to reuse a previously used password. Now, you’ll be able to quickly glance at the past passwords you’ve used for the site and easily choose an alternate one. Texts filtered as spam will automatically have their links disabled. Spam link protection in Messages stops you from clicking on a nefarious URL While the iPhone, iPad, and Mac are among the gadgets with the best security protections built in, bad actors are becoming more clever in finding ways to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating systems they target. A common way these bad actors can infect your device with malware is by using a one-click attack. This is when the threat actor texts you a link, which you then click on. You may think this link is innocuous, but really the moment you clicked on it, it allowed the attacker to access data on your phone. Bad actors know that many people will click on links that are texted to them, even from unknown senders. But now in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, when the operating system suspects you’ve received a spam text, it will silo that text into a dedicated spam folder and convert the link to plain text—meaning it won’t be clickable. You can still read the text and link in the spam folder, but the chances of you accidentally activating the link with a brush of your thumb are reduced. And if you decide the text isn’t spam and the link is safe, you can simply move the text to your regular message screen, where the link will once again be clickable. FileVault encryption, enabled by default, keeps your data safe For over two decades now, Macs have come with an optional extra layer of data security called FileVault. The technology encrypts your Mac’s storage so none of the data can be read on it unless the user’s password is entered first. This means that someone could steal your Mac’s storage, hook it up to another computer, and still not be able to get access to the data contained on it if they didn’t know your password. Until now, FileVault has been something Mac users had to enable manually. But starting with macOS 26, FileVault will be enabled automatically for all users when they update to the new operating system. Turning on FileVault is something users should have been doing the entire time anyway, and it’s nice that Apple is finally making its activation default, as it will help secure the Mac’s data even in the unfortunate event that the computer is stolen and a bad actor has access to the drive. Still . . . there are missed opportunities While the three privacy and security enhancements noted above will make our iPhones, iPads, and Macs more secure and private than ever, it was disappointing to see that Apple didn’t add any other major privacy and security features this year. Some of the missed opportunities include: Lockable apps on Mac and Apple TV: Last year, Apple gave users the ability to restrict an app’s access on an iPhone or iPad behind Face ID or Touch ID. Before the app opens, you need to authenticate with your biometrics or PIN, ensuring that people who are using your phone or tablet can’t access data in apps you don’t want them to see. This kind of restricted app access would also be extremely useful on other devices we frequently share, such as our Macs and Apple TV. Limited calendar access: In past years, Apple introduced the ability to limit an app’s read access to just select photos in your photo library and select contacts in your address book. However, when it comes to calendars, you must either grant an app permission to access all of your calendar data, allow it to only add calendar entries, or deny all access. Still missing is the granular control to give an app read/write access to only select calendars, such as your work calendar, but not your personal one. Lockable folders: Many of us share our Macs with family members or work colleagues. A privacy and security feature Mac users have hoped for for years, which is still conspicuously absent, is the ability to lock individual folders in macOS’s Finder behind Touch ID or a password. This would prevent someone with access to your user account (say, your child) from reading—or accidentally deleting—important or sensitive documents (such as your health records). Yet despite these misses, this year’s software releases show Apple is still working to actively increase privacy and security for users across its devices. The passwords, spam link, and FileVault improvements will be available when Apple rolls out its software updates to all users in September.",

        "description": "A recent research paper from Apple raised eyebrows in the AI community after suggesting that today’s most advanced language models fail dramatically when faced with complex reasoning tasks. But that conclusion is now being challenged, not because the tasks were too difficult, but because, critics argue, the experiments weren’t fairly designed to begin with. Alex Lawsen, a researcher at Open Philanthropy, has responded with a counter-study questioning the foundations of Apple’s claims. His assessment, published this week, argues that the models under scrutiny (including Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI’s latest systems) weren’t breaking down due to cognitive limits. Instead, he says they were tripped up by evaluation methods that didn’t account for key technical constraints. One of the main flashpoints in the debate is the Tower of Hanoi, a well-known puzzle often used to test logical reasoning. Apple’s paper reported that models consistently failed when the puzzle became more complex - typically at eight disks or more. But Lawsen points out a critical issue that the models weren’t failing to solve the puzzle. They were often simply stopping short of writing out the full answer because they were nearing their maximum token limit - a built-in cap on how much text they can output in one go. In several cases, the models even stated they were cutting themselves off to conserve output space. Rather than interpreting this as a practical limitation, Apple’s evaluation counted it as a failure to reason. A second issue arose in the so-called River Crossing test, where models are asked to solve a version of the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle. Apple included setups that were mathematically unsolvable, for example, asking the model to ferry six or more agents using a boat that could only carry three at a time. When the models recognized that the task couldn’t be completed under the given rules and refused to attempt it, they were still marked wrong. A third problem involved how Apple’s system judged the responses. It relied on automatic scripts to evaluate output strictly against full, exhaustive solutions. If a model produced a correct but partial answer (or took a strategic shortcut) it still received a failing score. No credit was given for recognizing patterns, applying recursive logic, or even identifying the task’s limitations. To illustrate how these issues can distort results, Lawsen ran a variation of the Hanoi test with a different prompt. Instead of asking the models to list every move, he instructed them to write a small program (in this case, a Lua function) that could solve the puzzle when executed. Freed from the burden of listing hundreds of steps, the models delivered accurate, scalable solutions, even with 15 disks - well beyond the point where Apple’s paper claimed they failed entirely. The implications go beyond academic nitpicking. Apple’s conclusions have already been cited by others as evidence that large AI models lack the kind of reasoning needed for more ambitious tasks. But if Lawsen’s analysis holds up, it suggests the story is more complicated. The models may struggle with long-form answers under tight output limits, but their ability to think through a problem algorithmically remains intact. Of course, none of this means large reasoning models are problem-free. Even Lawsen acknowledges that designing systems that can reliably generalize across unfamiliar problems remains a long-term challenge. His paper calls for more careful experimentation i.e., tests should check whether puzzles are actually solvable, track when models are being truncated due to token budgets, and consider solutions in multiple formats, from plain text to structured code. The debate boils down to a deeper question, are we really measuring how well machines think, or just how well they can type within a fixed character limit?Image: DIW-AigenRead next: ChatGPT Linked to Delusions, Self-Harm, and Escalating Mental Health Crises",

        "description": "It was a good idea that arrived too late to matter. Apps used to be the measure of a mobile platform's worth, with Apple and Google dueling over who could list the most items in their respective stores. Today, the numbers don't matter as much—there are enough apps, and Google's attempt to replace parts of the web with apps is going away. Instant Apps, a feature that debuted in 2017, will reportedly be scrapped in December 2025. In its place, you'll just have to use the Internet. Developer Leon Omelan spotted this news buried in the latest Canary release of Android Studio (confirmed by Android Authority). The development client includes a warning that Instant Apps is headed for the Google graveyard. Here's the full notice, which is the only official confirmation from Google at this time. Google's latest Android Studio build announces the end of Instant Apps. Credit: Android Authority Instant Apps wasn't a bad idea—it was just too late. Early in the mobile era, browsers and websites were sluggish on phones, making apps a much better option. Installing them for every site that offered them could be a pain, though. Google's Instant Apps tried to smooth over the experience by delivering an app live without installation. When developers implemented the feature, clicking a link to their websites could instead open the Android app in a similar amount of time as loading a webpage. Google later expanded the feature to games.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "In 1999, I got to work on a literally once-in-a-lifetime project. As the 20th century was wrapping up, the magazine where I worked declared the personal computer the most important invention of the last 100 years. It wasn’t exactly a contrarian pick: The magazine in question was PC World. To celebrate, we put together an article looking back at 100 defining moments in computing history. I was assigned to write blurbs on several of them. One was among the most obvious landmarks, Apple’s 1984 introduction of the Macintosh, which brought the graphical interface and mouse to the masses. I had a scant 250 words to recount an oft-told tale. Not wanting to merely rehash its familiar elements, I decided to focus on the Mac’s roots and emailed the guy who came up with the project in the first place, Jef Raskin. This dusty memory resurfaced in my brain this week when I read my colleague Jesus Diaz’s article about Apple’s upcoming iPadOS 26 operating system, one of the major announcements at this week’s WWDC conference. By giving the iPad a new interface with floating, overlapping windows, the software upgrade pushes the tablet far closer to the Mac. Jesus argues that the shift not only overcomplicates the iPad but also violates Raskin’s decades-old principles about how to make computing easy and intuitive. It might sound strange to say that the iPad is getting both more Maclike and more removed from the original vision of the guy who initiated the Mac project. But both facts can coexist. Apple’s 31st employee, Raskin started at the company as its publications manager. In 1979, he got the go-ahead to work on an easy-to-use computer he named—with a slight spelling modification—after his favorite kind of apple, the McIntosh. He put together a team oozing with talent, including people who would become some of the most legendary Apple staffers of all time, such as Bill Atkinson (who died last week), Burrell Smith, Bud Tribble, and Joanna Hoffman. Unfortunately for Raskin, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs not only took an interest in the Mac project but took it over. Under Jobs, the computer evolved into something only tangentially related to Raskin’s concept. After leaving Apple, Raskin oversaw the development of a short-lived machine that stuck closer to his vision, the Canon Cat. In later years, he continued exploring ways to make computing more approachable as a software designer, author, and teacher. He died in 2005. I no longer have the email I sent Raskin when working on that PC World article. But I managed to preserve the reply that landed in my inbox on August 16, 1999. Rereading it for the first time in years, I saw that it mentions me having asked about the degree to which the Mac was modeled on ideas developed at Xerox’s PARC lab, a font of inspiration for the entire computer industry. I also seem to have requested his take on the state of interface design a decade and an half after the Mac’s debut. Here’s what he had to say—verbatim, except for the name of a publication he misremembered and some relevant Internet Archive links I’ve added. Harry, For background, if you have not read my article “Holes in the Histories” (published in Interactions, also at www.jefraskin.com), you might want to take a look at it. My c.v., in case you need dates or references, is also at that site. The most accurate account of the Mac’s history that I have seen in print is in Linzmayer’s book Apple Confidential. So much for background. I do not think that the famous visit to PARC had much influence at all on the design of the Mac’s (and therefore Windows’) interface. What it did do was get rid of Jobs’ antipathy to interface-oriented design and allowed us to proceed without his earlier opposition to the Mac project. On the other hand, the migration of designers and engineers from PARC made the Mac interface more PARClike (and, in my opinion, harder to use, but spiffier and probably more marketable). Whether we would have had fewer such people if Jobs had not made his visit is not clear, because a number of us had been recruiting from PARC even before Jobs was on board with the Mac. You ask where we are, with respect to interfaces, in 1999: To put it briefly, in a mess. Our “personal” computers, whether PC or Mac, are more complex, larger in every way (except external physical dimensions), and more powerful than the mainframes and minicomputers we were rebelling against when the microcomputer revolution started. While today’s interfaces are far more pleasant and interactive, at least on the surface, than what they replaced, they are in fact convoluted, complex, opaque, and remarkably prone to crashing at the least provocation, or just out of natural inanimate perversity. The present GUI paradigm is inefficient, and has not scaled to today’s needs. It also violates much of what we know about how people can most effectively use computers. A complete rethinking is in order (some aspects of my rethinking of interface design has appeared in a number of articles, and a more complete account is the subject of my forthcoming book, The Humane Interface, to be published early next year by Addison Wesley.) To answer your question: Are we anywhere near where we should be? No. And it will take a company with guts and financial strength to stand behind the radical improvement we need. On the other hand, they stand to make billions if they do it right, and consumers will be standing up and cheering to be out from under the yoke of today’s (mainly, Microsoft’s) antihuman interfaces. At the time, I was probably most interested in Raskin’s stance that the Mac drew less inspiration from Jobs having seen PARC’s work than conventional wisdom would have it. Now, 26 years later, what sticks out for me is his astringent view of where computing had gotten by 1999. Maybe it was “pleasant and interactive,” but it was also “convoluted, complex, opaque, and remarkably prone to crashing at the least provocation, or just out of natural inanimate perversity.” Thanks to Microsoft’s Windows XP and Apple’s OS X, computers got less crash-prone in the new century. Nothing else about them changed all that much in Raskin’s lifetime, though. As they bulked up with more features, they may even have ventured further astray of his ideal of streamlined, appliance-like efficiency. But in the 20 years since Raskin left us, new products have never stopped fundamentally changing how people interact with technology. Reducing the cognitive load involved has nearly always been an overarching goal. Let’s recap. The iPhone and iPad were conceived entirely for touch input. Google’s Chromebooks turned the web browser into a full-blown computing environment. Amazon gave us Alexa, an assistant you could summon by talking to a speaker on the other side of the room. OpenAI turned its LLM into ChatGPT, a bot that’s eerily adept at understanding typed requests and responding in fluid language. Yet what Raskin told me still resonates. “The present GUI paradigm is inefficient, and has not scaled to today’s needs,” he wrote. With iPadOS 26, Apple is applying that same paradigm—resizable windows and menus, manipulated by a pointer—to the iPad. In 1999, the company had just the Mac to worry about; at this year’s WWDC, it rolled out interface updates for computers, phones, tablets, watches, TV boxes, and headsets. Even if you’re impressed by them—I loved the demo I got of the Vision Pro’s VisionOS 26 and will write about it next week—that sounds like the scaling problem Raskin saw in 1999, times six. And once a platform exists, it quickly grows resistant to the kind of complete rethinking he told me was in order. I don’t mean to bash Apple alone. After giving Windows its most dramatic makeover ever with Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has spent the subsequent years trying to dial in an experience that somehow looks to the future while also pleasing people who might be satisfied with Windows XP if it remained an option. Chromebooks, which started out rejecting native apps as an idea before succumbing to the temptation to support Android ones, have wrestled with similar issues. Back in 1999, faced with cramming the prehistory of the Mac into a tiny write-up, I quoted Raskin’s point about Jobs’s PARC visit warming him to the potential of the embryonic Mac project, and didn’t get into his harsh assessment of current interfaces. But even that didn’t see print. Like most things that get published in dead-tree magazines, my Mac origin blurb was trimmed by an editor to fit the layout. I must have noticed that Raskin’s quote didn’t make the final cut, and regret its excision today. At least I’ve been able to belatedly share his entire email here—something that wouldn’t have even occurred to me was possible in the space-constrained days of computer magazines. In it, he posed a question about computer usability: “Are we anywhere near where we should be?” The answer, he said, was no. I don’t presume to know how he might feel today. But the question remains a good starting point for judging new products. It always will be. And holding them to high standards, as Raskin did, is the best way to answer it.

Apple reportedly aims to bring an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered upgrade of its Siri voice assistant to market in spring 2026, after facing delays and failing to meet its original goal of fall 2024. [contact-form-7] The new Siri features could be previewed in the fall before being released in the spring, Bloomberg reported Thursday (June 12), citing unnamed sources. When asked by Bloomberg about the release date, Apple said it hasn’t announced an exact date but noted that it said earlier that the Siri upgrades are planned for the “coming year.” Apple originally announced the features it planned to add to Siri in June 2024, according to the Bloomberg report. These capabilities were marketed last year and were set to be launched in fall 2024. The company’s targeted release date was later shifted to spring 2025 and then, in March, postponed to sometime in the coming year, the report said. Over that time, technical challenges led to Siri being rebuilt entirely and management responsibilities being shifted around within Apple, per the report. One of the new heads of engineering for Siri, software engineering chief Craig Federighi, said this week at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, per the report: “This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.” Apple CEO Tim Cook said May 1, during the company’s quarterly earnings call, that Apple needs “more time” to upgrade Siri’s AI capabilities, PYMNTS reported at the time. “We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands,” Cook said. When pressed by an analyst to specify reasons for the delay, Cook said, “There’s not a lot of other reasons. … It’s just taking a bit longer than we thought.” It was reported Sunday (June 8) that employees who had recently departed the company said Apple has been hit by challenges in updating Siri with the use of cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) that can provide more sophisticated responses to spoken prompts. Apple’s restrained approach to innovation in generative AI stands in contrast to rivals like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which are embracing LLMs and enterprise-scale AI solutions in aggressive and sometimes experimental ways, PYMNTS reported Monday (June 9).

After all, Apple had promised a gen-AI-powered Siri ages ago, only to backtrack and put off a release indefinitely —… When Amazon announced in February a generative-AI-infused update to Alexa, dubbed Alexa+, it seemed as if the company had metaphorically jammed its flag into the moon’s surface, proclaiming itself the winner of the gen-AI voice-assistant race. After all, Apple had promised a gen-AI-powered Siri ages ago, only to backtrack and put off a release indefinitely — and then it barely mentioned Siri at the WWDC 2025 gathering in June. Google announced that its Gemini would replace Google Assistant, but the rollout has been slow and uneven, and commentary among Google device owners is that Google Home has become less reliable in the process. This week, however, Amazon announced that Alexa+ is already being used by more than a million people (I know of just one other, personally), and with the full release of Alexa+ being teased for summer 2025, the company has taken an early lead.With gen AI, there are two equally loud and disparate voices in my head, pulling my opinion to and fro. One Katy declares, “This is the way of the future, look at all of the good that can come of this, everything will be fine!” The other Katy sneers, “Why does this thing need to know my favorite color, anyway?”As Amazon promised, early access to Alexa+ is a bit of a lottery: You have to sign up to request access, which Amazon seems to grant randomly, and it is restricted to owners of specific Echo smart speaker models — and then you have to wait to be invited. I requested access and heard nothing until a couple of weeks ago, when a pop-up on my Echo Show 8 asked if I wanted to try early access. Without thinking twice, I accepted, unsure of what to expect. I was curious: Amazon may have planted its flag on the moon, but would that flag be AI slop, complete with uneven stripes and oddly shaped stars?Amazon’s main Alexa+ page highlights five key features of its upgraded assistant (which will be free for Prime members, otherwise $20 a month). The first is a more conversational Alexa, capable of longer chats, customized answers, and the ability to speak naturally or change the subject. The company also promises more fluid and useful third-party integrations that will allow you to use voice commands to book an Uber or a dinner reservation, or even plan a vacation. Amazon also says that Alexa+ is designed to fix one especially nagging limitation of the original version — the inability to be personalized to the user. The company has also promised improvements to smart-home control, as well as more ways to access Alexa+ on the go. Not all of those features are available yet, and most of them are very much a work in progress. But within moments of upgrading to Alexa+, I realized that the first feature was the star of the show and informed all the others.",

        "description": "Apple OSes will soon transfer passkeys seamlessly and securely across platforms. Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of passkeys, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn't susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords. The import/export feature, which Apple demonstrated at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible. Growing pains That limitation has led to criticisms that passkeys are a power play by large companies to lock users into specific product ecosystems. Users have also rightly worried that the lack of transferability increases the risk of getting locked out of important accounts if a device storing passkeys is lost, stolen, or destroyed.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week here. A cooler-headed look at Apple’s troubled AI story Apple said at its WWDC developer conference Monday that the much-hyped Apple Intelligence features it announced at last year’s event are still not ready to ship—and likely won’t be until 2026. Now, the company is living with a media narrative that it’s failed, fallen behind, stuck in neutral, or in retreat on AI. To be clear, Apple’s various operating systems already include AI-powered features, from photo cleanup to call screening. And the company did deliver some of the Apple Intelligence tools it promised last year. But those were first-generation large language model functions like text message summarization and writing assistance—unambitious by generative AI standards and not especially useful. What got everyone excited at WWDC 2024 were the advanced, personalized AI features that allow Siri to leverage a user’s personal data and carry out actions on their behalf. Some examples: A user could say, “Hey Siri, when does Mom’s flight land?” and Siri—having access to the user’s email, contacts, calendar, and files—would know the answer. Siri would also be able to “see” what’s on the user’s screen, so it could, for example, read an address from a text message and add it to a contact card. A user could tell Siri to take action within an app, such as: “Siri, take the red-eye out of this photo,” or “Send the email I drafted to Judy and Carmen.” Cool stuff, useful, and things Apple is uniquely positioned to offer. So what happened? Apple software chief Craig Federighi and head of marketing Greg “Joz” Joswiak offered a fuller explanation during a round of media interviews Tuesday. According to them, Apple had a working “version one” of a new Siri architecture before announcing the personal AI features at WWDC 2024. (In other words: No, the demos weren’t vaporware.) The Siri team believed they could continue polishing the product until it performed reliably enough for a late 2024 release. But Federighi explained in an interview with TechRadar that the system continued to generate too many unreliable results in internal testing. When a year-end release became unrealistic, the team aimed for spring 2025. But by then, the system was still inconsistent. That’s when the Siri team concluded it would need to create a “version two” of the new Siri architecture—one that “extends across the entire Siri experience.” Until that reworked Siri is performing reliably in-house, Federighi said, the company won’t speculate on a public release date. Federighi also argued that Apple is trying to do something with personalized AI that nobody else has really done. There’s some truth to that—especially if we limit the field to mobile-based AI assistants, and when we’re talking about doing it at Apple’s scale. Apple may look like an AI laggard now, but it would look far worse if it shipped something that didn’t work or wasn’t useful. Still, it’s not accurate to say Apple is the only one in the game. In May, Google announced a suite of personalized AI features that will begin rolling out this summer. Its Gemini assistant can use personal data in email to offer summaries, draft messages, provide reminders, and deliver context-aware insights. Gemini Live can analyze objects in the camera view and on the screen. And the “agent mode” in the Gemini app, built on Project Mariner, can perform multi-step tasks for users both online and within apps. Apple’s big mistake, of course, was announcing personal AI features in 2024 that it couldn’t deliver in 2024—or even 2025. That misstep might not have happened if this were just another set of traditional software updates. But we’re not in that era anymore. Apple is now operating in the realm of probabilistic computing—the domain of AI models. The usual rules for predicting software maturity and release timelines may no longer apply. Meta to rebrand itself “MetaGPT” (just kidding) Okay, forgive the Onion-esque headline, but it holds a seed of truth. Once again, Mark Zuckerberg is spending billions to push his company to the front of the line in the next big thing in consumer tech—this time, it’s generative AI. (A few years ago, Facebook renamed itself “Meta” when it bet that the metaverse was the next big thing.) Now, The New York Times and Bloomberg report that the social media giant—after seeing its Llama models lag behind those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—is launching a new generative AI lab with ambitions of achieving “superintelligence.” (OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are pursuing “artificial general intelligence,” where AI matches or exceeds human abilities across a wide range of tasks. Superintelligence refers to AI that vastly outperforms humans at many tasks.) Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to buy a 49% stake in Alexander Wang’s Scale AI—a company that specializes in human-labeled and synthetic training data for AI models—for nearly $15 billion. This appears to be another “acquihire,” where Meta’s primary interest is Wang himself. The 28-year-old will lead the new superintelligence group at Meta. (Microsoft made a similar move when it acquired Inflection AI and brought on its founder and CEO, Mustafa Suleyman.) Meta is also offering “seven to nine figure salaries” to attract top researchers to the new lab. The company already has a major AI figure in Yann LeCun, who leads its core AI research group. But The Times reports that Meta has experienced significant internal friction over how to approach the development and deployment of AI models. The company’s focused AI efforts began in 2013 after it failed in a bid to acquire DeepMind, which ultimately went to Google. Unlike OpenAI and Anthropic, Meta doesn’t rely on selling AI models or apps. Its primary business is advertising. Thanks to its massive ad revenue, Meta can afford to open-source its AI models, effectively giving developers free access in hopes of flooding the ecosystem and becoming dominant through ubiquity. But if Zuckerberg succeeds in getting Meta to the front of the superintelligence race, that strategy could shift. The company might begin locking down its models and charging for access—just like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Hollywood is going after Midjourney, and it could be just the start Over the past couple of years, a range of content owners—news organizations, authors, artists, comics, and record labels—have filed lawsuits against generative AI companies. Their claim: these companies used copyrighted content, usually scraped from the internet, to train AI models without permission or compensation. In response, AI firms often argue that their use of such material falls under the “fair use” provision of the Copyright Act. OpenAI and Microsoft, for example, have made that argument in an ongoing copyright case brought by The New York Times. Until now, the big Hollywood studios had mostly stayed on the sidelines. That changed today when the two largest, Universal and Disney, filed a joint copyright infringement lawsuit against Midjourney, one of the original AI image generators. (Midjourney is expected to roll out a new image-to-video feature this month, which may have prompted the legal action.) The studios have been under growing pressure from artists and writers to challenge AI labs over how training data is sourced. The Disney and Universal suit may be the opening salvo in a much broader conflict between Hollywood and the AI industry. Why start with Midjourney, a relatively small player, when far larger and wealthier AI companies have used the same kinds of scraped, copyrighted data to train their models? As The New York Times notes, the lawsuit appears to set the stage for something bigger. The language goes beyond a simple dispute between two companies. The plaintiffs argue that the use of copyrighted training data “threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law that drive American leadership in movies, television and other creative arts.” Stay tuned.

        "description": "Puzzle-based experiments reveal limitations of simulated reasoning, but others dispute findings. In early June, Apple researchers released a study suggesting that simulated reasoning (SR) models, such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, produce outputs consistent with pattern-matching from training data when faced with novel problems requiring systematic thinking. The researchers found similar results to a recent study by the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) in April, showing that these same models achieved low scores on novel mathematical proofs. The new study, titled \"The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity,\" comes from a team at Apple led by Parshin Shojaee and Iman Mirzadeh, and it includes contributions from Keivan Alizadeh, Maxwell Horton, Samy Bengio, and Mehrdad Farajtabar. The researchers examined what they call \"large reasoning models\" (LRMs), which attempt to simulate a logical reasoning process by producing a deliberative text output sometimes called \"chain-of-thought reasoning\" that ostensibly assists with solving problems in a step-by-step fashion.Read full article Comments",

Meta-owned WhatsApp reportedly joined a legal challenge against the U.K. government’s demand that Apple allow it access to the company’s encrypted customer data. [contact-form-7] WhatsApp is supporting two cases — one brought by Apple and another brought by two human rights campaign groups — by submitting evidence that the government’s order would harm the encryption technology used by messaging apps and digital storage services, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (June 11). “WhatsApp would challenge any law or government request that seeks to weaken the encryption of our services and will continue to stand up for people’s right to a private conversation online,” Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp at Meta, said in the report. The order was delivered in January by the U.K. Home Office under the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act, according to the report. Apple responded by withdrawing the online backup service targeted by the order, iCloud Advanced Data Protection, from the U.K. It also launched its legal challenge, the report said. Two human rights campaign groups — Privacy International and Liberty — filed a separate legal action in March. They filed their case at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which investigates complaints against U.K. security services, per the report. A WhatsApp spokesperson told the FT that the company has not received an order like that delivered to Apple. WhatsApp has said in the past that it would respond to any threat to its encryption by withdrawing from the U.K. It was reported in March that a London court hearing related to Apple’s appeal against the order took place behind closed doors, with the media barred from attending and neither Apple nor the U.K. government publicly confirming the existence of the order. The U.K.’s Home Office remained silent on the specifics of the case, and when questioned in parliament, Security Minister Dan Jarvis refused to confirm or deny the existence of the order. Jarvis did assert, however, that privacy and security are not mutually exclusive and that it is possible to maintain both. Authorities argue that strong encryption can impede investigations into serious crimes such as terrorism and child exploitation. In April, it was reported that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal confirmed that Apple is contesting the order and rejected a request from the U.K. Home Office to keep details of the case confidential.

Now, a year later, it's still M.I.A. and Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, is speaking somewhat candidly in various interviews at this year's WWDC event about what went wrong.The short answer: Apple wants to get it right.\"When you have an experience like asking Siri to do something, either it becomes something you can depend on reliably or it's something, in the end, you're just not going to use,\" Federighi told YouTuber iJustine.With that in mind, Apple wasn't \"able to take the approach we were taking to the quality level in the time frame that initially we thought we could,\" he continued.However, work continues on building a more capable Siri that can remember the name of a guy you had lunch with months prior, the kind of situation shown off in a now-deleted ad from last year with \"The Last of Us\" actor Bella Ramsey.

Federighi described V2 as \"a deeper end-to-end architecture that we knew was ultimately what we wanted to create, to get to a full set of capabilities that we wanted for Siri.\"Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.\"We have, you know, the V2 architecture, of course, working in-house, but we're not yet to the point where it's delivering at the quality level that I think makes it a great Apple feature, and so we're not announcing the date for when that's happening,\" Federighi told TechRadar.Do you work at Apple?

        "description": "This week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced a ton of features across its various upcoming operating systems, including the all-new visual design aesthetic known as Liquid Glass, which is coming to iOS 26, iPadOS 28, and macOS 26 this fall. But the company also spent the first few minutes of its 90-minute keynote presentation focusing not on software, but on the new Brad Pitt film F1: The Movie, which is being co-distributed by its film production arm, Apple Original Films. And now Apple is further promoting the film with what is a first for the film industry: a haptic trailer. What is a haptic trailer? The unique thing about Apple’s latest F1: The Movie trailer is that it literally vibrates as you watch it. Well, as long as you watch it on a compatible iPhone. Apple calls this latest trailer a “haptic trailer.” In the two-minute trailer, whenever an F1 car is in motion on the screen, your iPhone will vibrate with an intensity proportional to the on-screen action. So when a car’s tires are being changed in a pit stop, you’ll feel a small vibration in your hand—and when the car continues racing down the track, you’ll feel an even more intense vibration. These vibration feedbacks in the gadget world are known as “haptics”—a technology that simulates physical touch. Apple can make your phone vibrate like this—and at certain points in the trailer, thanks to the iPhone’s Taptic Engine, a piece of hardware inside the iPhone that is essentially a motor that can vibrate on command. Haptic feedback has been used for years in the iPhone. For example, when you press and hold an icon on the homescreen to rearrange its layout, you’ll feel haptic feedback produced by the Taptic Engine. You can feel haptic feedback in plenty of other places on the iPhone, such as when adjusting the volume or pressing a widget in Control Center. But Apple’s application of haptic feedback to a movie trailer is the first time that the technology has been used to promote a film. Given the vibrations and forces an F1 car undergoes while racing down the track, a trailer for F1: The Movie is a natural fit for such technology. How to watch the ‘F1: The Movie’ haptic trailer To watch the F1: The Movie haptic trailer, you’ll need an iPhone running the latest version of iOS 18. You can find the haptic trailer in the TV app on your iPhone by doing the following: Launch the TV app on your iPhone. On the Home screen of the TV app, you should see the F1 haptic trailer poster image show in the top carousel. If not, you can scroll down and find a poster image for the haptic trailer lower in the Home Screen feed. Tap the poster image. Now, the F1: The Movie haptic trailer will play on your iPhone. As the trailer plays, you’ll feel various intensities of vibrations in your hand, depending on the action being performed on the screen. Apple has high hopes for ‘F1: The Movie’ F1: The Movie is the most high-profile movie that Apple Original Pictures has ever released. The movie stars one of Hollywood’s last big-name draws—Brad Pitt. It’s also directed by Top Gun: Maverick‘s director, Joseph Kosinski. Combine the star and directing power with one of America’s most popular sports—F1 racing—and you have, Apple hopes, one of the biggest hits of the summer on its hands. If the film is successful, it could help propel Apple’s film division to new heights, not to mention attract subscribers to its Apple TV Plus streaming service. However, it should be noted that F1: The Movie isn’t debuting immediately on Apple TV Plus. Instead, the film will be shown exclusively in theaters starting on June 27. The film will stream on Apple TV Plus later in the year. You can check out the non-haptic trailer for F1 The Move below.",

        "description": "Apple quietly made several changes to its Battery Settings in iOS 26, although most attention at WWDC 2025 focused on the new Liquid Glass interface. The update introduces a redesigned Battery page that aims to make power management simpler and more effective, with a few new tools added along the way. Image: iDeviceHelp / YTRather than displaying toggle switches for Battery Percentage and Low Power Mode at the top of the screen, iOS 26 now shows the current battery level more prominently. When the device is charging, the screen also shows how long it will take to reach full charge. Another small but noticeable change is that the screen auto-lock setting has moved from the Display & Brightness menu and is now found within Battery Settings instead. Battery usage data has also been updated. Instead of showing the past 24 hours and the last 10 days, Apple now presents a weekly view. Users can tap on individual days to see how much battery was used and when the phone was charged. The charts are simpler to read and give a clearer picture of power consumption over time, focusing on broader patterns rather than hourly details. The familiar Battery Health section remains, showing the usual details such as maximum capacity and number of charge cycles. However, Apple has added a new Power Mode section, which brings together existing and new power-saving options. Low Power Mode has been moved here, and a new Adaptive Power Mode has been introduced. When switched on, it allows the iPhone to automatically make small adjustments—such as dimming the screen or slowing down background tasks—to help preserve battery life. It works in a similar way to Google's Adaptive Battery feature on Android. The new features are already available to developers and will be included in a public beta version expected next month. The full release of iOS 26 is planned for later in the year, likely in the autumn. While the design changes have grabbed the headlines, these quieter improvements to everyday battery management may prove just as useful.Read next: AI Summaries Replace Clicks Leaving News Sites with Fewer Readers and Less Income",

        "description": "At Apple’s annual WWDC keynote, the highest-level subject is always the future of its software platforms. And the big news in that department usually stares us right in the face. In 2023, for example, it was the debut of Apple Vision Pro, the company’s entry into the headset market and its first all-new experience since the Apple Watch. Last year brought Apple Intelligence, its branded take on what AI should look like as a core element of computing experiences. And then there was Monday morning’s WWDC 2025 keynote, as streamed online to millions and screened to a select audience of in-person attendees at Apple Park. After Apple’s embarrassing inability to ship the AI-infused update to Siri it showed off at WWDC 2024, it was hardly surprising that this year’s event didn’t bet everything on whipping up a further AI frenzy. That alone set it apart from last month’s Google I/O keynote, whose topics consisted of AI, AI, and more AI, with some AI drizzled on top. [Photo: Apple] Apple did introduce some new AI during the keynote—quite a bit of it. Overall, though, the event felt like an act of counterprogramming. Instead of positioning itself as a leader in AI—or at least quashing fears that it’s a laggard—the company seemed happy being itself. From the unified new design to old features (phone calls!) turning up in new places (the Mac!), it focused on giving consumers even more reasons to own and use as many of its products as possible. Herewith a few of the impressions I took away from my morning at Apple Park: Liquid Glass is classic Apple, in the Steve Jobs sense. In 2012, one of Tim Cook’s first dramatic moves after succeeding Jobs as CEO was to oust software chief Scott Forstall. That led to a reorganization that put Jony Ive in charge of design for software as well as hardware. Ive’s influence was seen in the iPhone’s iOS 7 upgrade the company shipped the following year. It ditched the lush skeuomorphism of the iPhone’s software up until that time for a far flatter look, bringing to mind the understated, Dieter Rams-like feel of an Ive MacBook, manifested in pixels rather than aluminum. Ive left in 2019, but the principles he instilled have informed Apple software ever since. [Photo: Apple] But now there’s Liquid Glass, a new aesthetic Apple is rolling out across its portfolio of platforms. It’s glossy, dimensional, pseudorealistic, and animated—a dramatic departure from iOS 7-era restraint, but reminiscent of both earlier iOS releases and also older Apple software all the way back to the first version of the Mac’s OS X in 2000. That was the one with buttons that Jobs said people would want to lick—a memorable design imperative that is suddenly relevant again. As my colleague Mark Wilson writes, Liquid Glass isn’t about adding new functionality to Apple devices. It might not even be about making them easier to use—in fact, when an interface introduces transparency effects and other visual flourishes, legibility is at risk. It does, however, look cool in a way that’s classically Apple, and which the Apple of recent years had deemphasized. The iPad has left limbo . . . for Macland. For years, Apple seemed to have reached a mental standstill with the iPad. The company clearly wanted its tablet to be something distinct from a Mac, but it also appeared to be short on ideas that were different than the Mac, especially when it came to building out iPadOS as a productivity platform. End result: The platform has foundered rather than matured. [Photo: Apple] With iPadOS 26, the iPad will finally see a lot of meaningful change all at once, and most of it is distinctly Maclike. It’s getting a menu bar. Windows that float and overlap. A more full-featured Files app and, for the first time, a Preview app. Even the quirky circular cursor gives way to a more conventional pointy one. As an unabashed iPad diehard, I admit to my fair share of trepidation about all this. The iPad’s abandonment of interface cruft in favor of considered minimalism is a huge reason why I’ve been using one as my primary computer since 2011: I don’t like to wrangle windows or scour menus for the features I need, hidden among those I don’t. Maybe Apple has figured out how to retain what’s great about the iPad even as it gives in to the temptation to borrow from the Mac. But I’m alarmed by the apparent disappearance of the iPad’s foundational multitasking features in the first iPadOS 26 beta, and hope they’ll return before the software ships this fall. VisionOS is still evolving, and that’s good. It’s been two years since Apple unveiled the Vision Pro and 17 months since it shipped. Rumors aside, we still aren’t any closer to clarity on how the $3,500 headset might lead to a product that caters to a larger audience than, well, people who will pay $3,500 for a headset. Even Tim Cook says it isn’t a mass-market product. Still, Apple’s enthusiasm for spatial computing doesn’t seem to be flagging. As previewed during the WWDC keynote, VisionOS 26 looks downright meaty, with more realistic-looking avatars for use in video calls, features for watching movies and playing games with Vision Pro-wearing friends, widgets you can stick on a wall or place on a mantel in the real world, AI-powered 3D effects for 2D photos, partnerships with companies such as GoPro and Sony, and more. None of these additions will prompt radically more people to spring for a Vision Pro in its current form. But assuming that the headset doesn’t turn out to be a dead end, Apple’s current investment could help a future, more affordable version offer compelling experiences from day one. It’s still unclear whether ChatGPT is a feature or a stopgap. Apple’s own AI assistant, Siri, was acknowledged only at the start of the keynote, when Craig Federighi, senior VP of software engineering, mentioned last year’s announcements and the decision to delay the newly AI-savvy version until it meets Apple’s “high-quality bar.” Another AI helper did pop up several times during the presentation, though: ChatGPT. For example, it powers a new Visual Intelligence feature that will let users ask questions about the stuff on-screen in any app. The keynote’s example: Upon seeing an image of a mandolin in a social post, you can ask, “Which rock songs is this instrument featured in?” Given that the new Siri features Apple revealed a year ago remain unfinished, adding a dash of ChatGPT here and there is an expedient way to maintain some AI momentum. But does the company see integrating the world’s highest-profile LLM-based assistant as an attractive user benefit in itself—or just a placeholder until it can offer similar technology that’s entirely under its own control? I’m still not sure. At WWDC 2024, Federighi also talked about incorporating other AI models, such as Google’s Gemini, but no news has emerged on that front since. Even during a pivotal, unpredictable time for the tech industry, one of the WWDC keynote’s purposes remains straightforward. Apple needs to get consumers excited for the software it will ship in the fall, which isn’t necessarily synonymous with blowing them away through sheer force of AI breakthroughs. In a Bluesky conversation, one commenter suggested to me that people aren’t actually clamoring for AI at all—a take that has a whiff of truth to it even if it isn’t the whole story. Ultimately, users want pleasant products that help them get stuff done, whether in a personal context, a work environment, or somewhere in between. After last year’s WWDC, assuming Apple will ship everything it brags about—at least in a timely fashion—is dangerous. But it’s easier to envision the confident vibe of this year’s keynote paying off, because so much of it involved the company playing in its comfort zone.",

Apple is reportedly deepening its relationship with OpenAI while also rolling out new artificial intelligence capabilities. [contact-form-7] The expanded partnership with the ChatGPT maker was one of several AI-related announcements from the tech giant at its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Bloomberg reported Monday (June 9). The rollout is happening as Apple is facing increased investor discontent over the long-awaited AI updates to its Siri voice assistant. Among the new offerings from the event include live translation capabilities added to the company’s Messages, Phone and FaceTime apps, making it easier to have conversations when traveling abroad or talking with someone who speaks another language. Beginning with iOS 26, Apple’s visual intelligence feature will be able to analyze images and text on an iPhone’s screen. Users can also ask ChatGPT for more info about what they’re looking at, and search Google for similar images or products. “Despite the breadth of its rollout, the underlying strategy underscores a fundamental tension,” PYMNTS wrote following Monday’s event. “Apple is betting that measured integration, meticulous design and a deep commitment to user privacy will matter more than rapid innovation in generative AI. Investors were less convinced, with the company’s stock closing down 1.2% for the day.” While Apple has long been known for excitement and innovation, the company “delivered nothing particularly exciting or innovative during the first day of the WWDC.” In terms of the Siri upgrades, Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the company needed “more time to meet our high-quality bar,” per a report by The Wall Street Journal. “This restrained approach stands in contrast to rivals like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which are embracing large language models and enterprise-scale AI solutions in aggressive and sometimes experimental ways,” PYMNTS wrote. In the context of the larger AI economy, Apple is at risk of “strategic drift,” PYMNTS added, as most enterprise AI innovation is taking place in the cloud, powered by APIs and platforms that allow fine-tuning, multi-modal inputs and integration with large data sets. “Apple’s refusal to enter this space leaves it reliant on consumer hardware cycles and developer goodwill — both of which may wane as competitors offer richer, more adaptable platforms,” the report said.

        "description": "Apple has killed the future of computing. With iPadOS 26, it turned the dream of computing visionaries like Alan Kay and Jef Raskin (and of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, too) into an overpriced touchscreen MacBook with an optional keyboard. Back when it launched in 2010, the iPad was meant to be the escape hatch from the cluttered, file-strewn, window-management hellscape of traditional computing. It was the ultimate expression of Kay’s Dynabook, a book-like device that was mostly screen. Kay, a legendary Xerox PARC computer scientist, imagined that the Dynabook would democratize access to computers without people having to learn arcane coding languages. Today, though, the iPad has become a cluttered compromise. Apple has transformed the iPadOS into MacOS with some touch UX details. Now you can make apps run in windows that can overlap each other, just like the way you can run many iOS and iPad apps in the Mac. There are menus and submenus too, which run across the top of the screen in some apps, just like the Mac (but, unlike the Mac, they are not a permanent UX element, appearing and disappearing depending of the app you are running). Windows can tile, turning it into a finger-clickable oversize pop-up window. [Image: Apple] The power of modal UX Apple believes that all this brings more power to the user. I would argue that it detracts from it, like Raskin discovered while developing the first Macintosh computer before Jobs took it away from him in 1981. He was a computer engineer, artist, writer, and human interface expert, who originally advocated leaving the command line interface for computers with a single purpose that anyone could use without training, like a toaster or an immersion blender in the real world. These “information appliances” would have the right buttons, software, and network connectivity to perform specific tasks effortlessly. Raskin envisioned them becoming invisible to users—part of their daily life. Eventually, he realized that having one gadget for each task was impractical. His answer was the mouse and graphical user interfaces, which he believed could bring computing a bit closer to his original idea. A computer could have programs focused on specialized tasks—like word processors, painting programs, or a calculator—with specialized interfaces designed so people could understand them intuitively. He started the Macintosh project at Apple in 1979, hiring legends like Bill Atkinson, the father of the menu bar and countless other fundamental graphic UX elements (who sadly recently passed away), Andy Hertzfeld, the main architect of the Mac’s system software, and Burrell Smith, who created the Mac’s hardware. He brought on other luminaries like Steve Capps (who later helmed the Newton project, the origin of the iPhone and the iPad), Bruce Horn (who created the Finder), and Susan Kare (who designed all the Mac’s icons and made all things wonderful in the pixel world), and they went on a mission to realize Raskin’s vision. Their genius ushered in the second computing revolution. And yet, the Mac wasn’t the solution Raskin had in mind. It required users to manage files and windows. It required them to learn conventions and navigate through menus, even if it was orders of magnitude more intuitive than the command line. Soon, it got too complicated—and still is to this day. No matter how many clean-up attempts Apple has tried, it’s fundamentally too complex. It wasn’t until the iPhone and touchscreens that Raskin’s idea materialized thanks to apps that turned to the phone into a “specialize device” for each task. Later, the iPad became the ultimate expression of that powerful idea. It embodied Raskin’s core philosophy: an immersive device focused and modal, that could transform instantly into the tool you needed—a sketchpad, a typewriter, a comic book reader, a video editor. Billions of people around the planet instantly got it. One app, full screen, your mind uncluttered. The complexity was hidden; its purpose was clear. The iPad was, as I wrote back for Gizmodo when it came out, “the future.” It wasn’t perfect by any means, but it had the potential to become the ultimate computing device. Years later, I changed my Mac for an iPad Pro. I loved it. The iPad put me in the zone and minimized distraction. I used it exclusively for several years and only changed to a Macbook Air because I needed to use Premiere for new projects. [Image: Apple] A squandered golden opportunity Which brings me back to iPadOS 26 and trying to understand its very existence. Fifteen years after Apple first introduced the iPad as a new form of computing we’ve landed back on the Mac. The company that once championed simplicity against the tyranny of overlapping windows and nested menus has now bolted those things onto the iPad. With iPadOS 26 the iPad is not a truly liberated information appliance anymore, free from desktop baggage. And it’s certainly not a full-fledged Mac—as it still lacks the power-user features, the robust file system, and the sheer flexibility of macOS. We didn’t need a decade and a half to arrive at a mediocre compromise. If Apple had truly lost faith in the iPad’s unique vision—the vision that differentiated it—they should have had the guts to kill it. Just kill the damn thing and make a MacBook Air with a detachable keyboard. Go ahead. Slap touchscreens on every Mac in the line and call it a day. Just don’t make an iPad that’s less than it was meant to be, clumsily aping the thing it was supposed to replace. Perhaps clinging to the original idea of a new computing paradigm is an untenable idea. But this compromise feels particularly bad right now, right at the very moment where there’s a clear window of opportunity for Apple. Maybe the iPad should have gone totally away from the Mac and doubled down on AI. Maybe the iPad was already in the right place to become the true future of computing. It was a blank canvas. The right opportunity to reimagine computing around AI, to make it useful in a more natural way that is not constrained by the size of the iPhone (which I still think is the only true AI device, just too small to be useful for many things). And no, I don’t know what that looks like. That’s why Apple’s UX designers get paid. What I do know is Apple might have squandered its chance to create a completely new AI-based computer user experience.",

        "description": "Apple is calling it the biggest redesign in history. Starting this fall, iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, and WatchOS will all be unified under a single design paradigm for the first time: What Apple is calling Liquid Glass.Introduced this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Liquid Glass is a highly articulated reskin of iOS and its other software, intentionally launching with feature parity to not rock the boat and leaving hundreds of millions of customers unsure of how to use their phones. In the future, it’s more of a question mark. It’s a UX framework that can be exactly as ambitious as Apple chooses to be.What is Liquid Glass?The basic idea behind Liquid Glass is this: Instead of the opaque windows and menu bars we’ve grown accustomed to for years, Apple products will be united through an amorphous glass-like interface. Everything from your app dock in iOS and MacOS, the play/pause controls of Apple Music, and the URL bar in Safari to the oversized digits telling time on your phone and the widgets on your desktop, will all be some level of clear.[Image: Apple]The most overt of the updates comes in the form of a new magnifier and slider, which now seem to pop off your screen and bend the text and images underneath like a water droplet. Most of the other updates are more subtle. Turn your phone in your hand, and the new glass app icons appear to catch light around the edges.[Image: Apple]Students of design will know that this is not the first time a big company has introduced transparency as a UX modality—nor even the first time that Apple has done so. The idea traces back to at least 2000 on Apple desktops with its Aqua interface. Aqua was like a digital manifestation of Apple’s semi-transparent computers at the time (ooh those candy colored iMacs). Apple guru John Gruber reminded me at WWDC that the processor-intensive transparency chugged slowly on those computers for years until they were smoothed out. Microsoft introduced the idea in Windows Vista not long thereafter. And since, it seems that every big tech company from Google (with its interface-as-real-object Material Design standards) to Meta (with its cutting edge augmented reality Orion glasses) has at least flirted with the idea of transparent interfaces.Most recently, Apple used light-catching transparency for the menus of Vision Pro as a means to merge the UI with the environment. Apple confirms that Vision Pro was the inspiration behind extending that metaphor across its devices.[Image: Apple]Trying Liquid GlassIt’s hard not to acknowledge a certain dichotomy behind the interface. On one hand, it calls attention to itself with gee-whiz animations. (And gosh, its magnifier really is one of the singularly best-rendered UI elements I’ve ever seen—so much so that it dwarfs the articulation of the rest of the UI.) On the other, it’s all just glass, so it’s inherently about disappearing to make way for the other stuff you see: namely your photos, wallpapers, and whatever other media you’re pulling up on your screen. Apple has leaned into more customized UI for years. Now, it’s trying to be the lens through which you view the world.[Image: Apple]I was able to see Liquid Glass working across several devices. For the most part, the glass looks good. However, there are times that a glass menu bar feels muddled with color-heavy media—like that cover art in your Apple Music library. Often, but not always, Apple adjusts to such issues by cross fading the glass between a light mode and dark mode, much like a transition lens. That can feel like a solution to its own problem. But in other moments—like the airier keyboard spanning across the iPad screen—it’s refreshing to get some of your screen back as you’re literally less boxed in.It’s why I think the most earnest assessment of the updates may have come from Craig Federighi, SVP of software engineering at Apple, when he said during the WWDC keynote that transparency gives the sensation of “making your screen appear larger.” It does. It basically allows any UI tidbit to feel more like the dynamic island on the top of your iPhone. Instead of cutting your screen off in a straight line, it floats as a little bubble that can grow larger or smaller as you need it. Safari now has a full bleed edge-to-edge web browser with a floating clear URL bar. In this sense, the update feels like a lot of work to give your phone a tiny bit more not-so-functional real estate. But once you see a bigger screen, it’s hard to accept a smaller one. It’s a major reason that, practicality be damned, our phones keep getting bigger. If Apple UI can squeeze another 1 milimeter out of your screen size through software, I imagine that it will feel claustrophobic to go back.[Image: Apple]Where will Liquid Glass take us? The problem with Liquid Glass today is that, beyond a few minor UI tricks, it doesn’t do anything new. The public is waiting for Apple to articulate how AI will add meaning in our lives—and instead we got a buncha glass. Functionally speaking, Liquid Glass is less significant than the new desktop-inspired windows on iPadOS, which ostensibly turns the iPad into a Mac. I suspect the last major update to the iPhone design language (when iOS 7 shifted to airy sans serifs from its skeuomorphic roots) will feel like a bigger design jump to most people who can remember.One lauded designer friend calls the design update “masturbation,” while another dubbed it as superficial with “no thought.” A techie friend dubbed the whole event “the worst WWDC ever.” To be fair, Liquid Glass really is a mostly superficial update. There’s no significant new functionality added. It’s a luxe reskin. Apple says that’s by design—that it’s meant to feel new but familiar, to ease the countless customers across the globe into a new design language without disrupting day-to-day life.No, that’s not the most reassuring sentiment from the greatest consumer hardware company in history—that it’s taking something of a slow and steady evolution to design more akin to auto manufacturing than OS design. However, I can get behind Liquid Glass version one as craft for craft’s sake: the height of making a UI feel one with its environment. [Image: Apple]I’ll admit some disappointment that Liquid Glass’s specular (shiny) effects on the corner of app icons and other UI elements don’t actually react to light. These effects are pulled from the turn of your accelerometer rather than reacting to the real lighting sources in your environment. I get that most people probably can’t tell, though I suspect their limbic systems could note a difference. And I get that my alternative may be a ridiculous ask that would take even more processing power (and battery life) from your phone. But it’s also the very premise behind visionOS—an operating system that responds to your lighting environment to feel like one and the same thing. Part of me feels like, okay Apple, if we’re doing this—really doing this visionOS and reactive glass is the future of everything idea—then let’s use real physics. Let’s push the boundaries of tangibility to new heights. Make it all real.That high bar aside, where I agree with Apple is what this enables in terms of longer-term strategy. Liquid Glass is a metaphor that feels primed for any permutation of AI or mixed reality that they might build in the future. It’s easy to imagine Liquid Glass for something as radical as generative interfaces. In this sense, it’s a remarkable hedged bet that sets a foundation for a lot of possibilities over the next decade. And in the meantime, all of us simpletons in the flyover states will just feel like their phones just got a teeny bit bigger.I truthfully don’t think we can judge Liquid Glass today, and to some extent, I don’t know that we can this fall when it arrives on our devices. It’s a material metaphor that Apple has introduced but not really tapped—and looking at ambitions from competitors like Meta, it may be a UI approach that Apple can’t even own. We’ll only know in two to five years if, in this impossibly exciting era, the wonder glass takes us somewhere new.And in that regard, it’s an apt metaphor for Apple, too.",

        "description": "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech’s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple’s Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people’s lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a “dud” in a research note. More AI, but what about Siri? In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri — a goal that has yet to be realized.“This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn’t provide a precise timetable for when Siri’s AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won’t happen until next year at the earliest.“The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,” said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. “No amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don’t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.” Is Apple, with its ‘liquid glass,’ still a trendsetter? The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called “Liquid Glass” while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a “Workout Buddy” to help manage physical fitness.Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.“Our product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday’s conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it’s going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.“This year’s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement —positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,” Jeronimo said. Apple’s next operating system will be iOS 26 Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 — as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device’s 2007 debut.The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models. Playing catchup in AI Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, “F1” starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company’s attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple’s biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone. Regulatory and trade challenges Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google’s illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president’s first administration, but he has had less success during Trump’s second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company’s stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year — a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.Apple’s shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday — an early indication the company’s latest announcements didn’t inspire investors. —Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer",

And your laptop screen. And your TV screen. And even your watch screen. That is, if you use Apple products.The tech giant's WWDC developer conference kicked off yesterday with a keynote from CEO Tim Cook. Analysts expected the event to be \"muted\" and Apple delivered — with no shiny new thing to share.Instead, the major focus was Apple's biggest software redesign in over a decade.\"Liquid Glass\" will be available this fall in software updates for Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The new design gives screens a glass-like aesthetic — so basically, icons, switches, and sliders will be translucent. (If you can't envision it, Cook posted this video preview.)The last time Apple had a software redesign on this scale was back in 2013 with iOS 7, a polarizing move that took icons from a \"skeuomorphic\" design to the \"flatter\" look you see today.So, how will Apple users react? That's TBD. The tech giant did say that the new look is inspired by the Vision Pro, a.k.a. \"nerd goggles,\" so we'll see.Joe Ciolli/BIThat's not all that got people talking at WWDC. Here's what else sparked conversation:One word spooked investors. Apple's stock suddenly tanked more than 2.5% about six minutes into the keynote when Siri was mentioned. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said the work to make Siri more personal with AI needs \"more time.\" It seems investors didn't like the idea of waiting longer. \"We look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year,\" Federighi added.Software names are getting unified. Updates will be tied to the year, instead of the number of the update it represents. For instance, the last big update for the iPhone was iOS 18. The next one? It'll be iOS 26. Naming structures across the iPhone, Apple Watch, and the iPad will match. But Macs are the lone holdout — the next operating system will be called Tahoe.Your group chats are getting a makeover. iOS 26 will also add typing indicators — the bubble with three dots that lets you know when someone is typing — to group chats. (Before this, you could only see those in one-to-one messages.) You'll also be able to request, send, and receive Apple Cash in group chats, which could either be great or annoying, depending on whether you are the ower or owee.3 things in marketsCitigroup CEO Jane Fraser has advocated for continued remote work flexibility for years, while other Wall Street leaders support the opposite.John Lamparski/Getty Images1. Citi doubles down on WFH. The bank is giving its hybrid employees two full weeks of remote work in August, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. The move contrasts with other Wall Street firms as they demand workers back to the office full time.2. The market's big moment to weigh in on Trump's tax bill. A government bond auction this week gives investors a chance to tell Trump what they really think about his \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" If they balk, they could shake the stock market out of its current calm spell.3. Morgan Stanley's hopeful about new stock-market highs. The bank's CIO and chief stock strategist pointed to a key signal that's flashing a bullish sign: a sharp rebound in earnings revisions breadth.

The thinking is that familiarity with tools like Cursor or Bolt will help answer companies' need for speed, allowing engineers to push out products faster.2. Forget Gen Z. Gen X is driving Meta's ad business. A Barclays report shared with BI shows that Facebook's ad load — or the number of ads users see — is significantly higher for the over-45 crowd. That's because the generation has higher purchasing power, Barclays analysts wrote.3. NYC wants to be the Big AI Apple. A major theme of this year's New York Tech Week was the city's readiness to step up as a core player in the industry. The city is ready to become the next AI hotspot, and heavy hitters like OpenAI are already setting up shop there.3 things in businessWin McNamee/Getty, ALLISON ROBBERT/Getty, Getty images; Tyler Le/BI1.

Musk's autonomous leadership style doesn't work in government, and his main-character energy was no match for Trump's.2. Warner Bros. and Discovery head for divorce. Three years after its inception, WBD plans to split its streaming and cable TV business into two companies next year: Streaming & Studios and Global Networks. Wall Street, which had long questioned the WBD merger, cheered after the announcement, with WBD stock up 13% in early trading on Monday. The trouble is, BI's Peter Kafka writes, no one wants to own cable TV networks anymore.3. When Trump calls, one Big Law firm answers. Robert Giuffra, the head of Sullivan & Cromwell, helped broker the agreement between President Trump and the rival Big Law firm Paul Weiss. Giuffra has both acted as Trump's personal lawyer and unofficially advised him on using his presidential power, blurring the line between personal and government business.In other newsSorry, you can't use your Costco membership card to get through TSA.Waymo suspends robotaxi rides near LA protests after five cars were set ablaze.A top Wall Street analyst used ChatGPT and Gemini to assess Google's risks.

And your laptop screen. And your TV screen. And even your watch screen. That is, if you use Apple products.The tech giant's WWDC developer conference kicked off yesterday with a keynote from CEO Tim Cook. Analysts expected the event to be \"muted\" and Apple delivered — with no shiny new thing to share.Instead, the major focus was Apple's biggest software redesign in over a decade.\"Liquid Glass\" will be available this fall in software updates for Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The new design gives screens a glass-like aesthetic — so basically, icons, switches, and sliders will be translucent. (If you can't envision it, Cook posted this video preview.)The last time Apple had a software redesign on this scale was back in 2013 with iOS 7, a polarizing move that took icons from a \"skeuomorphic\" design to the \"flatter\" look you see today.So, how will Apple users react? That's TBD. The tech giant did say that the new look is inspired by the Vision Pro, a.k.a. \"nerd goggles,\" so we'll see.Joe Ciolli/BIThat's not all that got people talking at WWDC. Here's what else sparked conversation:One word spooked investors. Apple's stock suddenly tanked more than 2.5% about six minutes into the keynote when Siri was mentioned. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said the work to make Siri more personal with AI needs \"more time.\" It seems investors didn't like the idea of waiting longer. \"We look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year,\" Federighi added.Software",

        "description": "Apple has unveiled iOS 26, its new operating system for the iPhone. The new software brings many changes and advancements with it, including an all-new transparent design language called Liquid Glass, which allows background colors of content on your iPhone’s screen to show through interface elements like buttons and toolbars. iOS 26 is also introducing other useful features, including major improvements to the way the iPhone handles phone calls, a dedicated gaming app, enhancements to its artificial intelligence offerings, updates to Messages and Maps, and more. However, while Apple has now showcased iOS 26, not everyone can get their hands on it yet. Some can download iOS 26 today, while others will need to wait until later in the summer—or into the fall. Here’s when and how you can download iOS 26. iOS 26 developer beta: download it now Apple unveiled iOS 26 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9. That day, the company made what is known as the iOS 26 Developer Beta immediately available for download onto iPhones. However, as the “developer beta” moniker suggests, this version of iOS 26, which is now available, is only accessible to registered Apple developers. The good news is that anyone can register for the Apple Developer Program (membership costs $99 per year). But unless you’re an actual developer, it’s best to stay clear of the iOS 26 Developer Beta. The reason for this is that developer betas are notoriously buggy. In fact, one of the primary purposes of a beta program is to allow users to identify and report bugs, enabling Apple to fix them before the software is released to the general public. And some bugs can be nasty—leading to lost data or even damaged devices. That’s why, unless you are an actual developer making apps for iOS, it’s best to steer clear of the iOS 26 Developer Beta. iOS 26 public beta: download it in July The good news is you don’t have to be a developer to beta test iOS 26. Apple also offers a public Apple Beta Software Program that allows anyone who signs up for it to get early access to beta software, including iOS 26. This iOS 26 beta, released through the Apple Beta Software Program, is colloquially known as the “iOS 26 Public Beta.” This beta is generally safer to use than the Developer Beta, but Apple releases it after it has had the chance to fix some of the critical bugs that developers report finding in the Developer Beta. That bad news about the iOS 26 Public Beta is that Apple won’t release it to the public until July. The public beta is also updated a few weeks later than the Developer Beta, which means developers get any beta improvements first, while public beta testers will have to wait a while longer (again, this is primarily done to protect public beta testers from any critical bugs. Anyone can sign up for the Apple Beta Software Program for free, which will then enable you to install the iOS 26 Public Beta when Apple releases it next month. iOS 26 general release: download it in September If putting potentially buggy software on your phone doesn’t appeal to you, then you’ll want to wait for what is referred to as the iOS 26 general release. This is the finished version of iOS 26.0 that Apple will release to iPhone owners everywhere in the fall. The general release is a thoroughly tested piece of software that has (at least in theory) all of the critical bugs fixed and most of the minor bugs too. It’s the safest version of iOS 26 to put on your iPhone and is the release that Apple considers the “finished” version. Apple has historically made the general release of the latest iOS available for download in September, and we expect Apple to continue that trend this year.",

        "description": "Apple's modest AI updates announced Monday did little to shake the sense that the iPhone maker is still finding its footing in AI as rivals charge ahead.Why it matters: AI is widely seen as the largest technology shift in decades and could easily serve as an inflection point where existing leaders are dethroned and new ones crowned. Driving the news: One year after unveiling an expansive vision for personalized AI that it has largely failed to deliver, the iPhone maker focused on a smaller set of tweaks and enhancements to Apple Intelligence.Some announcements from Monday, such as live translation, are useful additions already offered on rival devices from Google, Samsung and Microsoft. In a handful of other areas, such as image generation, Apple is improving its offering by drawing more heavily on its partnership with OpenAI.ChatGPT already handles Apple Intelligence features that require more world knowledge than is available from Apple's smaller, locally run models.Apple's most significant AI move was to allow developers to make use of Apple's own models, including a 3 billion-parameter model that runs on Apple devices and a larger one that runs via Apple's servers.Yes, but: The list of things Apple left unsaid looms larger than the improvements they did announce.The company didn't expand — or even really elaborate — on the vision it laid out last year where Apple takes advantage of all that it knows about its individual users to answer questions in a privacy-friendly way. Nor did Apple announce rumored deals with Google or Perplexity to serve as additional third-party engines for Apple Intelligence.Most glaringly, the company didn't offer a concrete timeline for the improved Siri originally promised last year. Apple's Craig Federighi said only that Apple would have more to say about the delayed feature within the coming year.The big picture: Apple's incrementalism stands in sharp contrast to Google, which unveiled a host of AI features, many of which were the kinds of things that users can touch and use, such as its new tools for video creation.Microsoft, Anthropic and others have also held events in recent weeks that offered more substantive advances for developers than what Apple showed on Monday.While Apple tends to avoid being at the bleeding edge of technology, its long-standing strategy of arriving late, but polished, might not survive the fast-moving pace of generative AI.Between the lines: Apple appeared eager not to overpromise this year, announcing only features it expects to be part of the fall release.The restraint reflects the fear of repeating last year's WWDC disastrous hyping of AI features that slipped past their ship dates.However, by sharing only what it is ready to ship, Apple may have reinforced the perception that it has made little progress since last year.What they're saying: Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and equity analyst at CFRA Research said he remains positive on Apple for the long-term but called Monday's developer conference a \"dud\" that is testing investors' patience. \"In our view, monetization potential for AI is still on the table from both the services and hardware side, but we acknowledge that investors will need to be patient over the next six to nine months as the lack of AI innovation and other concerns linger,\" Zino wrote.

        "description": "Apple has taken a deliberate step toward a more cohesive and intelligent future for its devices, using this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference to unveil what may be its most far-reaching software refresh in more than a decade. At the heart of these changes lies a complete redesign of the interface language across its platforms, which the company now refers to as Liquid Glass—a visual style that reflects light, adapts to user interaction, and adds depth to previously flat screen elements. This new aesthetic, which replaces the static transparency of older designs with a more responsive and immersive surface, has been engineered to appear across iPhones, Macs, iPads, and other devices, pulling the ecosystem into tighter visual alignment. In parallel with the design overhaul, Apple introduced a new naming system for its operating systems. Rather than assigning each platform a distinct version number, the company will now identify releases by year, simplifying the naming convention that had grown inconsistent over time. All major platforms, from iOS and iPadOS to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, will now adopt labels like 26, creating a unified software identity under a single annual release cycle. Much of the company’s attention this year turned toward the integration of artificial intelligence, though Apple’s approach remains cautious and grounded in privacy. Under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence, a collection of new features has been built to operate primarily on-device. Live Translate, for example, enables real-time conversation translation directly within apps like Messages and FaceTime, without requiring data to be sent off-device. Another addition, known as Visual Intelligence, recognizes content displayed on screen and suggests actions accordingly, such as adding an event to the calendar if it detects date and time details within a viewed image or webpage. Developers will be given access to Apple’s foundational AI models through a new framework, allowing them to embed machine learning into their apps while maintaining user privacy and offline functionality. Within this shift, Apple also opened the door to integration with third-party models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which can now be used within certain apps like Image Playground. However, the company emphasized that no data will be shared externally unless a user gives explicit permission, reinforcing its privacy-first stance in contrast to cloud-reliant competitors. Software tools have also seen major upgrades, particularly for developers. Xcode now includes built-in support for AI-assisted programming, offering suggestions, debugging help, and code testing with support for external models as well. This move appears designed to lower the barrier for building apps that incorporate Apple Intelligence, even for smaller development teams. Beyond the system-wide updates, a range of feature-focused additions have been announced. A new dedicated Games app will act as a central hub for players, bringing together installed titles, achievements, leaderboards, and a social layer that enables users to see what friends are playing and initiate multiplayer sessions. The app introduces score-based challenges and makes it easier to manage and discover gaming content across Apple platforms. Other systems are receiving their own tailored improvements. macOS 26, nicknamed Tahoe, brings AI enhancements to Shortcuts, enabling faster automation and task execution. On iPad, new features such as Preview and markup tools offer users greater flexibility for editing and exporting visual content, particularly when using Apple Pencil. The Apple Watch gains new gesture-based controls and a Workout Buddy function that uses on-device intelligence to track fitness in a more personalized way. Apple TV now supports profile switching upon wake, a karaoke feature, and a refreshed Liquid Glass layout that simplifies navigation. VisionOS, designed for Apple’s AR/VR headset, will support additional accessories, including Logitech’s Muse stylus and Sony’s VR2 controller, expanding the input options for immersive experiences. Even Apple’s peripheral services saw meaningful updates. AirPods will now support higher-quality audio recording and offer remote camera control, while CarPlay users gain message pinning, live activities, and interactive widgets. Apple Wallet introduces new travel features, Maps learns regular commute patterns, and iMessage adds polling tools and enhanced customization for chats. While the presentation lacked the theatrics that often accompany major hardware reveals, Apple’s software direction this year carries significant weight. Instead of relying on spectacle, the company has chosen to embed progress more subtly into the everyday user experience, combining design, intelligence, and cross-platform coherence in a way that suggests quiet confidence rather than urgency.

The support list for macOS Tahoe still includes Intel Macs, but it's been whittled down to just four models, all released in 2019 or 2020. We speculated that this meant that the end was near for Intel Macs, and now we can confirm just how near it is: macOS Tahoe will be the last new macOS release to support any Intel Macs. All new releases starting with macOS 27 will require an Apple Silicon Mac. Apple will provide additional security updates for Tahoe until fall 2028, two years after it is replaced with macOS 27. That's a typical schedule for older macOS versions, which all get one year of major point updates that include security fixes and new features, followed by two years of security-only updates to keep them patched but no longer receive new features. Apple is also planning changes to Rosetta 2, the Intel-to-Arm app translation technology created to ease the transition between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. Rosetta will continue to work as a general-purpose app translation tool in both macOS 26 and macOS 27.Read full article Comments",

Apple, which has been facing pressure to stake out its own pole position in the Big Tech artificial intelligence arms race, may not see that pressure abate anytime soon. [contact-form-7] On Monday (June 9), the company’s much anticipated 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) saw the reveal of new features for Apple Intelligence, the Cupertino giant’s privacy-centric, on-device AI framework that spans iPhones, iPads, Macs and Vision Pro. Despite the breadth of its rollout, the underlying strategy underscores a fundamental tension. Apple is betting that measured integration, meticulous design and a deep commitment to user privacy will matter more than rapid innovation in generative AI. Investors were less convinced, with the company’s stock closing down 1.2% for the day. Apple, long known for excitement and innovation, delivered nothing particularly exciting or innovative during the first day of the WWDC. Regarding an upgrade to the long-standing Siri AI voice assistant, Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the company needed “more time to meet our high-quality bar,” The Wall Street Journal reported. This restrained approach stands in contrast to rivals like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which are embracing large language models and enterprise-scale AI solutions in aggressive and sometimes experimental ways. While those companies are deploying AI agents in business software and cloud infrastructure, Apple is offering tightly integrated, narrowly scoped capabilities such as real-time voicemail transcripts, enhanced Spotlight search, call screening and translation. The question observers may find themselves asking is whether Apple is playing a longer game or simply falling behind. Read also: Why Generative AI Is a Bigger Threat to Apple Than Google or Amazon Is Apple’s Conservative AI Gambit a Strategic Edge or Missed Opportunity? Apple’s core value proposition with AI is intelligence without surveillance. Most new features announced at WWDC are processed on-device, with Apple promising that user data will never be harvested for training purposes. In an era of heightened regulatory scrutiny and consumer distrust, this stance resonates. However, the limitations are equally apparent. On-device models are necessarily smaller and less powerful than the sprawling models hosted in the cloud. This design choice limits the sophistication of Apple’s offerings, particularly for enterprise use cases that may require deeper contextual reasoning, custom training and real-time collaboration across users and systems. Apple’s Foundation Models Framework, introduced at WWDC, is a step toward opening its AI infrastructure to third-party developers. However, for developers building serious enterprise applications — from legal document review to customer support automation — Apple’s AI stack may be insufficient, The Wall Street Journal reported. In the context of the broader AI economy, Apple risks strategic drift. Most enterprise AI innovation is happening in the cloud, powered by APIs and platforms that allow fine-tuning, multi-modal inputs and integration with vast data sets. Apple’s refusal to enter this space leaves it reliant on consumer hardware cycles and developer goodwill — both of which may wane as competitors offer richer, more adaptable platforms. See also: Apple Faces Mounting Challenges as Stock Slumps Apple’s Long Game Isn’t Paying Off in the Short Term PYMNTS CEO and connected economy expert Karen Webster was among the first to highlight these challenges in a May 2023 piece just as AI was beginning to scale. “Cupertino’s stance on privacy and user data, and its closed ecosystem, may have Apple winning the hearts and minds of consumers but losing the generative AI war, despite having a 58% share of the U.S. smartphone market to Android’s 42%,” Webster wrote. “Unless something changes, Apple may end up playing the role of smartphone, mobile OS and App Store, just like it does today — with an App Store that comes chock-full of everyone else’s GPT app innovations.” Apple attempted to deflect some criticism with a redesign of its software ecosystem. Dubbed Liquid Glass, the new user interface across iOS, iPadOS and macOS features translucent, layered interfaces meant to evoke the coming of a “Glasswing” iPhone in 2027, Bloomberg reported. These visual updates underscore Apple’s traditional strength in design rather than transformative AI innovation. However, AI is just one of several concerns. The company also faces tariffs that threaten its hardware profit margins. President Donald Trump is also pressuring Apple to alter its overseas production model — a supply chain strategy the company has employed for decades. Meanwhile, the company’s services division, which drives gross profit margins of 74%, is facing legal scrutiny. Questions surround App Store fees and payments Apple gets from Google for being its default search engine. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

On Monday, Apple announced a series of incremental Apple Intelligence updates at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, focusing on practical features like live phone call translation and visual search rather than the ambitious race for AI breakthroughs that rivals have been promoting. Notably absent was any concrete update on the much-needed \"more personalized\" Siri that Apple first announced at last year's WWDC but has yet to demo publicly or provide specifics about. (Siri still feels woefully outdated after using ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode, for example.) In our WWDC keynote preview from last week, we pointed out that Apple has faced intense pressure to deliver on AI after overpromising features it wasn't ready to launch—a controversy that led to an executive reshuffle of those handling Apple's AI efforts.Read full article Comments",

It extends across Apple's other devices too: It'll be available later this fall in software updates for Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.With a translucent, glass-like aesthetic, the Liquid Glass design adapts in different environments based on content and context and is coming to everything from switches and sliders to the iPhone's home screen and control center.More Visual Intelligence featuresNew Visual Intelligence capabilities will come up when you take a screenshot.AppleIf you have an iPhone that's powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, there are some new Visual Intelligence features coming that can tell what's on your screen to help you take various actions.If you're scrolling on social media, for example, and you find a product you like, you can press the same buttons you'd press to take a screenshot, and a new option will offer Visual Intelligence capabilities, including searching sites like Google and Etsy for the product to buy. (Android users familiar with Google's Lens AI tool have enjoyed a similar feature for a bit now.)You can also ask ChatGPT about what you see on your screen, or if you come across an event, you can add it to your calendar, prepopulated with the date, time, and location.Big improvements to your group chatsPolls is one of several new features coming to the Messages app.AppleMessages also get an upgrade in iOS 26.

        "description": "Almost every article you’re going to read about Apple’s just-announced iOS 26 operating system for the iPhone is going to focus on its new “Liquid Glass” design. And don’t get me wrong—that design certainly looks refreshing (and is strangely reminiscent of the wax soda bottle candies I loved as a kid). iOS 26’s Liquid Glass interface features transparent and reflective UI elements that allow the content behind buttons, toolbars, and icons to show through. But what I’m most excited about, when it comes to iOS 26, is something else. It’s a lot less flashy, but it’s arguably more useful to the 90% of iPhone users out there who couldn’t care less about the new look, or artificial intelligence improvements, for that matter. I’m talking about the people who still use their iPhone as a phone. You know…to make phone calls. Because iOS 26 includes the most significant upgrades to the actual phone call functions of the iPhone we’ve seen in years—and it’s about time. iOS 26’s new design is nice—but not waiting on hold is nicer We’ve all been there: calling the bank or doctor’s office or customer service hotline only to be immediately placed on hold, listening to the same background music for what seems like an eternity, waiting for an actual human being to pick up at the other end. If there’s one experience that will put even the most patient person in a foul mood—this is it. [Photo: Apple] That’s why a new feature of the Phone app in iOS 26 is my favorite feature out of all the new ones Apple announced today. Called “Hold Assist,” it solves a real-world problem nearly every iPhone user—scratch that, any phone user since the dawn of the telephone era—has faced. With Hold Assist in iOS 26, you never need to wait on hold again. Now, when you call a phone number and are placed on hold, you can tell your iPhone to stay on the line and wait for you instead of having to do it yourself. The iPhone will kill the hold music and allow you to continue using your device as normal, alerting you as soon as a live person comes on the line. Extra bonus: not having to wait on hold for hours means no more hearing that hold music playing in your head at night while trying to fall asleep. Who’s calling and why? Let your iPhone worry about that Another drawback of telephones is that anyone with your number can call you—including cold callers, spammers, and bill collectors. Oftentimes, these people will try to obfuscate their phone numbers, so you need to pick up to see who is on the other end of the line. But that’s where another great new feature of the Phone app comes in: Call Screening. [Photo: Apple] In iOS 26, if the phone app receives a call from an unknown caller, it will answer the call itself—your phone won’t even ring. The iPhone will then wait until the caller has shared their name and the reason for their phone call. Only then will it let your iPhone ring. When it does, you’ll see the name of he person and the reason for their call displayed on your screen, enabling you to decide if you want to pick up the call or give it a miss. This feature takes the anxiety and uncertainty out of answering phone calls—something nearly everyone has felt at some point. Making the “phone” in “smartphone” great again In addition to Hold Assist and Call Screening, iOS 26 is also adding several other new features to the Phone app, including the ability to live translate a phone call with someone who speaks another language into the language you speak, and a completely redesigned calls screen that makes it easier to see your recent calls and quickly make a call to your favorite contacts. And, yeah, I get it: being excited about these kinds of features seems a bit baffling. After all, it’s 2025, and making calls on a phone feels so twentieth-century. Our phones are now internet browsers, cameras, gaming devices, and AI assistants. But companies have focused on innovating those modern features of the smartphone for so long, they’ve often neglected trying to improve the main thing our phones were initially designed for. Despite the amazing capabilities of our phones in the twenty-first century, the need to make and receive phone calls has not gone away. Not everyone uses their phone to converse with a chatbot, edit videos, or manage their wallets, but nearly everyone still relies on it to make calls. So, while it may seem like a dull area for innovation, the calling experience remains one of the most universally used aspects of our phones, and therefore anything that improves upon it is something worth picking up for. iOS 26 is now available for developers. The operating system will become available to general users as a free download this fall.",

        "description": "“At long last, Apple has finally entered the AI race.” That was the first line in my story about Apple’s announcements at WWDC 2024, almost exactly one year ago from today. After the company announced a bunch of highly personalized AI features last June, Apple seemed poised to finally reap the rewards of its long-time effort to build trust around user data privacy. At last year’s WWDC, Apple software head Craig Fedherighi said the company intends to offer “a personal intelligence model” on users’ phones that “draws on personal context.” Apple, it seemed, was finally going to leverage its considerable strengths and deliver proactive AI features that leverage the user’s own personal data. But 12 months later, that still hasn’t come to fruition. Fedherighi said early on in today’s WWDC 2025 keynote that the AI personalization features, which tap into private user data to offer proactive AI-generated insights, had failed to reach Apple’s “high bar” for quality. More announcements on that front, he added, would arrive “in the coming year.” Meanwhile, the world outside Cupertino moves on, and the generative AI boom continues to accelerate. After last year’s keynote, this year’s presentation felt like a throwback to years past, with Fedherigi and friends running through a litany of modest UX and feature upgrades to iOS and the other Apple operating systems. In iOS, they showed us a breezy new UX look (featuring translucent app and widget panels), refreshed icon design, a live translation feature, ﻿﻿and “Mixmoji” (combine two existing emoji into one!), etc. There’s also a new AI‑powered 3D effect that shifts a lock screen image’s perspective as the user tilts their phone. (Didn’t the ill-fated Amazon Fire phone do that?) There were also some updates to the AI Visual Intelligence features announced last year. iPhone users can already tap on real-world objects via their phone camera to get more information. Now, they can do the same within any app, including social media, to identify and learn about objects—and in some cases, on where to buy the items. The screenshot interface now lets users search for items within the image or ask ChatGPT deeper questions about them. (Google announced the addition of on-screen object search earlier this year.) But while Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are integrating their AI models with users’ personal and professional data, Apple seems stuck in neutral Apple had every opportunity to own personal AI. It had a big head start with the acquisition of Siri way back in 2010. It controls billions of devices, it designs the chips, and it has the trust of billions of consumers. And Apple users already store a wealth of personal data on their phones, which the company could leverage to offer a personal assistant with an intimate knowledge of the user. Instead, while Apple talks about new icons and Genmoji, OpenAI continues embedding itself deeper into consumer workflows and digital habits. ChatGPT is learning users’ tastes, preferences, and memory. And now, Apple’s former design guru is helping OpenAI build a hardware device that could harness all that power. I was optimistic when Apple hired John Giannandrea from Google in April 2018 to lead its machine learning and AI strategy. Reporting directly to Tim Cook, he seemed like the right person to inject new life into Apple’s AI ambitions. After all, transformer models—the foundation of the generative AI revolution—were invented at Google while Giannandrea was still there in 2017. They sparked immense excitement and innovation at Google, and I hoped he’d bring that same energy to Apple, baking it into core products like the still-lagging Siri. He didn’t. Giannandrea still leads Apple’s “core AI” division, but Siri and robotics have since been moved out from under his leadership. Still, that’s not to say Apple is anything close to cooked. The company makes the biggest and best smartphone in the world, and will for a long time. And it sells digital services through its devices better than anyone else. Still it’s worrying that it doesn’t seem to be acting with the urgency that the moment demands. The next big thing is here, and Apple isn’t at the forefront. Separately, Apple researchers released a widely discussed paper over the weekend that calls into question whether new “large reasoning models” are capable of the kind of cognitive function that could lead to artificial general intelligence, where the AI performs as well or better than humans at most tasks.",

Every year, Apple releases new versions of iOS and iPadOS, and most years those updates also end support for a handful of devices that are too old or too slow or otherwise incapable of running the new software. Though this year's macOS 26 Tahoe release was unkind to Intel Macs, the iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 releases are more generous, dropping support for just two iPhone models and a single iPad. The iOS 26 update won't run on 2018's iPhone XR or XS, and iPadOS 26 won't run on 2019's 7th-generation iPad. Any other device that can currently run iOS or iPadOS 18 will be able to upgrade to the new versions and pick up the new Liquid Glass look, among other features. Everything that runs iOS 26. Credit: Apple Everything that runs iPadOS 26. Credit: Apple Apple never provides explicit reasoning for why it drops the devices it drops, though they can usually be explained by some combination of age and technical capability. The 7th-gen iPad, for example, was still using a 2017-vintage Apple A10X chip despite being introduced a number of years later.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Apple’s finally making it easier to remember the name of its latest operating system. After naming its iOS sequentially from iOS 1 in 2007 to iOS 18 last year, Apple announced that it would now name its latest operating system after the current year. What would have been iOS 19 is now iOS 26, since the system, which comes out this year, will be good through fall 2026. The new year-based names applies to Apple’s iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. The rebrand brings Apple operating system names in line with the conventions of other industries, like automakers (the 2026 Ford F-150) and sports franchise video games (“Madden NFL 2026”). And it’s also a smart branding play since it keeps things simple. The names of the company’s ever-changing hardware and software updates can become a jumble of numbers over time. By naming it after the upcoming year, knowing the latest iOS update is as easy as knowing the date. The company made the announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), confirming a Bloomberg report last month about the change, but what Apple didn’t say was that it will change what it calls its hardware. Its latest iPhone model is the iPhone 16, and the company hasn’t made any indication it’s rebranding the smartphone or other products to year-based names. The care Apple takes in naming in products, services, and applications, though, mirrors the simple, intuitive design of its software and hardware. It’s meant to make sense, and competitors take notice. Dell this year adopted “Pro” and “Max” suffixes for its new laptop names, which Apple also uses in product names.",

        "description": "All Intel MacBook Airs and Mac minis are gone; just a few other models remain. Apple's new macOS Tahoe release isn't the end of the road for Intel Macs, but it sends Apple's clearest signal yet that it's nearly finished with the Intel Mac era. The macOS 26 update will support just four Intel Macs, all released in 2019 or 2020, and it entirely drops support for all Intel versions of the MacBook Air and Mac mini. Other models that run the current macOS 15 Sequoia release that won't support macOS Tahoe include all 15-inch MacBook Pros, all 13-inch MacBook Pros with two Thunderbolt ports, and the 4K and 5K versions of the 2019 iMac. The compatibility list for macOS 26 Tahoe. Credit: Apple Apple has generally been pulling support for new macOS releases from Intel Macs more aggressively than it was in the mid-to-late 2010s, giving most systems six-ish years of new macOS releases followed by another two years of security updates. Some models fared better than others; for example, Intel MacBook Air models have been getting dropped more aggressively than MacBook Pros.Read full article Comments",

As part of a wider software rebranding effort, Apple's visionOS is jumping from version 2 to 26 with a new software update announced during the company's developer conference this week. visionOS 26 will reach Vision Pro users later this year, and it focuses on refining the focus of the device based on how users are actually using it rather than whatever wild ideas the company had during its initial development—including addressing common complaints about how the Vision Pro doesn't support some features of popular competing mixed-reality headsets. For example, the headset will soon support native playback of 3D video recorded by people other than Apple and downloaded from anywhere on the Internet—something you had to use a few, somewhat janky third-party apps to do until now, but which is an easier-to-access feature of some other mixed-reality headsets.Read full article Comments",

Codenamed Tahoe, macOS 26 gets a visual refresh with the same \"Liquid Glass\" look that Apple is introducing across all of its operating systems this year. Apple has also changed the version number, jumping directly from version 14 to version 26 as it shifts to unified year-based version numbering across all of its operating systems. Liquid Glass goes all-in on translucency and transparency, changing the look of icons and windows across the operating system. Most significantly, the macOS menu bar has become entirely invisible, and the Control Center has adopted a new, glassy, translucent appearance. The same color-tinting customization features available on iOS and iPadOS are coming to the Mac this year, giving users multiple customization options on top of the standard light and dark modes and accent colors. The invisible menu bar and glassy Control Center in macOS Tahoe. Credit: Apple The new look will probably define the release in the minds of most users, but it's bringing the standard handful of new features and refinements across the built-in apps. For the Finder, folders can be customized with colors and emoji labels to help them stand out from a big list of folders.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "New Challenges feature allows for high score competitions with friends. At its Worldwide Developer Conference today, Apple unveiled a new iOS Games App that Apple Senior Director of Marketplace Platforms and Technologies Ann Thai promoted as \"a new destination to help you get more out of your games.\" The most relevant new social feature in the app comes in the \"Play Together\" tab, which provides a quick look at what your friends are playing on iOS. That tab will also integrate a new Challenges feature, which game developers can use to turn single-player games into score-based competitions between friends. These interpersonal Challenges come on top of the standard game leaderboards already common through iOS's Game Center, allowing for a new way to compete socially. Other than that, the new Games app seems to consolidate several features that were previously split between Game Center and the App Store. On the Home tab, the Games app will let you see games with new update, time-sensitive in-game events, and recommendations for new games to try. A Library tab will show every iOS game you've ever downloaded in a single place, while the Apple Arcade tab shows subscribers what's available to download. The Games app will work in both portrait and landscape mode and be navigable via controller.Read full article Comments",

The latest large reasoning models (LRMs) experience “complete accuracy collapse” when faced with highly complex tasks, according to a new paper co-authored by researchers from Apple. [contact-form-7] These artificial intelligent (AI) models outperform standard models on some problems but do no better when problems get too complicated. LRMs are trained to solve complex problems by showing them how to “think” step-by-step, just like a person might work through a puzzle. They generate detailed internal “thinking processes” before giving an answer, which has led to better performance on many tests. But the new paper suggests these advanced AI models might hit a wall. The report indicates that even these models collapse completely in performance when faced with problems that go beyond a certain level of complexity. The researchers wanted to look inside how these models operate, not just at their final answers. They felt that standard tests for AI performance might not tell the whole story, possibly because the AI had already seen similar problems during training. Researchers used controllable puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi, Checkers Jumping, River Crossing and Blocks World, allowing them precise control over the difficulty of the puzzles by adding more disks, checkers, people or blocks, while keeping the basic rules the same. This allowed them to see exactly when and how the AI’s reasoning broke down as problems got harder. As puzzle complexity increased, the performance of these frontier LRMs didn’t just get a little worse; it suffered a “complete accuracy collapse,” often dropping to zero successful solutions beyond a certain point. The researchers found that as the problems approached the point where the AI started failing, the LRMs began to reduce their reasoning effort, using fewer “thinking” steps or tokens, pointing to a fundamental limit in how they handle increasing difficulty. On simple problems, the LRMs sometimes found the correct answer early but kept exploring wrong solutions — a form of “overthinking” that wastes effort. On harder problems, correct solutions appeared later, if at all. Beyond the collapse point, no correct solutions were found in the thinking process. The study concluded that these findings point to fundamental limitations in how current LRMs tackle problems. While the “thinking” process helps delay failure, it doesn’t overcome these core barriers. The research raises questions about whether simply adding more “thinking” steps is enough to achieve truly general AI that can handle highly complex, novel problems.

        "description": "In addition to inflation and US-China trade, a key bond auction is on investors' radar. A $22 billion sale of 30-year bonds is scheduled for Thursday. Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThere's a handful of potentially market-moving events on the calendar this week. US-China trade talks and May inflation data will be the highest-profile events for traders. Apple's WWDC will shed light on the company's supply chain and AI strategy.Investors will be monitoring a host of potentially market-moving events this week, with updates due on trade and inflation, while Apple kicks off a highly anticipated product event. Recession fears have edged down after the turmoil that racked markets earlier in the spring, but the market is still struggling with uncertainty regarding President Donald Trump's trade policies and their implications for the economy. While last week's jobs report showed a solid labor market, investors are monitoring how the inflation side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate fares this week, and how it will influence the rate-cut outlook for the year. Meanwhile, Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will provide insight into not only new software updates but also the future of the AI race among mega-cap tech companies.Here's what investors are watching this week. US-China trade talksAfter last week's phone call between Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping, China and US trade officials are meeting in London on Monday for two days of trade negotiations. Last month's trade talks were key to calming recession fears and helped propel the S&P 500 to its highest levels since February, but concerns still remain. The biggest negotiation topic will be over China's exports of rare earth metals, which are critical components in manufacturing semiconductors, smartphones, and other technologies.Continued improvements in trade relations between the two countries will be critical to reducing volatility in the market and could shed clarity on the direction of tariff rates.CPI dataThe consumer price index for May will be released on Wednesday. Last month's reading of 2.3% was fairly benign, but investors will continue to watch for signs of Trump's tariffs showing up in the hard data.Importantly, the reading will be key in determining the Fed's next move. The median forecast is for annual consumer inflation to have risen 2.5% last month. Meanwhile, expectations for the June 17 Fed meeting are for officials to keep interest rates unchanged.\"The big surprise could be how little Trump's tariffs are boosting inflation despite upward pressures on prices-paid and prices-received indexes in the Fed's regional business surveys,\" wrote on Sunday. Yet, some strategists have predicted that inflation will pick up in the back half of this year, spurring stagflation concerns. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment will get a fresh reading on Friday. Sentiment has been low as Americans feel pessimistic about tariffs, though hard data that the Fed looks at has held up. Apple's Worldwide Developers ConferenceAll eyes will be on Apple this week as it kicks off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company is expected to unveil new AI features embedded in iOS 19.The conference will be an opportunity for Apple to address several headwinds it has faced this year.\"In a nutshell WWDC is a pivotal moment in Apple's future as the developers are the hearts and lungs of the Cupertino growth story with the Street being laser-focused on Apple today,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote. The tech giant has trailed peers like Microsoft and Google in the AI race, and its stock has taken a beating this year as the worst-performing Magnificent Seven member, largely due to concerns about tariffs and iPhone production. Last month, Trump threatened a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones not made in the US.Investors will be looking for updates on Apple Intelligence as well, as the company's AI offering has been underwhelming to Wall Street.A key bond auctionThe US Treasury sells a lot of bonds, and usually the sale is unremarkable for markets. However, with deficit concerns running high as the GOP budget bill moves through Congress, a $22 billion auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday could move the market if demand appears weak. A weak sale of 20-year bonds last month rattled markets and sent yields surging, and all eyes are on this week's sale as a potential investor referendum on the sweeping tax and spending bill.

While WWDC is historically a developer-focused conference, where programmers who create iPhone, Mac, and iPad apps can attend online sessions to learn about Apple’s latest software technologies, it is also an event that draws significant interest from consumers and the media. That’s because Apple kicks off each WWDC with a keynote presentation, in which the company showcases its upcoming software—the operating systems that power its devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and more. These operating systems will be previewed for the first time today before they become available to the general public in the fall. Fast Company has a detailed report on the software announcements and features that Apple is expected to make at today’s WWDC25 keynote. All of the company’s operating systems are expected to get a visual design overhaul—the most radical in years. The operating systems Apple is expected to reveal include iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26. You can see those announcements by watching the WWDC25 keynote when Apple broadcasts it later today. Here’s how. What time is Apple’s WWDC 25 keynote? Apple’s 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference keynote takes place today, Monday, June 9, 2025. The keynote starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Here’s how that time translates into times in other time zones around the world: Hawaii Standard Time (HST): 7:00 AM Pacific Time (PT): 10:00 AM Mountain Time (MT): 11:00 AM Central Time (CT): 12:00 PM Eastern Time (ET): 1:00 PM GMT (Greenwich Mean Time): 6:00 PM CET (Central European Time): 7:00 PM EEST (Eastern European Summer Time): 8:00 PM MSK (Moscow Standard Time): 8:00 PM IST (Indian Standard Time): 10:30 PM ICT (Indochina Time): 11:00 PM CST (China Standard Time): 1:00 AM (June 10) JST (Japan Standard Time): 2:00 AM (June 10) AWST (Western Australia Standard Time): 2:00 AM (June 10) AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time): 3:00 AM (June 10) NZST (New Zealand Standard Time): 5:00 AM (June 10) How can I live stream Apple’s WWDC 25 keynote?

        "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook used the company's developer event to unveil its Apple Intelligence plans in 2024. This year, it seems unlikely we'll get a major new product announcement from the event.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple often uses its annual developers conference to launch major new products.That doesn't seem likely this year.Instead, expect people to spend a lot of time focusing on Apple's weak points — exactly what CEO Tim Cook doesn't want.Apple kicks off its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday — traditionally an event where the company tries to woo developers, users, and Wall Street all at once.Maybe that will happen this time around. But only because expectations are so low: Apple is limping into this year beset with all kinds of problems, from many directions, and it's not clear how it's going to work its way out from them.Let's get this part out of the way at the top: You, a normal person, are unlikely to care about anything Apple announces at WWDC this week.Two years ago, Apple used the event to unveil its Vision Pro headset; last year, it showed off Apple Intelligence, its entry into the AI wars. Forget the fact that both of those products underwhelmed once they launched — they were at least something new for Apple to talk about.But barring a surprise, it doesn't look like there will be any major new unveilings at WWDC this week. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who is exceptionally dialed into Apple, has a preview of what's on tap and it all seems underwhelming: Even the most ardent Apple fans are unlikely to be excited about new interfaces, icons, and names.And while Apple is scrambling to catch up in AI — turns out a bunch of the stuff it showed off last year has yet to actually materialize — it won't have much progress to announce this week. Gurman predicts that Apple's AI announcements \"will be surprisingly minor and are unlikely to impress industry watchers, especially considering the rapid pace of innovation\" from the likes of Google, Meta, and OpenAI.All of which means people watching and thinking and talking about Apple may likely end up focusing on Apple's problems, instead of its promise. Not a place Tim Cook wants to be — and not where investors want him to be, which is why Apple stock is down more than 18% in 2025. Here's a look at what he's facing right now:Tariff trouble: Exactly how much will Apple have to pay to bring in new phones and other gadgets to the US from China? And what happens if they shift production — or at least final assembly — of those products to India or Vietnam? Who knows? Donald Trump's tariff policies remain fluid at best.Trump continues to insist that he wants Apple to build its products in the US — regardless of whether that's possible — and the spectre of some kind of Trump-imposed tax that makes Apple products much more expensive remains a real possibility.AI angst: Apple has two very big problems when it comes to AI. As my colleague Alistair Barr points out, Apple's competitors have long, long leads in AI research, and it's unclear if Apple will ever be able to keep up. Right now, it can't even provide working versions of stuff it showed off a year ago.There's a possible future where Apple does just fine not having cutting-edge AI because it can simply use its massive distribution advantage — a billion-plus Apple devices in people's pockets. But being wholly dependent on other people for tech that's supposed to be table stakes in a few years isn't a great place to be.Government headaches: Regulators around the world have been lining up to take a crack at Apple — including the US Department of Justice, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company a year ago. (A separate federal antitrust against Google could also hurt Apple, by potentially ending a long-standing deal where Google pays Apple more than $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on iPhones.)Apple's most persistent foe seems to be the European Union, which has come out with a series of rulings and judgments against Apple. Some of these don't seem crucial to Apple's future — see, for instance, its move to change the charging ports on its phone to adapt to an EU mandate a few years ago.But Apple says an EU ruling forcing it to change the way it runs it powerful App Store is \"yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,\" and is pushing back as hard as it can. (It's also hoping that Donald Trump's administration will come to its aid.)Developers, developers, developers: Europeans aren't the only ones complaining about the way Apple runs its App Store. It continues to hear from a loud contingent of developers who complain that Apple's rules around its store unfairly hamper their business. In the case of Fortnite-maker Epic Games, that kicked off a legal fight that started in 2020, and took a sharp turn earlier this year when a US judge ruled that Apple had to allow developers to tell users they could buy stuff from them without going through the App Store — a move that could threaten a huge stream of revenue for Apple.But the app store also generates a vibes problem for Apple, with high-profile critics like Apple blogger John Gruber arguing that Apple has gone from courting developers to making it hard for them to make a living. Apple is most definitely sensitive to that criticism, which is why it often puts out press releases pointing out how much money developers make by selling stuff via Apple. (Its newest release puts that number at $1.3 trillion in 2024 alone.)And this week's event, remember, has the word \"developer\" in the title, so you can expect Apple to continue to insist that it's on the software guys' side. Don't be surprised if you hear from folks who feel otherwise.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple CEO Tim Cook used the company's developer event to unveil its Apple Intelligence plans in 2024.

        "description": "Apple has thrown a spanner into one of artificial intelligence’s most hyped developments. A new internal study suggests that so-called \"reasoning\" models—AI systems designed to emulate step-by-step human thought—are far less capable than the industry might have hoped. Published under the title The Illusion of Thinking, the paper from Apple’s machine learning team provides a comprehensive critique of reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs). These are versions of AI that attempt to solve problems by simulating multi-step logic. But when put through their paces, the study suggests, these models often collapse under pressure. Thinking Isn’t Always Smarter Apple’s researchers tested various models on puzzle-based tasks, where the difficulty could be precisely increased. The puzzles were chosen because they demand logical thinking and can’t be solved simply by guessing what “looks right.” Performance was grouped into three categories: Simple Tasks: Basic models, without added reasoning chains, often performed better. They solved easier problems faster and more accurately. Intermediate Tasks: This is the sweet spot for reasoning models. They showed some improvement over regular LLMs—but only briefly. Complex Tasks: Once tasks became genuinely difficult, all models failed. Crucially, the ones built to reason did not just struggle—they regressed, producing weaker output and fewer steps of thought. What stood out most was the unexpected drop in performance as complexity increased. Rather than ramping up their reasoning to meet the challenge, models began to offer less reasoning altogether. This suggests that their thinking ability may be more cosmetic than structural. A Closer Look at the Cracks In one test, models were asked to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle—an old logic game familiar to anyone who’s studied basic computer science. With just a few discs, most models performed fine. But as the number of discs increased, success rates plunged. Even when fed the exact algorithm, models couldn’t reliably carry it out. The issue wasn’t memory or compute limits. These AI systems had room to process more steps. They simply didn’t. In many cases, they stopped reasoning halfway through, abandoned logic midstream, or returned to earlier incorrect ideas. Even a slight change in the way a question was worded could break their performance. This behaviour hints at a deeper limitation. Rather than working through a problem logically, as humans might, these models appear to rely on surface-level pattern matching. The reasoning traces they output may look convincing—but Apple’s paper found they often have little to do with how the final answer is reached. Models That Overthink and Underdeliver One striking insight was how often models veered off course after finding a correct solution. Instead of stopping there, they kept going—sometimes reversing their own correct steps. This phenomenon, known as \"overthinking,\" resulted in answers being buried under layers of unnecessary logic. Researchers noted a sharp divide depending on problem complexity. In easier puzzles, models often solved the task early, then talked themselves out of it. In mid-range puzzles, they wandered through trial and error before arriving at a partial answer. On the hardest tasks, correct solutions vanished entirely. In short, the more you ask these systems to think, the less helpful their thinking becomes. Not a Death Knell—But a Warning Bell Apple is not calling for the end of reasoning models. Instead, the report urges a rethink about what these systems actually do. It also warns developers and businesses not to assume that “more thought” from a model automatically equals better results. “Reasoning models aren’t useless,” one senior researcher said, “but their strengths are very specific—and their weaknesses are too often overlooked.” This message lands at a sensitive moment. As rivals like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI rush to build general-purpose AI systems that reason, plan and even argue, Apple is taking a different path. Its AI focus remains grounded in efficient, privacy-first features that run on users’ devices. The company’s new Apple Intelligence tools—rolled into iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia—emphasise helpfulness over generality. Features like writing suggestions, notification summaries and image generation aim to make day-to-day tasks smoother, not to mimic human reasoning. Between Promise and Premature Praise While some in the AI community have welcomed Apple’s study as a much-needed reality check, others see it as overly cautious. Critics point out that reasoning models are still in their infancy and argue that dismissing their progress so early could limit innovation. But Apple’s data is hard to ignore. The company’s researchers did not rely on abstract benchmarks or vague tasks. They built controlled environments, adjusted puzzle complexity step by step, and measured not only answers but the logic behind them. The result is a study that asks one key question: if today’s AI still stumbles on problems that children—or even simple algorithms—can solve, how close are we really to machines that think? For now, it seems, the illusion of reasoning may be just that—an illusion.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Tracking the World’s Clicks: Daily Rankings of Top Search Platforms",

        "description": "A Tim Sweeney interview sheds light on Epic Games' approach to Fortnite's evolution as a creator platform — and comparisons to YouTube. Is Fortnite the next YouTube? Perhaps — but Epic Games has higher aspirations. As Fortnite evolves from a popular video game into a robust ecosystem of creators, brands and virtual worlds, some observers have begun to compare Fortnite to other creator platforms, like YouTube. These comparisons have only grown as Epic Games continues to build out its creator tools, including expanded data collection tools and AI-enabled coding assistants that were unveiled at last week’s Unreal Fest conference in Orlando, Florida. Although Epic Games’ leadership appreciates the parallels, CEO Tim Sweeney has mixed feelings about the analogy. He views Fortnite’s ongoing push to onboard creators as a stage of the platform’s evolution, rather than a means to an end. Epic Games is trying to build the metaverse, per Sweeney, rather than just create a destination for creators to entertain audiences and generate revenue.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

Apple is reportedly floundering in its attempt to upgrade its artificial intelligence (AI) voice assistant. [contact-form-7] The tech giant is holding its annual event this week, though investors are pessimistic about the chances of a major AI announcement, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (June 8). Recently departed employees told FT that Apple has been hit by challenges with updating Siri with the use of cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) that can provide more sophisticated responses to spoken prompts. Apple has been trying to develop its own LLMs over the machine learning technology that powers Siri, a product used in hundreds of millions of its bestselling devices, to create a truly conversational assistant. Former executives said that the process of integrating the technologies has led to bugs, something rivals like OpenAI did not face when building generative AI-based voice assistants. “It was obvious that you were not going to revamp Siri by doing what executives called ‘climbing the hill,’” one former exec said, referring to the process of gradually developing the product instead of rebuilding it from scratch. “It’s clear that they stumbled.” The FT also noted that updates to Siri form a major component of Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features announced at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year and designed to increase hardware sales. The report follows one from last week by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) about a host of problems facing Apple, leading to a 20% drop in its stock price, its worst performance in at least 15 years. Experts expect the WWDC to demonstrate how much Apple lags competitors in AI, that report said. While rivals such as Microsoft and Google have used their developer events to highlight rapid progress in AI, Apple’s event could highlight how far it still has to go in AI. “Apple will be much more cautious about overpromising and will refrain from showing features that aren’t yet ready for prime time,” said Craig Moffett of research firm MoffettNathanson. However, AI is just one of several concerns. The company also faces tariffs that threaten its hardware profit margins. President Donald Trump is also pressuring Apple to alter its overseas production model — a supply chain strategy the company has employed for decades. Meanwhile, the company’s services division, which drives gross profit margins of 74%, is facing legal scrutiny. Questions surround both App Store fees and payments Apple gets from Google for being its default search engine.

        "description": "Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference begins this Monday, June 9. Although the five-day event has historically been aimed at developers, Apple’s consumer fans generally can’t wait to tune in to the keynote address that kicks off the event. That’s when Apple offers the world the first preview of its upcoming software launches—the operating systems that will power its devices when they are released to the public as free downloads in the fall. This year, Apple’s software changes are likely to be more transformative than they’ve been in over a decade, radically reshaping the look of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac OSes. But just what will Apple reveal at WWDC25? Here’s what—and what not—to expect. Rebranded operating systems In late May, Bloomberg revealed that Apple will be rebranding its numbering scheme for all of its operating systems. They will no longer be numbered sequentially (for example, iOS 16, iOS 17, iOS 18). Instead, they will be numbered by year. For example, the new iOS Apple will introduce on Monday at WWDC25 will no longer be called iOS 19, and instead will be known as “iOS 26.” The “26” stands for the year 2026. Though Apple is debuting the new OS in 2025, it will remain the latest OS through fall 2026, and the “26” moniker signifies that. That means instead seeing iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3, expect Apple to debut iOS 16, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. Unified visual design Apple is also creating a unified visual look for all its operating systems. Currently, iOS and iPadOS are the only two Apple operating systems that look somewhat similar—macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS have distinct designs for their UI elements, such as windows and pop-up menus. However, the “26” version of the operating systems will establish a universal design across all of them. Fast Company has previously detailed what the design might look like: transparent UI elements that let the forms and colors of background content bleed through like light through a glass window, floating toolbars, reflective and shimmering lighting effects, rounder icons, glassy keyboards, and more. The new OSes are said to take heavy inspiration from the current visionOS, which powers the Apple Vision Pro. iOS 26 Apple will likely use iOS 26 in its WWDC25 keynote to showcase the radical design changes coming to all its operating systems before going into detail on other changes coming to its OS’es. But there’s not much known about what we can expect other than a few improvements, which include a dedicated gaming app, new accessibility features, and the addition of Stage Manager for iPhone, which will allow users to display iPhone apps on a monitor connected to the iPhone via its USB port. There will also likely be some Apple Intelligence improvements, but more on that below. iPadOS 26 The iPad’s new operating system will receive the same new visual redesign iOS 26 and Apple’s other OSes are getting. It will also receive the same accessibility upgrades and new gaming app that iOS 26 is getting. But Bloomberg reports that iPadOS could actually get more “Mac-like” this year. While the iPad’s hardware is nearly universally praised, users frequently criticize its software, which is little different than iOS, an operating system designed for a smartphone. However, users tend to think of their tablets as being closer to computers than phones—and this year, Apple is reportedly making iPadOS more like desktop software, rather than mobile. Bloomberg says that the iPadOS 26 “upgrade will focus on productivity, multitasking, and app window management—with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac.” macOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26 It not clear what new features Apple will reveal in the new operating systems for Mac, Apple TV, Vision Pro, and Apple Watch. But all of them are likely to adopt the new solarium-like visual design of iOS 26. And there’s a possibility that tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26 may also bring Apple Intelligence—Apple’s artificial intelligence platform—to the Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and Apple Watch for the first time. Yet, for the Apple Watch, Bloomberg reports the device may rely on offloading the actual processing of Apple Intelligence requests to a connected iPhone since the Apple Watch’s hardware lacks the processing power to run Apple Intelligence on-device. Apple Intelligence Last year’s event, WWDC24, focused heavily on Apple Intelligence. Yet, since the AI platform’s rollout in October, Apple’s foray into artificial intelligence has been met with indifference from most consumers. Apple also faced criticism for delaying previously announced Apple Intelligence changes to Siri until later this year—or even into 2026. For that reason, Apple isn’t expected to announce many new Apple Intelligence features. It won’t want to disappoint people if they again need to be delayed. However, there are reports that Apple will give users a few new Apple intelligence upgrades, including AI battery management on the iPhone and the option to select Google’s Gemini as the chatbot of choice in Apple Intelligence. Currently, the only third-party option Apple Intelligence offers is OpenAI’s ChatGPT. New Macs and iPhones? WWDC is historically a heavily software-focused event. So if you’re hoping to see new iPhones announced at WWDC25, expect to be let down. Apple will unveil its new iPhone range in the fall, as usual. But whether the new iPhone family will be called “iPhone 17” or instead will be rebranded as “iPhone 26” is yet to be seen. As for other hardware, there is an outside chance that Apple could unveil a new Mac Pro—its highest-end, professional desktop computer at WWDC25, since the event is still, ostensibly, one focused on professionals. The current Mac Pro was introduced at WWDC23 in June 2023, making it two years old this month. New Apple TV hardware is also a possibility, or that launch may wait until the fall. However, we won’t need to wait much longer to know for certain exactly what Apple will unveil at WWDC25. The conference kicks off on Monday, June 9, with the WWDC keynote scheduled for 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Can a visual redesign lead to an AAPL stock boost? The visual redesign may be the most significant announcement at WWDC from an investor perspective. Visual redesigns are eye-catching to even non-techie consumers, and they may spur buyers to spend on a shiny new iPhone—something investors are no doubt hoping for, as an increase in iPhone sales may help boost the company’s struggling stock. As of close on trading on June 6, Apple stock (Nasdaq: AAPL) has fallen over 18% since the beginning of the year. However, much of that stock price decline has little to do with Apple’s sales or financial fundamentals and is instead due to President Trump’s tariff threats against China and Apple itself. Apple sources a majority of its products from China, and any tariff that Trump implements on goods from the country could significantly impact Apple’s bottom line, despite Apple CEO Tim Cook’s best efforts. However, if you look at the entirety of the past 12 months, AAPL stock is still up nearly 5%, with the stock price just under $204. If the visual redesign of its operating systems indeed helps sell more iPhones and other devices, it could help the company’s shares move back in the direction of their all-time high of just over $260 apiece, reached in December 2024.",

Reporting before the keynote rarely captures everything that Apple has planned at its presentations, but the reliable information we've seen so far is that Apple will keep the focus on its software this year rather than using the keynote to demo splashy new hardware like the Vision Pro and Apple Silicon Mac Pro, which the company introduced at WWDC a couple years back.

While competitors like Microsoft and Google have used their own developer events to highlight rapid progress in AI, Apple’s event might underscore how far it still has to go in AI. Siri is long overdue for an AI revamp. Apple itself admitted recently that the upgrade is taking longer than anticipated. “Apple will be much more cautious about overpromising and will refrain from showing features that aren’t yet ready for prime time,” said Craig Moffett of research firm MoffettNathanson, according to the WSJ. More Outside Pressures However, AI is just one concern among several. The company is also facing tariffs that threaten its hardware profit margins. President Donald Trump also is pressuring Apple to change its overseas production model — a supply chain strategy the company has used for two decades. Meanwhile, the company’s services division, which delivers gross profit margins of 74%, is under legal scrutiny. Questions surround both App Store fees and payments Apple gets from Google for being its default search engine. “We caution that Apple has material risks to its revenue growth, margins and valuation multiple,” Needham analyst Laura Martin wrote in a report, downgrading the stock to “hold.” Unlike rivals Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which are monetizing AI tools, Apple isn’t charging for its generative AI features. This strategy could limit near-term upside as it tries to boost sales of core hardware, especially iPhones, which have seen flat revenue for two years. “We believe that, for this stock to work, it must have the catalyst of an iPhone replacement cycle, which we do not foresee in the next 12 months,” Martin added. Adding to the tension is competition from an unexpected place: OpenAI has teamed up with former Apple designer Jony Ive to develop “AI companions,” a potential new class of devices that could disrupt the smartphone-dominated landscape Apple helped create. Despite a loyal user base of 2.35 billion active devices, Apple’s dominance faces serious headwinds. Its AI delay is notable — but compared to the external risks of tariffs, legal battles and OpenAI’s new devices, this may be the only problem the company still fully controls, the WSJ said.

        "description": "Major announcements around the VisionPro headset are expected next week and may even confirm tantalizing rumors that a lighter model of the high-end XR device is coming next year. Whatever Apple reveals at WWDC, we can expect another round of analyst predictions that this time, mass adoption of head-mounted displays is finally happening. As Apple, Meta, and other major players continue to struggle with taking the technology mainstream, it’s worth addressing the virtual elephant in the room: There’s reason to suspect that XR headsets’ barrier to success isn’t just about cost, headset weight, lack of content, eye strain, or other frequently cited issues. Neuroscience suggests that the sensory experience of XR can’t compensate for the value of sharing a physical environment with our screens—especially when it comes to how we form knowledge and memory. Experiments with XR for Full-Time Computing About 10 years ago, I started spending long sessions in VR (4–8 hours daily over several weeks) to see how it might affect my sense of time and attention. I began with the HTC Vive, which was comfortable and fun. Later, I tested the Apple VisionPro with a full virtual workstation of monitors and displays. I was curious whether XR could improve focus and research. It felt like a very different thing to use VR all day, versus a brief demo in a museum or Apple showroom. Early on, I had to stand and move constantly throughout the day. It was exhausting, though it made for a great workout (SUPERHOT was one of my favorites). But this kind of motion-based interaction didn’t translate well to daily work tasks. Tossing data around in 3D like in Minority Report might make for compelling cinema, but it’s far less practical over time. When the VisionPro arrived, I was excited to use it while seated. A friend set me up with a massive virtual workspace, and I genuinely appreciated the focus it provided when I was digging into something new—say, reading a dense Wikipedia article. Still, when I set up my home office last year, I chose two large physical monitors at eye level and a sit/stand desk. As enjoyable as VR was, the process of setup and adjusting the space took more time and energy than docking a laptop. And even though I was initially thrilled to be in a virtual workspace, I found myself feeling more distant from the real world. I wanted to go outside more, and didn’t feel like looking at any screen at all by day’s end. I also noticed the difference in eye strain from screens so close to my face. I prefer to work near a window where I can shift my gaze into the distance. That rhythm of looking away and refocusing helps me process thoughts—especially after encountering something new. The Trouble With Losing Touch I asked my colleague Dr. David Sisson, a neurophysiologist, why XR adoption hasn’t matched media hype. He reminded me that audio and visual inputs—the primary senses XR taps into—aren’t the full picture. Then there’s the matter of touch in XR. “Without touch, there’s no ‘intimacy.’ You’re not really interacting with what’s going on,” David told me. “You can hit a ball—and hear the ‘crack’ in VR—but you’re not feeling anything other than a little jerk in the controller that makes you feel like there’s some inertia happening.” In short, headsets deprive us of the tactile and physical context that supports memory formation. Contrast that with playing a console game: you’re anchored in a physical space, hands on colorful controllers, with the screen at a distance. If you’re like me, you vividly remember not just the game, but the exact couch you sat on and the friends or family who played with you. The Neuroscience of Virtual Experience This sense of “placeness” goes beyond just touch. As David explained, “[C]hemical senses are not a part of [the VR experience] . . . There’s a well-considered idea, a linkage between olfaction, smell between memory—that you’re living that out of the [VR] picture entirely.” Attempts at incorporating virtual smells into XR exist, but it’s unclear whether they’re effective—or even desirable. Recent research supports what French literature has long told us: smell powerfully evokes memory. Studies show scent not only enhances recall but may also support learning across other sensory areas. While XR devices like VisionPro do re-create home and office setups and allow for vast screen real estate, they lack a true sense of location. Evolution shaped our brains to operate differently depending on whether we’re traveling or at home. Researchers call this the encoding specificity principle—our memories link closely with the environment where they were first formed. With a headset on, our minds don’t fully orient to a place, and so we never quite settle in. Apple offers a vast virtual workspace you can take on the go, but that benefit comes at the cost of the sensory richness and physical grounding of a real-world setup. Neuroscience, not just practicality, suggests that working in a physical space—with monitors, windows, textures, smells, and distance—offers deeper engagement and memory retention. Putting the “Pro” in VisionPro To be clear, XR headsets excel in specific contexts like rehabilitation or short bursts of fully embodied interaction, where body motion tracking is vital. Some content creators might find immense value in a distraction-free, multiscreen virtual studio. But that’s not a mass-market audience. XR evangelists may continue promoting VisionPro as the breakout device, but we—and Apple, for that matter—should remember that “Pro” isn’t just branding. It reflects the narrow set of advanced use cases that justify immersion. For most of us, computing still works best in a physical world that engages all five senses. And that’s not something XR can replicate—at least, not yet.",

        "description": "New figures released by Apple show that its App Store helped move more than $1.3 trillion worth of goods and services last year—though the tech giant only took a cut from a small slice of that. Most of the money, Apple says, came from business outside its commission model. Nearly 90% of those sales took place without the company pocketing a fee, as they involved physical products or services delivered offline, like food orders, retail shopping, or travel bookings. Digital services still made up a hefty share—roughly $131 billion—with mobile games, image editing tools, and work-related apps making up the bulk of that amount. In-app advertising added another $150 billion to the pot, showing that the App Store isn’t just about downloads but also runs as a moneymaking platform for marketers. Looking back to 2019, the spending has more than doubled across all categories. The biggest jump was in real-world goods and services, which ballooned to more than two and a half times their previous value. This rise mirrors changing consumer habits, as more people rely on apps to get things done—from ordering dinner to hiring a cleaner. Apple framed the report as proof that the App Store supports a wide range of businesses, not just those selling virtual content. It pointed to the platform’s reach and its role in helping developers get discovered. The company also highlighted the tech tools it offers—such as development kits, payment systems, and fraud protection. But critics argue that the App Store’s success is closely tied to Apple’s own devices. Since apps are one of the iPhone’s biggest selling points, some developers say they should be allowed to reach users on their own terms. Right now, Apple’s rules make that tricky. That grip is beginning to loosen. In the United States, a recent court decision sided with app maker Epic Games, requiring Apple to let developers direct users to pay on their own websites. In Europe, regulators are pushing similar changes under the Digital Markets Act, a law that forces tech firms to open the door to alternative payment options. The figures come from research funded by Apple and carried out by two economists—one based at Boston University, the other with the consulting firm Analysis Group, which has worked closely with Apple in past legal battles. The study also pointed to strong growth in places like the US, China, and Europe, where App Store sales have more than doubled over the last five years. In America alone, digital payment use has risen more than sevenfold—another sign of how mobile habits are shifting. Apple also shared that the App Store now pulls in over 800 million visits every week, underscoring its role as one of the biggest marketplaces on the internet.Read next: Meta’s Oversight Board Slams Slow Moderation of Deepfake Celebrity Ads on Platform",

        "description": "The vast majority of iPhone and iPad users are already running the latest versions of Apple’s mobile software, according to newly shared figures. The numbers show most users haven’t waited around to upgrade, with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 making quick strides in just a few months. Among iPhones launched in the past four years, nearly nine in ten now run iOS 18. When looking at all iPhones still in use — regardless of age — around eight in ten have made the leap. Things look nearly as healthy on the iPad front. Around 81% of newer iPads now use iPadOS 18, while 71% of all iPads have installed it. These figures suggest users haven’t dragged their feet when it comes to staying current. Looking back, iOS 17 and iOS 16 had strong showings too, but iOS 18 is holding its own. For instance, this time last year, iOS 17 was on 86% of newer iPhones. iOS 16, the year before, hit 90% — a high-water mark Apple hasn’t quite matched this round. iPads have followed a similar pattern. iPadOS 17 had reached 86% on recent models last year, a notch higher than iPadOS 18’s current mark. But in terms of all iPads in circulation, both iPadOS 18 and iPadOS 16 stand level at 71%. Several reasons help explain this fast uptake. First, iOS 18 works on older devices like the iPhone Xs, giving long-time users a chance to upgrade without splashing out on new kit. Second, software updates can be triggered straight from the settings menu — no need for tech know-how or cables. And third, Apple doesn’t rely on phone networks or third parties to push updates. It handles the lot in-house, speeding things up. From a security point of view, staying up to date matters more than ever. Each new update patches bugs and tightens defences against the latest threats. There’s also the added bonus of new features landing with every major release. Even so, not everyone wants to rush ahead. For those who prefer to tread carefully, Apple’s been offering a middle ground. When iOS 18 rolled out, users were also given the option to move to iOS 17.7 instead — a more familiar option that still delivers stability and fixes, without jumping headfirst into something new. All told, these adoption rates show that Apple still holds the reins when it comes to rolling out software at scale. Whether for features, security, or just peace of mind, most iPhone and iPad users don’t seem to need much convincing to stay up to date.While Apple’s software rollout stays tight and streamlined, the Android landscape, on the other hand, tells a more tangled tale.As of May 2025, Android 14 holds the largest share, running on just under 30% of phones and tablets. But the rest of the platform is scattered across multiple versions, including Android 13 (17%), Android 12 (12%), and even Android 10, which still clings to life on more than 5% of devices.This uneven spread isn’t new. Android’s open structure means phone makers like Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, and others all run their own shows. Each brand customises Android, adds its own features, and controls when — or whether — users get updates.That process often slows things down. Some devices wait months for new software. Others never receive it at all.For users, it means getting the latest version isn’t always in their hands. Factors like carrier approval, regional policies, and manufacturer priorities all come into play. While some premium Android models are now getting better long-term support, the broader market — especially at lower price points — still sees patchy and inconsistent update paths.So, although Android 14 leads the version chart, the platform as a whole remains fragmented, with millions of users still running older builds — and missing out on the latest security protections, features, and performance boosts that newer versions bring.Read next:• Are Creators the New Brands?

Apple must tear down its proverbial walled garden and allow for more competition and payment methods on its App Store.

Meta is stepping up its spatial computing ambitions, even as interest in Apple’s Vision Pro continues to be lackluster. [contact-form-7] Meta is testing artificial intelligence-generated 3D photos on Instagram within the Meta Quest augmented reality/virtual reality headset, according to a May 22 company blog post. It’s a step in the company’s long-term effort to make immersive computing mainstream. “Reality Labs is teaming up with Instagram to make the moments you share a little more magical,” the post said. The feature uses “AI view synthesis algorithms” to transform ordinary 2D photos “pixel by pixel — no fancy 3D cameras required.” Standard Instagram images can now be viewed with more depth inside a Quest headset. “That means flat photos that weren’t originally captured in 3D will automatically be converted into an immersive format that gives 2D images a sense of depth when you view them on Quest,” the post said. The update points to Meta’s broader vision of bringing everyday social media experiences into virtual environments powered by the company’s Horizon operating system. Lindsey Gamble, a marketing consultant, said in his own blog post May 23 that this is part of Meta’s early steps toward bringing more social and entertainment experiences into a spatial, 3D environment on Quest. “Converting 2D photos into 3D makes Instagram content more immersive and better suited to the spatial capabilities of Meta’s headset, all without creators needing to shoot their content in 3D,” Gamble wrote in the post. “This more engaging format could encourage consumption of Instagram on their headsets.” The move comes as Apple’s Vision Pro — heralded at launch as a revolution in spatial computing — has reportedly faced slower-than-expected demand. News reports have indicated that Apple has scaled back production forecasts for the mixed-reality headset. Meta Targets Existing Base In contrast, Meta is targeting its existing user base and using AI to reimagine everyday content in spatial form, rather than betting on high-end use cases. The Instagram 3D photo test is part of a wider software update to Quest’s operating system, Horizon OS, which also includes the rollout of a new virtual desktop called Navigator, per the company’s blog post. Navigator is “a new home for your games and apps, friends, notifications, essential system settings, and more on Quest,” according to the post. The interface is designed to function like a PC, allowing users to multitask and pin up to 10 items for quick access. “We designed Navigator based on everything we’ve learned over the last decade,” the post said. “And this is just the beginning of a broader evolution of Horizon OS.” The updates come as Meta continues to position itself at the intersection of social media and spatial computing. However, the company’s metaverse ambitions continue to bleed red ink. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which oversees Quest and smart glasses, had an operating loss of $17.7 billion in 2024. Meta is not letting up. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge that advances in AI and mixed reality will make headsets more useful in everyday life. Plus, the company’s Llama 4 large multimodal model is part of a broader strategy to unify its social, AI and immersive computing efforts. “We’ve got much more planned for the future of spatial computing, so stay tuned,” the company blog post said.

When Apple Pay launched in 2014, it promised a future free of plastic. Over a decade later, the ripples of that revolution are still unfolding across the way consumers pay, but not in the way observers may have expected a decade ago. [contact-form-7] While digital wallets have become a staple of online and in-store payments, it’s virtual cards, once a fringe tool for tech-savvy shoppers, that are quietly emerging as the next frontier in consumer finance. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Digital Payments Evolution: Virtual Cards Poised to Take Off,” a collaboration with Elan, revealed that 42% of consumers in the United States used a virtual card in the last six months, primarily for online purchases and subscriptions. Plus, 65% said they’re likely to use one in the year ahead. This could signal a potential turning point not just in adoption, but in the public’s appetite for payment tools that offer control, security and flexibility beyond what digitized physical cards can provide. Digital wallets have already done much of the heavy lifting in familiarizing consumers with cardless payments. Today, over half of U.S. consumers store at least one card in a wallet like Apple Pay or Google Wallet. That familiarity is increasingly proving crucial to the rise of virtual cards, which don’t exist as plastic first. Instead, they’re issued and used entirely digitally, often with one-time numbers for each transaction, limiting exposure to fraud. The Post-Wallet Phase of Digital Payments Among the most tech-savvy consumers, meaning those who own devices ranging from smartwatches to electric vehicles, nearly 3 in 4 have used virtual cards for online shopping. More than half have used single-use numbers. For this cohort, control and real-time functionality matter more than physical tangibility. For banks, card issuers and FinTechs, the next wave of digital payment innovation may not be about porting physical cards into phones, but instead around offering dynamic digital products that better reflect how consumers want to pay and protect themselves online. Virtual cards also unlock more sophisticated features. Real-time spending controls, immediate issuance post-approval, and seamless integration with merchant apps position them as more than a defensive tool. They’re a vehicle for engagement and differentiation in a competitive credit market. This opportunity is bifurcated, however. Digital Finance Enthusiasts — those who use mobile banking and budgeting apps daily — are the primary adopters. Meanwhile, the Mainstream Tech segment, including many Generation X and older consumers, still view rewards and cash back as top drivers, echoing the value propositions of traditional credit cards. The challenge now lies in bridging these two audiences. For digital-first consumers, highlighting virtual cards’ security, tech integration and convenience is key. For others, linking these features to familiar benefits like cash back or fraud protection could be essential to driving adoption. The report found that 17% of Basic Tech users said better fraud detection would increase their usage, but a full quarter of them also admitted they had never heard of virtual cards. Financial institutions must go beyond offering the product — they must explain why it matters, how it works, and where it fits in the broader payment ecosystem. Digital wallets may have cracked the door open. Virtual cards are poised to walk through it and redefine the very concept of a cardholder along the way. At the end of the day, the spotlight could now belong to the cards users can’t touch. The post Banks Bet on Virtual Cards as the New Credit Battleground appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Governments around the world made more attempts than ever in 2024 to access data from iPhone push notifications. Despite the surge, Apple turned down a greater share of those requests compared with previous years. In its latest transparency report, the company revealed that official requests linked to push notifications rose from 119 in early 2023 to 277 by the middle of 2024. But while the number of inquiries went up, the approval rate went the other way—dropping from 76 percent to just 59 percent. It’s the clearest sign yet that Apple is now more reluctant to hand over this type of user information, even as authorities increasingly rely on it. When someone enables notifications for an app, Apple generates a small data link known as a push token. It connects the user’s Apple ID, their device, and the app itself. This token allows the app to send alerts, but it also opens a door to identifying details like names, email addresses, and home locations—data governments can request. Apple said some countries did receive access to metadata and, in limited cases, unencrypted content delivered through its Push Notification service. That last part is key: if an app doesn’t encrypt the alerts it sends, law enforcement may be able to read the actual content of the message, not just the technical metadata surrounding it. The existence of this backchannel came to light in 2023, when a U.S. senator disclosed that both Apple and Google had been legally compelled to hand over push notification data. Privacy experts warned at the time that even apps designed for secrecy—such as Signal—could unintentionally expose sensitive information if their alerts were not encrypted end to end. Apple explained that it doesn’t decrypt push notifications itself, but acts as the delivery system. Whether the message remains private depends on how each app is built. This subtle detail, buried in the company’s report, has significant implications for users who assume their messages are always protected. The data also reveals which countries are most active. Between July and December 2023, the United States submitted 99 separate requests covering more than 300 push tokens. Apple responded to 65. The United Kingdom was more successful, submitting 123 and receiving data in 111 cases. Other countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Singapore also filed requests, but many of them were declined. One of the most unusual came from Israel, which asked for data covering 694 push tokens in a single request. Apple turned it down. While the report doesn’t say what that request involved, the size suggests it may have been a sweeping search tied to national security or surveillance efforts. No further details were released. In the first half of 2024, the pattern shifted again. The U.S. received information in only 36 cases. While the UK still saw many of its requests approved, the overall global approval rate dropped sharply to 28 percent. The change appears to follow a quiet policy update inside Apple. As of December 2023, the company now requires a judge’s sign-off before any push data is released. Previously, a simple subpoena would often do. This stricter rule mirrors Apple’s broader privacy campaign, which in recent years has included features like App Tracking Transparency and Mail Privacy Protection. Even so, push notifications remain a blind spot. Most users are unaware that these alerts, which often seem harmless, can include sensitive personal information and are stored by Apple as part of its infrastructure. In its report, the company said its goal is to inform users and to insist on proper legal steps before data is handed over. For those concerned, there are ways to limit exposure. Turning off notifications for apps that don’t need them reduces the number of push tokens generated. To stop message content from appearing on the lock screen, users can adjust preview settings to show messages only when the phone is unlocked—or not at all. It’s a reminder that while Apple has added more tools to protect privacy, some parts of the system still leave users exposed in ways they may not expect.Read next: WhatsApp to Let Users Build Custom AI Assistants Without Coding",

        "description": "Wayne Ma, reporting last month at The Information (a paywalled website so obnoxious that they force $300/year subscribers to click through an article-blocking popover pitching them on upgrading to a $500/year subscription), and summarized here by MacRumors: However, the smaller size of the new thin model will require compromises to its capabilities. The device will contain only a single speaker instead of the two speakers that Apple’s other phones usually have, one rear camera lens instead of the three in Apple’s flagship phones, and reduced battery life. Internal testing shows that battery life for the thin model will fall short of that of previous iPhones. The percentage of users who can go a single day without recharging the thin phone will be between 60% and 70%. For other models, that metric is between 80% and 90%, one of the people said. To solve this, Apple is developing an optional accessory — a phone case meant for the thin model that also contains a battery pack, according to three people familiar with the matter. It sort of goes without saying that the super-thin iPhone will have less battery life. How could it be otherwise? If 60–70% of users can still get through the day on a charge while using it, that sounds like it’s the right time for Apple to try such a phone. People who currently run their phones down to the red each day aren’t going to think “Hey, maybe I should try this crazy thin iPhone.” What disappoints me is Ma’s reporting of an iPhone Air-only battery case from Apple. What I very much want Apple to make is a sequel to its amazing MagSafe Battery Pack with a Lightning connector that debuted in 2020 but was discontinued in 2023 (the year that the iPhones 15 switched from Lightning to USB-C). I’ve got two of these and they’re still, by far, my favorite iPhone battery packs. They’re the only Lightning devices left in my life and they’re so good I’m happy to still keep one Lightning cable in my travel bag to use them. There are a zillion third-party “magnetic” (but not “MagSafe”) battery packs that work with iPhones, and most of them have larger batteries than Apple’s. But part of what makes Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack great is that it’s so small, and shaped so comfortably. I don’t need a magnetic battery pack that tries to double my iPhone’s battery life. I just need like 1.5× on occasional phone-heavy days (like next Monday’s WWDC keynote), and Apple’s does just that. No third-party magnetic battery pack I’ve tried comes even close to attaching as securely to the back of the iPhone as Apple’s. And Apple’s has special integration with iOS, which gives you a cool animation on the screen when it’s first attached, and updates the battery life of the pack in the Battery widget alongside the iPhone’s own battery. (Apparently some newer third-party packs do now show the full-screen animation when first attached, but none yet integrate with the Battery widget — someone better call the European Commission.) Most importantly, with Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, iOS is smart, and doesn’t keep sucking juice when the phone has recharged up to 70% or so. By only slurping juice when it’s more efficient to do so, you get more effective battery life out of a noticeably slimmer battery back. It’s just so much better than any other battery pack I’ve tried. This supposed iPhone “Air” seems like the perfect time to bring back the MagSafe Battery Pack, this time with USB-C — and unlike a model-specific case, it’d work with all MagSafe iPhones, not just the Air.

        "description": "Mac fan paid $900 to color-match iconic Apple beige-gray \"Platinum\" plastic for everyone. On Tuesday, classic computer collector Joe Strosnider announced the availability of a new 3D-printer filament that replicates the iconic \"Platinum\" color scheme used in classic Macintosh computers from the late 1980s through the 1990s. The PLA filament (PLA is short for polylactic acid) allows hobbyists to 3D-print nostalgic novelties, replacement parts, and accessories that match the original color of vintage Apple computers. Hobbyists commonly feed this type of filament into commercial desktop 3D printers, which heat the plastic and extrude it in a computer-controlled way to fabricate new plastic parts. The Platinum color, which Apple used in its desktop and portable computer lines starting with the Apple IIgs in 1986, has become synonymous with a distinctive era of classic Macintosh aesthetic. Over time, original Macintosh plastics have become brittle and discolored with age, so matching the \"original\" color can be a somewhat challenging and subjective experience.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The massive profits posted by major tech firms often attract attention, but breaking those numbers down per employee reveals something even more striking. Among the industry’s largest players, Apple leads in workforce efficiency, by a wide margin. Recent analysis from Statista shows that Apple generated $2.38 million per employee in 2024, significantly ahead of other tech giants. That figure places it well above Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, reflecting a consistent edge in operational output per team member. While Microsoft and Alphabet maintain strong positions in profitability and growth, Apple has built a reputation around maximizing returns through tight operational focus. Its revenue-per-employee figure exceeds Nvidia’s by roughly 15%, beats Alphabet’s by 25%, and more than doubles Microsoft’s efficiency rate. In the same measure, Microsoft came in at $1.08 million per employee, while Alphabet reached $1.91 million, highlighting the considerable gap Apple has carved out. Meta and Nvidia were the only other tech companies to cross the $2 million threshold. Meta registered $2.19 million per worker, placing second, while Nvidia followed with $2.06 million. The comparison gets even more dramatic outside the traditional tech space. Tesla’s revenue per employee landed at $780,000. Amazon’s number was even lower, around $410,000 — barely one-sixth of Apple’s. This gulf underscores more than just financial strength. It points to Apple’s ability to scale product lines, command pricing power, and optimize talent better than any peer in the sector. The company’s lean business model and emphasis on premium hardware have enabled it to extract greater revenue from fewer hands. Despite a slight dip in year-over-year profits — Apple’s net income fell 3% to $93.7 billion — it still ranked just below Alphabet, which ended the year with $94.2 billion in net income. Yet, in terms of pure productivity per person, Apple stayed in a league of its own. To illustrate that point, consider how quickly the company earns its profits. At its current pace, Apple generates about $178,200 per minute. That equates to $2,971 every second. Based on these figures, Apple earns as much in 17 seconds as the average U.S. worker does in a full year—around $50,000. Efficiency at that scale isn’t simply about headcount or automation—it’s a result of precise business execution. In a tech landscape dominated by expansion and acquisitions, Apple’s model of focused innovation, high-margin products, and strategic hiring continues to deliver unmatched output per employee.

A U.S. House bill takes aim at Apple and Google’s control over the mobile app ecosystem, seeking to curb practices lawmakers say restrict competition and inflate prices for consumers and developers. [contact-form-7] Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., introduced the App Store Freedom Act, a bill that would bar dominant app store operators from engaging in a range of business practices critics say are anticompetitive. “We have two predominantly large marketplaces through both Google and Apple, and at this point in time, you have a lot of apps that for many different reasons are finding trouble being hosted,” Cammack told Fox News. “There’s a lot of anticompetitive practices that have really dominated this space for years. This bill seeks to rectify those wrongs.” What the Bill Proposes The bill applies to companies controlling both an app store and its underlying operating system with more than 100 million U.S. users. The bill would require Apple and Google to allow users to set third-party apps or app stores as default, sideload apps without using the official store, and remove or hide preinstalled apps. It also mandates that developers get equal access to critical system tools and interfaces without cost and on equivalent terms as the tech platforms’ own apps. At the same time, the bill prohibits app store operators from forcing developers to use their in-app payment systems or requiring pricing parity across platforms. Companies would also be barred from retaliating against developers who distribute their apps through alternative means. The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit advocacy group formed by developers including Epic Games, Spotify and Match Group, endorsed the legislation. “This is a vital step towards empowering developers and consumers by ensuring a level playing field for all participants in the app ecosystem,” said Gene Burrus, global policy counsel for the coalition, in a statement. Increased Scrutiny The bill’s introduction comes at a time of regulatory scrutiny for Apple. In April, the European Commission fined Apple for violations of the EU’s Digital Markets Act related to App Store restrictions. In the same month, a U.S. federal district court found Apple in contempt of a prior order requiring the company to allow developers to direct users to external websites for purchases. The ruling was for a lawsuit brought by Epic Games after Apple removed its account for letting players pay outside of Apple’s ecosystem. The App Store Freedom Act closely aligns with the Open App Markets Act, a bipartisan bill that aimed to impose similar restrictions on dominant app store platforms. But the bill failed to become law. The new bill would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, with violations treated as unfair or deceptive practices under existing consumer protection statutes. State attorneys general would be empowered to pursue legal action on behalf of consumers. “The App Store Freedom Act could be a game-changer for American consumers by giving them more choice and control over their devices than ever before,” said Dustee Jenkins, Spotify’s chief public affairs officer, in a statement.

Although Smith's annual salary was $31,201, he was awarded stock options worth just over $164 million after meeting a series of targets over several years.He told The Wall Street Journal that the stock award came from a scheme open to all Axon employees that lets them convert salary into stock options, whose value depends on the share price performance. \"It creates that startup kind of vibe,\" said Smith, who has been CEO of Axon since 1993.Axon stock is up more than a fifth over the past month after posting strong first-quarter results.

OpenAI reportedly plans to turn ChatGPT into a “super-assistant” that is personalized to each user and available to them via the chatbot’s website, the company’s native apps, phone, email and third-party resources like Apple’s Siri. The plan is described in an OpenAI internal document from late 2024 that came to light in the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google, 9to5Mac reported Monday (June 2). The super-assistant will be able to handle tedious daily tasks like answering questions and managing calendars, and more complicated ones like coding, according to the report. It will be, the document said, per the report: “One that knows you, understands what you care about, and helps with any task that a smart, trustworthy, emotionally intelligent person with a computer could do.” OpenAI has announced several updates over the last month that suggest the company aims to expand the capabilities of its artificial intelligence tools. Chief Operating Officer, Brad Lightcap said Thursday (May 29) that OpenAI wants to build an “ambient computer layer” that doesn’t require users to look at a screen. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event, Lightcap said the company aims to build AI that is “truly personal.” On May 21, while announcing OpenAI’s plan to acquire io, an AI device startup co-founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he believes there is a better way to access AI. “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer,” Altman said. On May 7, OpenAI made a strong play for the consumer market with the hiring of Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to become the AI company’s CEO of Applications, a new division responsible for turning its research and models into products that directly benefit users. The Applications unit will bring together “a group of existing business and operational teams responsible for how our research reaches and benefits the world,” Altman said. Julia Huang, founding partner at Vesey Ventures, told PYMNTS at the time: “OpenAI clearly wants to own the consumer platform. They have a great shot at doing it, and Fidji’s experience at Instacart in bringing together merchants and consumers would be really valuable.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

China announced plans Friday to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting from April 10, in retaliation following U.S. President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement. The new tariff is the same rate of 34% on Chinese exports that Trump ordered earlier. President Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariff if China doesn't walk back its measures.

        "description": "After releasing Photoshop for iPhone in February, the promised Android version is here. Adobe has spent years releasing mobile apps that aren't Photoshop, and now it's finally giving people what they want. Yes, real Photoshop. After releasing a mobile version of Photoshop on iPhone earlier this year, the promised Android release has finally arrived. You can download it right now in beta, and it's free to use for the duration of the beta period. The mobile app includes a reasonably broad selection of tools from the desktop version of Adobe's iconic image editor, including masks, clone stamp, layers, transformations, cropping, and an array of generative AI tools. The app looks rather barebones when you first start using it, but the toolbar surfaces features as you select areas and manipulate layers. Depending on how you count, this is Adobe's third attempt to do Photoshop on phones. So far, it appears to be the most comprehensive, though. It's much more capable than Photoshop Express or the ancient Photoshop Touch app, which Adobe unpublished almost a decade ago. If you're not familiar with the ins and outs of Photoshop, the new app comes with a robust collection of tutorials—just tap the light bulb icon to peruse them.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "The first iteration of Brand New World was a very specific look at how AI is changing how brands and marketers work. Now we’re back to talk about brand culture more broadly. Of course that will involve AI from time to time, but I’ll also be digging into sports, entertainment, music, comedy, and everywhere else brands squeeze their way into pop culture. Everyone says they hate advertising, but everyone loves at least one brand. Brand New World is here to talk about why. That means I’ll be popping up in your feed once every month as part of the Fast Company Podcast Network. Okay, here’s what you’ll hear on the first episode of season two. Apple’s big (creative) year For those who don’t know or are unfamiliar, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is part awards show, part industry conference, and probably the biggest annual gathering of brands, marketers, entertainment folks, tech folks, and media on the planet. Anything and anyone that touches a brand—from social platforms to sports stars and celebrities—is there. This year, ahead of the festival that kicks off June 16, Apple has been named the Creative Marketer of the Year. Now, Apple is an iconic marketer, an all-time, first ballot Hall of Famer. But in my opinion, 2024 has been a bit of a mixed bag. So why is this Apple’s year? To discuss where this past year fits in the pantheon of Apple’s greatest hits, I called up Elizabeth Paul. A strategist by trade, Paul is the chief brand officer at award-winning ad shop the Martin Agency. You’ll know their work for major brands like Geico, UPS, the new Axe work with Pete Davidson, and much more. More importantly, she’s always up for some hot take banter about the work and culture around advertising and brands. Paul told me when she was rewatching a lot of Apple’s 2024 work, she kept thinking about whether any of it would fit into her top 5 list of Apple’s all-time work. “Is there anything this year that would dislodge something else that I’ve loved for a long time?” she says. “I would say the thing that got closest to me was ‘Someday,’ which is beautifully done and really powerful.” Listen to the podcast to hear us break down our top 5 lists of all-time Apple ads. Driving brand entertainment Last month, a new doc called The Seat debuted on Netflix about how Mercedes’ Formula One team decided on a successor for racing legend Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton had announced his departure, so the racing giant was forced to strategize its next move quickly and discreetly. That’s where WhatsApp comes in. The entire process of evaluating and naming young Italian driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli played out over the messaging app. The Seat is not only a feature documentary, but an excellent piece of brand entertainment, produced in partnership with WhatsApp. This episode I was excited to chat with Meta’s head of global consumer marketing Eshan Ponnadurai to talk about the process behind the doc, as well as the role it plays in the brand’s overall strategy. Esh has worked on major brands from Ford and P&G, to Uber, YouTube and Google. He’s got a long history of finding compelling and authentic brand stories to tell in unique ways. Here, we find out what The Seat takes from past successful work, particularly WhatsApp’s award-winning doc work We Are Ayenda, and its Giannis Antetokounmpo film Ugo: A Homecoming Story, as well as the precedent it sets for the future. “The primary thing was knowing what people are going to be interested in,” says Ponnadurai. “‘How did you get to this driver? Why him? What’s his story?’ That’s the hook. That’s what people are tuning in for. And then organically, how does WhatsApp play a role here? So I think the balance is always (between) what is the right story and what people are interested in, and where the product naturally fits. The danger sometimes can be the inverse: ‘We wanna sell you something, where’s the story?’”",

An […] The post Apple Appeals European Commission Order on Interoperability With Competitors’ Products appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple reportedly filed an appeal against an order from the European Union’s antitrust regulator that requires the company to make its iOS operating system more compatible with other companies’ products. The company filed its appeal Friday (May 30) at the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (June 2). An Apple spokesperson told the WSJ that the EU’s interoperability requirements threaten the user experience delivered by the seamless way the company’s technology works together; forces the company to share sensitive information with competitors; and poses security risks to its European customers. “Companies have already requested our users’ most sensitive data — from the content of their notifications, to a full history of every stored Wi-Fi network on their device — giving them the ability to access personal information that even Apple doesn’t see,” the spokesperson said, per the report. “We are appealing these decisions on their behalf, and in order to preserve the high-quality experience our European customers expect.” The EU’s competition regulator, the European Commission, said that to comply with its interoperability obligation under the Digital Markets Act, Apple must grant device manufacturers and app developers more access to iPhone features that interact with smartwatches, headphones or TVs and must provide developers with greater access to technical documentation and other resources that will help them obtain interoperability with features of the company’s iPhone and iPad, according to a March 18 press release. The commission had designated Apple as a “gatekeeper” of the iOS and iPadOS operating systems in September 2023 and April 2024, respectively; opened proceedings on Apple’s compliance with the interoperability obligation in September 2024; and communicated its preliminary findings to Apple and invited third parties to provide feedback in December 2024, according to the release. Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, said in the release that the commission’s decisions provided regulatory certainty to Apple and to developers and that it will ensure a “level playing field.” “Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple’s ecosystem,” Ribera said. “This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices.” The post Apple Appeals European Commission Order on Interoperability With Competitors’ Products appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "As President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and the global trade war began to dominate headlines, early attention focused on the impact on consumers, investors, and major companies like Apple and Ford. Since then, the spotlight has also turned to Main Street, where small and midsize businesses—including manufacturers and industrial suppliers—are increasingly feeling the strain. Analyses from the Institute for Supply Management and other industry sources confirm that costly fractures are now spreading across America’s supply chains, threatening the nation’s manufacturing revival. Small and midsize businesses—responsible for half of U.S. industrial production and three-quarters of the jobs in supply chain industries—are bearing the brunt of rising costs and ongoing economic uncertainty. These firms are central to America’s industrial future, yet little has been done to help them adapt, let alone boom, as President Trump promised during his campaign.As an example, in March The Wall Street Journal featured Tormach, a small Wisconsin-based machine-tool manufacturer, in a story on tariffs. In 2024, the firm relocated production to Mexico after learning about then-President-elect Trump’s planned tariffs on Chinese goods, only later to be hit by tariffs targeting Mexico. “We can’t just move factories overnight,” said CEO Daniel Rogge, reflecting the reality for many smaller manufacturers: Sweeping policy changes impose added costs and uncertainty they are not equipped to absorb. Mounting pressure This dynamic is playing out across the country, even if its effects are mixed (some types of firms can benefit). As tariffs upend global supply chains, small manufacturers in the U.S. are under mounting pressure—now with fears of recession, business failure, and job losses—just as their contributions are becoming more critical. Significant tariff increases and renegotiated trade deals are part of the Trump administration’s announced strategy to expand a “production economy” in America. But without greater predictability and solutions to help our suppliers adapt, the new protectionism threatens to derail a manufacturing revival already underway—one driven by geopolitics and catalytic national investments. Since 2021, the federal government has earmarked trillions of dollars to upgrade U.S. infrastructure, revitalize domestic manufacturing, and strengthen supply chains. These public investments underpin a modern industrial policy projected, by J.P. Morgan Private Bank in 2023, to catalyze $1 trillion in private investment over the next decade and encourage global companies to reshore operations. Small and midsize businesses are at the heart of this reindustrialization, as demand surges for the critical goods and services they supply. A strategic tool As trade policy experts and economic analysts have noted in recent months, tariffs can be a strategic tool when used selectively alongside other industrial policies—sheltering local firms, or at least buying them time to become more competitive, by making imported products from foreign competitors more expensive. Former President Joe Biden’s targeted tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and solar technology, for instance, were designed to align with public investment and regulation in his administration’s clean energy agenda. However, blanket tariffs against established trading partners challenge U.S. businesses in established global supplier networks, a central feature of integrated trade and distributed production. Manufacturers relying on cross-border supply chains report rising input prices and declining orders, which compound as components enter and leave U.S.-based factories. Further, the Trump administration’s approach has fueled widespread confusion, driving record-high small business uncertainty and declining optimism and investment, according to surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business. High stakes For small and midsize manufacturers in the U.S., the stakes are existential. One important reason is that these firms continue to face structural barriers that stifle their performance. Research from the McKinsey Global Institute shows that small businesses in U.S. manufacturing are less productive than their larger peers and international counterparts, thanks to challenges in accessing financing, skilled labor, technologies, and new markets. Tariffs, without adaptive support, threaten to deepen this divide. Historically, the U.S. has responded to disruptive trade transitions with adjustment programs designed to support domestic firms and workers. In particular, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (TAAF) was created in 1962 to help companies adapt to rising imports and global competition. But this program and others like it have proven too limited in scope and largely out of step with modern economic demands. Moreover, the Trump administration’s move to cut, and then restore, funding for proven small manufacturer programs, such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, along with court-contested funding freezes on infrastructure and other federal investments, further complicates efforts to rebuild America’s industrial base. A Marshall Plan As the Trump administration advances a sweeping protectionist agenda and other nations and trading blocs respond, the United States needs a modern trade adjustment strategy that matches the scale of our reindustrialization and the realities of shifting geopolitics. Following the November election, we called for a Marshall Plan for Small Business—a strategic framework designed to build the base of small and midsized firms and talent needed to drive America’s new industrial economy. The plan has three mutually reinforcing pillars, each validated by working examples in diverse regions of the country: 1) equip small businesses with the tools, services, and advisory support to navigate shifting markets, adopt modern technologies, and scale operations; 2) launch a small-business-centered workforce development model capable of training and mobilizing skilled workers across high-demand occupations; and 3) expand access to flexible financing tailored to the unique needs of small businesses and especially suppliers, supporting investments in research and development, equipment, workforce, and strategic growth opportunities such as mergers and acquisitions. Since his first term, President Trump has promised a manufacturing revival. Delivering on that demands a forward-looking agenda that gives small and midsize manufacturers and their workers—the backbone of America’s productive capacity—the tools, talent, and capital they need to survive and grow. This was important unfinished business before the U.S. launched a trade war. Now it’s an imperative.",

        "description": "Google has quietly rolled out a new app that lets users run artificial intelligence models directly on their phones — no internet required.Called AI Edge Gallery, the app is now available for Android, with an iPhone version on the way. It connects users with a wide selection of Generative AI tools, including ones that can generate images, answer questions, and even help write or edit code.The big difference? These models run on the phone itself, not in the cloud.That means you don’t need Wi-Fi or mobile data to use them. Everything happens locally, powered by the device’s own processor — a feature that could appeal to those who care about privacy or often work without a reliable internet connection.Once inside the app, users can choose from various tasks like “AI Chat” or “Ask Image.” Each task links to a list of AI models suited for that job — for example, Google’s own Gemma 3n.There’s also a feature called Prompt Lab that lets people experiment with text-based actions, such as rewriting or summarizing content. It comes with templates and settings to help users tweak how the model responds.Google says performance will vary when using these models. Newer phones with faster chips will handle the models more smoothly, while larger models may take longer to complete tasks — especially on less powerful devices.The app is still in an early testing phase, and Google is inviting developers to try it out and share feedback. It’s available under the Apache 2.0 license, so anyone can use it freely — even for commercial projects.Read next: How AI and Authenticity Are Changing the Way People Search",

        "description": "In less than two weeks, on June 9, Apple will kick off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), in which it will showcase the next versions of the operating systems that power its myriad devices. The centerpiece of that event will be iOS 26, the soon-to-be renumbered operating system that powers the company’s flagship product, the iPhone. Yet, despite artificial intelligence being all the rage in the tech industry right now, reports say that with iOS 26 (formerly referred to as iOS 19—see below), Apple will promote something visual instead of artificial. While some new AI features may be baked into the newly renumbered OS, the key feature of iOS 26 will be its complete visual redesign. In other words, your iPhone’s software is about to look strikingly different. Here’s how. Welcome to the solarium—and iOS 26 Two big changes are coming to the next iOS. The first is a naming rebrand. Historically, iOS versions were numbered sequentially, starting with “iPhone OS 1” for the original iPhone in 2007. With the iPhone’s 2010 operating system—its fourth version—Apple shortened the name to “iOS 4.” However, Bloomberg reports that starting with the new iOS Apple will debut on June 9, the company will drop the sequential numbering of the operating system, and go with the year it will spill over into, just like carmakers do with vehicles. So, despite being the 19th version, the upcoming iOS will no longer be called “iOS 19” and will instead be called “iOS 26.” This change will be carried over to the numbering system on all of Apple’s other operating systems, too, and is reportedly being done to provide a more uniform numbering scheme for its various software products (currently numbered macOS 16, iPadOS 18, and visionOS 2, etc), and make it easier for consumers to identify if they are running the latest device software. However, the rebranded iOS naming scheme is a relatively minor change compared to what else Apple has in store for iOS 19—sorry, iOS 26. That change is a radical visual redesign of the operating system. Most of what is currently known about iOS 26’s visual overhaul comes from two sources: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and Jon Prosser, host of the Front Page Tech YouTube channel. Both have reported on iOS 26’s major redesign, and their reports largely align, suggesting that they are, at least in part, accurate. So what will iOS 26 look like? Its internal codename—something Apple assigns to every software product in development—gives us a big clue. That name is “solarium,” Bloomberg reported. If you’re wondering what a solarium is, know that you’ve probably stood in one if you’ve ever been to an interior garden. It’s a room fitted with glass walls and ceilings, designed to let as much sunlight as possible filter in. Apple presumably chose the “solarium” codename for iOS 26 because the entire operating system will have a glass-like appearance. By “glass-like,” think of an operating system with elements like menus and toolbars that are partially transparent—you can see through them, and the colors and shapes of content behind them will show through, just like light shows through a solarium’s glass walls. If this sounds vaguely familiar to you, it’s because Apple has actually used similar transparency in one of its operating systems before—visionOS, the software that powers the Apple Vision Pro. Indeed, reports suggest that iOS 19’s design is inspired by visionOS. But visionOS powers a spatial computing device—one that melds the physical world with the digital. That 3D interface relies heavily on digital drop shadows and other visual tricks to re-create the feeling of physical depth. However, an iPhone’s operating system runs on a 2D screen, so don’t expect iOS 26 to feature heavy digital dropshadows. If you want to see how Apple will handle transparent elements on a 2D device, you don’t have to wait until June 9. Instead, simply check out Apple’s new Invites app, which it launched in February. You can see a screenshot of it above. See how different the UI looks in the app from the UI of iOS 18 currently? Those glassy panes in the app give the best visual hint of what to expect system-wide in iOS 26. Another reported feature of the redesign is reflective buttons and other elements that shimmer when you move your phone. This shimmering isn’t caused by real light hitting your iPhone’s screen. Rather, the software can tell, thanks to your iPhone’s gyroscope, when the device is moving and tilting in your hand, and will thus generate a reflective light effect across buttons to give the translucent objects more depth and form. It will probably be very similar to how the home screen icons in tvOS, the operating system that powers the Apple TV, appear to shimmer when you gently swipe them with your thumb using the Siri Remote’s touchpad. iOS 26 is also expected to gain other major visual changes, including floating pill-shaped toolbars (replacing the fixed toolbars used at the bottom of iPhone apps now), thinner buttons, a glass-like keyboard, and potentially even rounder app icons. What’s behind the iOS 26 visual shakeup? Those who have reportedly seen builds of iOS 26 say the redesign that Apple is set to unveil in less than two weeks represents the most significant visual overhaul to the iPhone’s operating system since iOS 7 in 2013—a design that has largely persisted through and to the current iOS 18. Indeed, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has called the redesign transformative, stating that it is “one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company’s history” while noting that it “will fundamentally change” the look of iOS. But here’s one thing about change: most people hate it—or are at least apprehensive about it. And Apple has a lot of people to contend with. It has more than two billion active devices around the world, used by hundreds of millions of users, and the switch isn’t coming to just the iPhone’s operating system, but to the operating systems of all of Apple’s devices this fall, including the iPad’s iPadOS, the Mac’s macOS, the Apple Watch’s watchOS, the Apple TV’s tvOS, and the Vision Pro’s visionOS (all renumbered to “26,” too). But Apple reportedly feels it needs to deliver something this year with iOS and its other operating systems that is, quite literally, eye-catching. It needs something special to help reinvigorate device sales, particularly after the flagship feature of iOS 18, Apple Intelligence, has largely been met with indifference by the average consumer and disappointment by AI aficionados. In January, respected TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that there was no evidence to suggest that Apple Intelligence was driving hardware upgrade cycles among consumers. In Apple’s most recent financial report, from its second quarter, iPhone revenue rose about 2% from the same period a year earlier, to $46.8 billion, but that growth may have been driven by U.S. consumers snapping up the device before Trump’s tariffs make iPhones more costly, notes Sherwood. Putting a new digital coat of paint on iOS 26 and the company’s other new operating systems is an easy way to make its devices feel fresh again—and, if done right, it can go a long way to actually making the ever-increasingly complicated operating systems more straightforward to use and easier to navigate. By incorporating the same design language used in iOS 26 into its other products, the redesigned interface may make users feel more familiar with Apple’s other devices, which could help spur sales of Macs or Apple TVs to people who currently only own iPhones. The iOS 26 redesign may also help distract from the fact that Apple isn’t expected to make any significant announcements regarding its AI platform, Apple Intelligence, at WWDC. Despite the early reports about iOS 26’s visual changes, we won’t know anything for sure until Apple unveils a preview of the upcoming operating system at WWDC on June 9. Speaking of that event: Apple’s logo for WWDC25 may be teasing the iOS 26 redesign in plain sight. If you check out the animated logo here, you’ll notice that the ends of the transparent, glass-like rainbow seem to show colored light reflecting through its surface—just like you’d see at a solarium.",

Google and the Department of Justice are set to present their closing arguments Friday (May 30) in an antitrust case that could force the tech giant to sell its Chrome browser, stop paying Apple to be its default search engine and share data with competitors. The DOJ has argued that these remedies are necessary to improve competition in online search, while Google is expected to counter that the proposals go too far and that narrower remedies would allow greater competition, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Friday. A ruling in the case is expected to be issued in August, according to the report. The DOJ filed its antitrust lawsuit against Google in October 2020, alleging that the company monopolizes the search and ad markets and maintains those monopolies by taking part in anticompetitive activities. The department said at the time that 80% of search queries in the United States were conducted on search channels owned or controlled by the tech giant. Google countered that it had not committed any wrongdoing and that users were free to choose any browser or site. A federal judge ruled in August 2024 that Google violated antitrust laws with its monopoly over online search and related ads. When announcing the ruling, the judge highlighted that Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure its search engine remains the default on smartphones and browsers, thus maintaining its dominant market share. The ruling set the stage for a subsequent trial to explore potential remedies. In November 2024, the DOJ proposed breaking up Google to curb its dominance in the search engine market. Among the proposed remedies were a forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser, which the DOJ described as a “critical search access point” that gives Google an unfair advantage; a ban on Google’s lucrative deals that make its search engine the default on devices like Apple’s iPhone; and a requirement that Google license its search index data to competitors, making it easier for rival search engines to compete. On the following day, Google blasted the DOJ’s proposal to remedy the government’s antitrust claims, saying it was “radical,” “overbroad” and would “break” a range of popular Google products.

        "description": "Apple stock is down 20% year-to-date, badly underperforming the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Some top voices on Wall Street see a buying opportunity. Apple stocks dropped after President Donald Trump threatened 'at least' 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones.Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesApple is the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock year-to-date by a large margin.Shares of the iPhone maker are down 20% in 2025, amid headwinds related to global trade and AI.Here's what Wall Street analysts and investors say about where the stock may be headed next.It's been a rough year for Apple.Shares of the iPhone maker were down 20% year-to-date through Thursday's close, making it the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock in 2025. The only other stock in the mega-cap cohort that's down this year is Alphabet, which has lost about 9%.Analysts say the decline has been brought on by a whirlwind of factors outside the tech giant's control, like the trade war, but its plunge this year could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors.Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said investors are mainly fretting over the impact of tariffs. The vast majority of Apple's iPhones are assembled in China, which could leave the firm more exposed to the impact of price increases.President Donald Trump has also singled out Apple, calling for the company to make iPhones in the US or else pay a 25% tariff.While Trump's trade war hit legal stumbling blocks this week, the court battles add another layer of uncertainty to how the trade war could play out.Apple, Zino said, is uniquely exposed to trade headwinds.\"Hardware is kind of in the middle, or in the eye of the storm, when it comes to the policy uncertainty, the tariff uncertainty that's sitting out there,\" Zino said, referring to how most tech hardware is manufactured abroad.James Demmert, the chief investment officer at Main Street Research, also thinks Apple's decline in the stock market this year is due to the company's lack of \"game-changing\" products. It was also late in implementing AI in its phones, and AI hasn't yet stimulated a boom in demand for iPhone upgrades.\"In terms of a new creative, blockbuster device or applications, the future is still uncertain,\" Demmert told BI.But, overall, many are still optimistic about the tech titan's prospects and its ability to navigate the trade war. Here's what analysts and investors say about what's ahead for the stock — and whether it's time to buy the dip.Goldman Sachs: BuyApple stock looks attractive on the basis of historic price-to-earnings, Goldman Sachs said this month.The bank's analysts said big risks to the stock include weakening consumer demand, potential disruptions to Apple's supply chain, and the possibility that Apple will be under increased regulatory scrutiny in key markets.Still, Apple is on track to continue growing, the analysts said, pointing to the \"durability\" of its revenue and product ecosystem.Goldman has a \"buy\" rating for the stock and a 12-month price target of $253, implying 27% upside.UBS: NeutralApple might not be that affected if Trump follows through with a 25% tariff on iPhones, and the stock could rise slightly from current levels, UBS said.If Trump implements a 25% tariff on phones not made in the US, that would likely only impact around 2% of Apple's annual earnings per share, the bank estimated.The firm has a \"neutral\" rating on Apple stock and $210 price target, implying 5% upside from current levels.CFRA Research: BuyFor long-term investors, it's the right time to buy Apple stock, CFRA's Zino told BI. The long-term growth trend for the stock looks intact, he said, and uncertainty surrounding tariffs and regulatory issues in China are likely to smooth out in the coming months.\"We believe that yes, it is a buying opportunity,\" Zino said of the stock's decline, predicting that the company's pricing and brand power could make it better positioned to pass along the cost of tariffs to consumers.Main Street Research: BuyMain Street's Demmert also thinks the stock is a buy despite uncertainty about its product roadmap and what the company might do next to reignite excitement about the brand.\"We think all of the bad news is in the current price of shares,\" Demmert told BI. \"In terms of AI and the China trade war, we expect significant improvement in the back half of the year, making the shares attractive at these levels.\"Wedbush Securities: BuyWedbush analysts wrote this week that Apple is equipped to navigate the headwinds from tariffs. The firm said that Apple remains one of its top picks in the tech sector for 2025.They pointed to how CEO Tim Cook told investors that around 50% of iPhones being manufactured for sale in the US were now being assembled in India, in order to avoid tariffs imposed on goods imported from China.\"It feels like Apple has a very good grip around this very complex tariff issue with Cook being 10% politician and 90% CEO,\" they wrote.The firm reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and $270 price target on the stock, implying 35% upside from current levels.Melius Research: BuyThe research firm said it believed that Apple is \"misunderestimated\" by investors.While the near-term outlook for Apple looks \"quite choppy,\" the Company has an installed base of around 2.4 billion devices. Analysts wrote that Apple is also working on higher-priced variations of the iPhone and could have new initiatives related to its AI and services businesses underway.The firm issued a \"buy\" rating and $240 price target for the stock, implying 20% upside from current levels.Clockwise Capital: SellClockwise Capital's chief investment officer, James Cakmak, said the firm had completely exited its position in Apple stock because tariffs make it too risky to hold, he told CNBC last week.\"What this simply creates is a no-win situation for anybody. Apple loses, consumers lose. And there's no getting around it,\" Cakmak said, referring to President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs on the company. \"It's not something we think will derail the company in a material fashion. At the same time, as an investor, you have to look elsewhere other than Apple.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Branded is a weekly column devoted to the intersection of marketing, business, design, and culture. Donald Trump has added a fresh punching bag to his ever-widening rotation of opponents: Apple. The president has, as he’s put it, “a little problem” with CEO Tim Cook. For Cook, this actually looks like a big problem—with no easy fix. Trump has been intermittently critical of Apple before, but this has always seemed to be adroitly smoothed over by Cook, who for years was “one of Mr. Trump’s most beloved chief executives,” and “tech’s leading Trump whisperer,” per The New York Times. It presumably helped that he was among those who donated $1 million to Trump’s second inauguration. But the president’s recent complaints about the tech giant’s overseas production have not only been harsher in tone than in the past, they have come with the ultimate marker of negative presidential scrutiny—a threatened tariff of 25% on iPhones. (Later Trump clarified that the tariff would also apply to smartphone from Samsung or any other brand made anywhere outside the U.S.) Apple doesn’t disclose iPhone sales by country, but worldwide they accounted for about 55% of its total revenue in the first quarter of its current fiscal year; iPhones make up about 53% of the U.S. smartphone market, according to research firm Backlinko. Revenue for its most recent quarter was around $95 billion (up 5% over last year), with earnings of about $25 billion. Remarkably, it had only been a matter of weeks since Cook was credited with scoring Apple an exemption on a then-planned 145% tariff on iPhones assembled in China for the U.S. market. Among other things, Apple announced it would invest $500 billion in AI servers in the U.S. Meanwhile various analysts began crunching numbers on what pure-U.S. production would do to iPhone prices, and soon the hypothetical $3,000 smartphone seemed like a new third rail of American politics. But as he has done with any number of prior third rails, Trump has now evidently shrugged off alleged risk. The immediate spark may have been at least partly personal: Cook reportedly declined an invitation to join the president’s recent swing through the Middle East. (Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Sam Altman of OpenAI were among the CEOs who did put in an appearance.) Trump not only publicly noted Cook’s absence, but openly mused about that “little problem.” Specifically, he said did not like reports that Apple and its suppliers are “building all over India,” apparently including iPhone factories, essentially to escape China-focused tariffs while keeping production overseas. “I don’t want you building in India,” Trump said he told Cook. Days later Trump reiterated on social media: “I expect [Apple iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.” Thus the squarely Apple-targeted tariff—and Cook’s dilemma. Up to now, he and Apple generally have tended not to return fire when the Trump administration pokes at the brand or its business practices, and has avoided tangling with the administration on hot-button issues where their priorities diverge (such as diversity). That anti-confrontational strategy might actually make Apple more attractive as a target for Trump: Pinning the make-it-in-America attack to the iPhone “generates maximum exposure” for the administration’s priorities, TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo argued recently. In short, Trump may figure the specter of a $3,000 iPhone is a bigger problem for Apple than for his policy priorities. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.) This also comes in what’s been a tough year or so for Apple generally: It lost an appeal related to its App Store pricing, saw its virtual reality headset draw a tepid response, and has been perceived to lag on AI integration. While the future of tariffs is still up in the air after a federal court ruled against them, Trump has lately become aware of the Wall Street slang TACO—Trump Always Chickens Out—indicating his threats tend to be empty, making it that much more likely that this time he’ll be stubborn. Simply capitulating does not appear to be an option for Apple: Actually moving iPhone production to the U.S. would take years and involve prohibitive costs, not to mention a sizable work force that America doesn’t currently have. And who can say whether some new device or alternative technology will supplant the iPhone while this huge undertaking plays out? One plausible strategy that’s been floated is for Apple to cook up a short-term “assembled in America” option that would involve some percentage of iPhones to be manufactured in a hybrid scenario involving some overseas production and final “assembly” at a U.S. facility. Similarly, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush called an American-made iPhone “fairy tale,” but speculated Apple could propose some token percentage of production moved to the U.S. over a period of years as a bargaining tactic. These tactics might still push the phones’ cost upward, but it wouldn’t triple it as a full-on shift to U.S. production might—and Trump could declare another victory in his campaign to de facto manage U.S. business. That said, speculating about Apple stumbling one way or another has been a popular pastime for years—years during which Apple’s market cap has climbed to above $3 trillion. While shares are down 17.5% this year, it remains the world’s third most valuable company. It’s wildly popular, as a brand, and as a stock. (“We don’t want to harm Apple,” Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, assured CNBC.) Of course Apple doesn’t want to be one of Trump’s many targets, let alone his favorite. But it can certainly take a punch.",

        "description": "For lovers of vintage Apple devices or anyone who grew up in the ’80s, a retro tech company just designed the ultimate throwback gadget: a working replica of the original 1984 Apple Macintosh that stands at just 62 millimeters tall. The device, called the “pico-mac-nano,” was created by retro tech enthusiast Nick Gillard for his website, 1-bit rainbow, which specializes in sourcing vintage Apple components. The mini computer is about half the size of a Coke can, comes in an ultra-detailed 3D-printed case, and has a single USB port that can be used for power and to connect a keyboard or mouse. Currently, it’s available online for backorder at just over $63, though Gillard has also compiled a detailed breakdown of all the components he used for any intrepid DIYers at home. In a blog post on the pico-mac-nano, Gillard explains that he was inspired by “the early days of computers, like the first Macintosh, when pioneers achieved remarkable things within the technological limitations of the day.” His version of the computer is a testament to just how much those technological limitations have evolved in the last 40 years. [Photo: 1-Bit Rainbow] Rebooting the first-ever Macintosh design Gillard, who is now 59, says his interest in vintage Apple products began when personal computers first started appearing during his school days. “My school had a Commodore PET, and I bought an Acorn Atom, so I’ve lived through this revolution and I’m pretty nostalgic about those early days of computing,” Gillard says. In 2006, Gillard started his own Apple parts company, The Bookyard Ltd., which sold modern Apple components for 15 years. After selling the company in 2021, Gillard started 1-bit rainbow this past November as an offshoot that focuses on Apple tech 25 years or older—a specialty that led him to conceptualizing the tiny 1984 Macintosh. [Photo: 1-Bit Rainbow] According to Gillard’s blog post, the idea to build a pico-mac-nano came from fellow retro tech enthusiast Matt Evans. In 2024, Evans created a system he called the Pico MicroMac, which could emulate the capabilities of the earliest Macintosh 128K (including applications like MacPaint, MacDraw, and MacWrite) on a modern desktop computer. Gillard followed Evans’ explanation of the revived Macintosh to build his own version at home. “Needless to say, I set about building a pico-mac and am not ashamed (slightly ashamed) to say I giggled like a little girl when that black & white, 512 x 342 pixel Macintosh desktop appeared on my VGA monitor and I launched Lode Runner,” Gillard wrote in a blog post. Still, he said, the experience had him thinking: “How much cooler would it be if pico-mac could drive a small LCD panel in a miniature replica Macintosh case?” The concept of building a scaled-down version of the design seemed possible, given that Evans’ Macintosh emulator was powered by Raspberry Pi’s RP2040 chip—a tiny microcontroller measuring just 7 by 7 millimeters. “As soon as I had it working and connected to a VGA monitor, it just screamed to be put in a little Macintosh case with an LCD,” Gillard says. [Photo: 1-Bit Rainbow] Designing the pico Mac nano, a 2″ computer To build his pico-mac-nano, Gillard started by searching for a mini LCD display screen that could load an approximation of the original Macintosh screen buffer, which featured a resolution of just 512 x 342 pixels (today’s 13-inch MacBook Air, by comparison, boasts a resolution of 2560 x 1664 pixels.) After some trial and error, Gillard ended up with a two-inch screen featuring a slightly less accurate resolution of 480 x 342 pixels, with the trade-off being that this option also allowed him to make the whole Macintosh even smaller. [Photo: 1-Bit Rainbow] With the LCD display as a touchpoint for scale, Gillard then used a 3D printer to make a 62 millimeter-tall plastic casing based on the structure of the original Macintosh, down to the ridges on top of the computer and the floppy disk slot on its front panel. On the inside of the rear case, Gillard added an embossed 1-bit rainbow logo where the original Macintosh team’s signatures would’ve been. The finished pico-mac-nano comes with a micro-SD card slot for memory storage and a single USB port, which, using a special splitter cable (also available at 1-bit rainbow), can both charge the device and make it compatible with a keyboard at the same time. Gillard has also designed a separate battery power module specifically for the device, “so you can whip it out of your pocket and wow your friends at parties.” The computer even comes packaged in a tiny version of the instantly recognizable “Picasso” box that the original Macintosh 128K shipped in. For those interested in purchasing the pico-mac-nano, Gillard warns in his blog that the device was designed as a proof-of-concept, not a finished product, and that it’s not necessarily guaranteed to run all early Macintosh software. Even so, chances are the pico-mac-nano is destined to become the ultimate collector’s item. In an era when iPods have become a popular example of “vintage tech,” the world’s tiniest workable Macintosh is a concept in a league of its own.",

        "description": "The digital marketplace Apple runs in the United States generated over $400 billion in developer-facilitated commerce last year, according to a new report backed by the company. Behind this figure lies a steady expansion in economic activity connected to apps, platforms, and mobile-based transactions—growth that has nearly tripled since 2019.Economic analysts from the Boston University Questrom School of Business and consulting firm Analysis Group traced the $406 billion to various sectors intertwined with App Store infrastructure. The majority of this total came not from digital products but from real-world goods and services. App-based retail purchases alone brought in $146 billion. Meanwhile, industries such as travel, food delivery, ride-hailing, and groceries contributed tens of billions more.Advertising delivered through in-app channels produced another $75 billion in revenue, while direct digital sales—like media, subscriptions, and app features—accounted for $53 billion.While Apple serves as the gatekeeper for these transactions, it collected no commission on over 90% of the revenue tied to this ecosystem in 2024. The company emphasized that small developers have shown particularly strong gains, seeing earnings rise by 76% over the last three years.Apple’s emphasis on economic empowerment and fraud prevention has increased as scrutiny around its App Store policies deepens. The company recently disclosed it prevented over $2 billion in suspicious transactions and blocked nearly 2 million apps from being listed in 2024. These enforcement efforts run parallel to growing criticism from regulators, especially regarding the platform’s restrictions on alternative payment paths and links that guide users outside Apple’s ecosystem.Even with ongoing controversy, the App Store continues to anchor a substantial portion of Apple’s broader influence in the tech economy. The infrastructure it supports plays a central role not only in revenue generation, but in shaping how modern services—from e-commerce to transportation—interact with consumers across the mobile landscape.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Google Brings Lens Integration to YouTube Shorts in Beta Rollout",

Apple’s App Store in the United States facilitated $406 billion in developer billings and sales last year. The findings are the results of a study by Professor Andrey Fradkin from Boston University Questrom School of Business and economist Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group, according to a Thursday (May 29) press release. “Importantly, for more than 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store, developers did not pay any commission to Apple,” the release said. “Over the last five years, the size of the App Store ecosystem has nearly tripled from $142 billion in 2019 to $406 billion last year, and earnings for U.S.-based developers also more than doubled. Small developers in particular have done exceptionally well as their earnings increased by 76% between 2021 and 2024.” The study estimated that the App Store ecosystem facilitated $277 billion in total billings and sales from physical goods and services last year, $75 billion from in-app advertising and $53 billion from digital goods and services, per the release. Among the main drivers were growth in food and grocery delivery, entertainment and enterprise apps. “And the App Store continues to be a global launchpad for innovation, with AI-powered apps increasingly shaping users’ daily lives,” the release said. Meanwhile, the study found that spending on travel and food delivery and pickup both surpassed ride-hailing, as users increasingly turned to apps to book travel, and restaurants increasingly offered delivery options through apps, according to the release. U.S. developers also saw increased earnings across top categories like productivity, education and business, with game developers garnering the highest earnings last year. The news came days after a report that Apple is planning to roll out tools that would allow third-party developers to write software using the large language models that power Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system. The company is due to announce the software development kit and other resources that will open the doors to this capability June 9 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Bloomberg News reported, citing unnamed sources. Also this week, Apple said the App Store prevented more than $2 billion in fraudulent transactions during 2024, and more than $9 billion in such transactions in the past five years.

        "description": "Instead of iOS 19, macOS 16, and watchOS 12, we'll get \"iOS/macOS/watchOS 26.\" There may never be an iOS 19 or a macOS 16, according to reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. At its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple reportedly plans to shift toward version numbers based on years rather than the current numbering system. This is intended to unify the company's current maze of version numbers; instead of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 11, and visionOS 3, we'll get iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS 26. The last time Apple changed its version numbering convention for any of its operating systems was back in 2020, when it shifted from \"macOS X\" to macOS 11. Note that the numbering will be based not on the year of the software's release but on the year after; this makes a certain amount of sense since iOS 26 would be Apple's most-current version of iOS for roughly nine months of 2026 and just three months of 2025. The update to the version numbering system will be accompanied by what Gurman describes as \"fresh user interfaces across the operating systems,\" a visual overhaul that will bring Apple's iPhone, Mac, watch, and TV software more in line with some of the design conventions introduced in Apple's visionOS software in 2024. Among the changes and additions will be another crack at \"Mac-like\" multitasking for the iPad.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "You couldn’t have missed the news: Jony Ive and Sam Altman have teamed up, after OpenAI acquired Ive’s company io for $6.5 billion. The plan? For Ive, and a sizable team of ex-employees from Apple, it’s to create a series of hardware products for OpenAI. The news alone dropped shares of Apple by 1.8% as two of the most celebrated software and hardware development teams in the modern era have combined to realize the potential of artificial intelligence and change the way we live. Hopefully for the better. The first io product, according to The Wall Street Journal, arrives in 2026. It will be a small object “capable of being fully aware of a user’s surroundings and life.” I imagine an environmental (audio, video, etc.) monitor the size of a macaron or iPod shuffle that Ive says accompanies a smartphone and laptop as a third device—which you can carry on your person or put onto the table. Despite the immensity of the partnership, it’s easy to be skeptical. After all, AI hardware has flopped thus far, due to a lack of vision and a lack of execution. And as wondrous as ChatGPT is, it still hallucinates and requires vast amounts of energy to train and operate. But within these barely explored large language models, there’s still hidden potential that designers have yet to tap. As Ive told me back in 2023, there have been only three significant modalities in the history of computing. After the original command line, we got the graphical user interface (the desktop, folders, and mouse of Xerox, Mac OS, and Windows), then voice (Alexa, Siri), and, finally, with the iPhone, multitouch (not just the ability to tap a screen, but to gesture and receive haptic feedback). When I brought up some other examples, Ive quickly nodded but dismissed them, acknowledging these as “tributaries” of experimentation. Then he said that to him the promise, and excitement, of building new AI hardware was that it might introduce a new breakthrough modality to interacting with a machine. A fourth modality. Ive’s fourth modality, as I gleaned, was about translating AI intuition into human sensation. And it’s the exact sort of technology we need to introduce ubiquitous computing, also called quiet computing and ambient computing. These are terms coined by the late UX researcher Mark Weiser, who in the 1990s began dreaming of a world that broke us free from our desktop computers to usher in devices that were one with our environment. Weiser did much of this work at Xerox PARC, the same R&D lab that developed the mouse and GUI technology that Steve Jobs would eventually adopt for the Macintosh. (I would also be remiss to ignore that ubiquitous computing is the foundation of the sci-fi film Her, one of Altman’s self-stated goalposts.) I’ve written about the premise and promise of ubiquitous computing at length, having been privileged enough to have spoken with several of Weiser’s peers. But one idea has stuck with me the most from Weiser’s theories. He often compared the vision of quiet computing to a forest. In a forest, you’re surrounded by information—plants, animals, and weather are all signaling you at once. And yet, despite your senses taking in all this data, you’re never overwhelmed. You never find yourself distracted, or unhappy. (Perhaps it’s disconcerting when the storm clouds roll in, but I’d still take the sound of low rolling thunder over a Microsoft Teams notification any day.) Ive never described what that fourth approach to interface looked like—he chooses his descriptors carefully and would not pigeonhole a burgeoning idea with limiting words. But for a man who planted 9,000 native trees when designing Apple Park and has expressed his own responsibility for the negative impacts of the smartphone, it’s hard to imagine he feels all that differently from Weiser. And that all comes to mind when analyzing the very little we know about the first io product. This first machine from io seems to be the input device needed for ubiquitous computing. I imagine the macaron will likely leverage notifications on your phone and audio in your ear to communicate with you. Down the line the partnership has teased “a family of products,” meaning, who knows what other UX possibilities io could dream up. [Images: Jason marz/Getty Images, Yevhen Borysov/iStock/Getty Images Plus] While we can barely say anything more specific, there does seem to be a fork in the road here philosophically. Whereas it appears that Google, Apple, Meta, and Snap are all betting on smart glasses to introduce the idea of ubiquitous computing—sensors and pixels that sit in your eyes all the time—at least for launch, io is doing the opposite. All of the leaked details so far point toward io developing the quietest, most discreet computing device we’ve ever had. I’m thinking of it as something like the silent conductor to the orchestra of the products we already own before, perhaps, one day doing more. Drafting off the smartphone The inconvenient truth for any innovator planning to disrupt consumer hardware is that there’s a lot more competition than there used to be when the Walkman, iPod, or Razr came around. There are 7.21 billion smartphones in the world today—nearly one per person, adding up to a $434 billion hardware industry in 2025, according to IDC. (Do note: Almost all of them, regardless of brand, are still designed along the lines of Ive and his team’s original vision.) These supercomputing screens aren’t simply ubiquitous; they are essential. From 4K video social media posts that go global in an instant, to turn-by-turn GPS directions navigating us through our lives, to the infrastructure of hailing an Uber or Lyft, to the mindlessness of checking out at stores, to the frictionless experience of riding public transit, to the necessary remote for controlling appliances, to, when all else fails, having the option to makes calls via satellites, we deeply depend on these screens in our pockets. There is no future in which the smartphone suddenly goes extinct, not because it’s perfect for society but because it’s so ingrained in the many disparate parts of our living infrastructure. A world suddenly without working smartphones would plunge us into some level of chaos. The first error of the Humane Ai Pin—the hyped AI gadget by Apple alum Imran Chaudhri, backed by Altman—was when it claimed it could replace your phone by, more or less, simply removing the screen and sticking it on your shirt. (The second error was when it just didn’t work.) The first io device seems to acknowledge the phone’s inertia. Instead of presenting itself as a smartphone-killer like the Ai Pin or as a fabled “second screen” like the Apple Watch, it’s been positioned as a third, er, um . . . thing next to your phone and laptop. Yeah, that’s confusing, and perhaps positions the io product as unessential. But it also appears to be a needed strategy: Rather than topple these screened devices, it will attempt to draft off them. [Images: iStock/Getty Images Plus, Yevhen Borysov/iStock/Getty Images Plus] On paper, that is such a vague idea that it’s either dull or exhilarating, depending on your disposition. Personally, it’s so darn hard to realize that I wouldn’t give it much attention if it weren’t for the team building it. Ive founded io with some of the greatest engineering and design talents out of Apple. He also founded his firm LoveFrom with much of his core design team from Apple. These two firms will be tag teaming with OpenAI, the most singular force in kicking off the current AI era. By comparison, as I write this, a Limitless pendant sits on my desk, fully charged, fully unused. It’s an AI system that will listen to your life to transcribe everything. Designed by Ammunition, the same lauded design firm behind Beats headphones, it’s slick, small, and carefully realized. It clamps right onto any fabric with a magnet. But after a week with it, I still don’t know when or where I should wear it. With my family? Feels weird. At work? I work remotely, so I have Zoom, Teams, Slack, and every other platform already recording me. (And at any job, there’s sensitive stuff you don’t want recorded.) So that’s out. What does that leave? Hanging with friends? The one time in my life as a journalist that’s thoroughly off the record, no thank you. How deep is too deep into your life? My concerns for this io device are many, though privacy is top of mind. I can imagine some interesting UX around opting in to being recorded, but will OpenAI go that direction or just brute force itself into our lives? I can’t help but remember that despite Apple’s privacy-first messaging, the iPhone went from a wondrous pocket computer to the ultimate personal advertising tracker—a decision made at the level of its chipset and supportive APIs. However, my concerns around privacy are perhaps more existential than my personal conversations being monetized. I wonder, if there’s always this AI around, will we be allowed to be private in our own thoughts anymore? Will we be afforded the privacy to draw our own conclusions? Before these artificial entities, our lives have largely been colored by the people around us. Our family, spouses, friends, and coworkers. A chance encounter with a stranger can make a day or spoil it. It’s so often someone’s take on events that shapes our own—like leaving a movie theater, I almost always agree with the take of my companion. Let’s assume we all acquiesce to this new wave of technology where an AI companion sits alongside us all the time. Suddenly, every experience we have is being processed by a third party. It’s something that will be analyzing and summarizing our actions and interactions. It will shape what we do next, a vast acceleration of how algorithms shape our experience across social media today. Even if this io product doesn’t live in our eyes, the extreme su",

        "description": "After a two-year absence from the top, Apple’s iPhone 16 has reclaimed its place as the world’s most-sold smartphone during the first quarter of 2025, according to Counterpoint Research’s latest handset tracker. Apple didn’t just lead the pack—it flooded it, placing five models among the global top 10 for the fifth March quarter in a row. Samsung, by comparison, fielded one fewer device than it did during the same period last year.The broader rankings held steady in terms of overall market share. But one notable shift was the rising contribution of ultra-budget devices—specifically those priced below $100—which gained ground within the top 10.Apple’s flagship base model found solid traction in regions like Japan and MEA (Middle East and Africa), with Japan standing out for its steep rise in iPhone 16 adoption. A mix of improved local economic sentiment and newly adjusted subsidy policies worked in Apple’s favor, reinforcing the brand’s positioning and value proposition in that market.Further down the rankings, Apple’s high-end offerings—namely the iPhone 16 Pro Max and 16 Pro—held the second and third spots. However, those models faced resistance in China, where local subsidies favored cheaper alternatives under 6,000 yuan (roughly $833), and where domestic players like Huawei continued gaining ground in the premium tier. Still, Apple’s Pro line held firm, accounting for nearly half of all iPhones sold globally for the third quarter straight.Apple’s newest wildcard, the iPhone 16e, made a strong first impression. It landed in sixth place globally after just one full month on shelves. Despite costing more than the 2022 iPhone SE, the 16e is expected to surpass that model’s early performance, helped by a more capable hardware package and broader appeal among budget-conscious upgraders.Over on the Android side, Samsung saw its Galaxy S25 Ultra settle into the seventh slot. That was a drop from the S24 Ultra’s fifth-place finish last year, though this wasn’t a sign of weak demand. Instead, the newer model had a shorter time on the market during Q1. Still, the S25 series made an impact, contributing a quarter of Samsung’s total smartphone sales for the month it was available. The Ultra also underscored Samsung’s deeper push into AI integration—especially with Gemini-powered features now embedded across the experience.Samsung also saw a boost in the midrange segment. The Galaxy A16 5G took fifth place, climbing one rung higher than the A15 5G had in 2024. Sales jumped 17% year-over-year, powered by wider distribution—particularly in North America, which alone made up a third of the model’s global sales. The phone also gained steam in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and MEA, all regions where 5G adoption at lower price points continues to accelerate.In the entry-level arena, Samsung’s Galaxy A06 quietly became a success story. It jumped four positions compared to its predecessor’s showing last year. Its gains were part of a broader lift in demand for low-cost phones, which saw sharp growth across all emerging regions. MEA, APAC, and LATAM drove roughly 75% of A06 sales. As prices for components fell, the sub-$100 category became the fastest-growing segment in the first quarter, capturing close to 20% of all smartphones sold worldwide.Meanwhile, Xiaomi held firm as the only brand outside the Apple–Samsung duopoly to place a device in the top 10. The Redmi 14C 4G outpaced its predecessor with a 43% year-over-year increase in sales, largely thanks to strong performance in price-sensitive markets like MEA and LATAM. Xiaomi’s formula of solid specs at aggressive pricing continues to resonate in those regions.Looking ahead, even with geopolitical uncertainties and trade headwinds, analysts expect the top-10 rankings to remain stable. As brands double down on premium devices, consumer demand is increasingly being driven by cutting-edge features and ecosystem advantages—not just price.Read next: • AI Tool 'YouTube-Tools' Scrapes Comments to Build User Profiles, Raising Privacy Alarms• Looking for the Best AI Logo Generators in 2025?

Apple reportedly plans to change how it names its operating systems, identifying them by a year rather than a version number. The new names will be based on the upcoming year, rather than the current year, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (May 28), citing unnamed sources. This naming system will begin with the companies’ next operating systems, so the updates will include iOS 26, iPad OS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26, according to the report. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, Apple is making the change to eliminate the confusion that comes from its current practice in which operating systems have different numbers because they debuted at different times and are now in different versions. The company’s current operating systems include iOS 18, watchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2, per the report. Apple will announce this change June 9 during its Worldwide Developers Conference, according to the report. It was reported in March that with its next operating systems, Apple plans to make the most significant upgrade to the Mac since 2020 and to the iPhone since 2013. The company plans to make the operating systems of its devices simpler to navigate and more consistent across its iPhone, iPad and Mac, Bloomberg reported March 10, citing unnamed sources. The report said Apple’s revamp of its operating systems will include the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons; simpler ways to navigate and control the devices; and innovations introduced on visionOS, the operating system for its mixed-reality headset. It was reported May 22 that Apple plans to introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced smart glasses that would compete with Meta’s Ray-Bans and aims to launch these new products at the end of 2026. The smart glasses are expected to be fitted with cameras, microphones, speakers and the Siri voice assistant. They will be able to handle phone calls, play music, provide live translations and deliver turn-by-turn directions, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. The smart glasses project is part of a broader effort by Apple to develop a “breakthrough AI product,” the report said.

        "description": "Meta has spent 15 years shunning the iPad. Now, it seems they’re finally ready to embrace the tablet lovers. WhatsApp users can finally text from the big screen. On Tuesday, Meta announced that the popular messaging app is finally available on iPadOS devices, including expanded features for multitasking. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Meta is finally building Instagram for the iPad as well. It’s a curious time to embrace tablets. While still a high-volume sales item, the iPad is losing its popularity. The device has endured a yearslong backslide in growth, comprising only 6.8% of Apple’s revenue in 2024 compared to the boom of more than 15% in the early 2010s. Still, an iPad expansion opens Meta apps up to a broader swath of consumers. Meta’s iPad expansion WhatsApp has been mobile-first since its 2009 launch. Meta purchased the app $19 billion in 2014, mostly leaving it alone to rake in revenue from its then 600 million active users. That number now sits closer to 3 billion, a rival to Facebook and beating out Instagram (Meta doesn’t split their revenue reports by app, but experts estimate that WhatsApp now generates nearly $20 billion annually). Recently, though, Meta has been taking a more active role in WhatsApp’s development. They added messaging functions like emoji reactions, built access via Mac and Windows computers, and broke down privacy barriers by tying WhatsApp to other Meta properties. Though there has been an an iPhone app since 2009, iPad users needed to access WhatsApp via their browser, where users were unable to make calls. Now, Meta has finally launched a standalone iPad app. The app is mostly the same as its iOS alternative, though it integrates common iPad tools like the Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. Since iPads allow split screens, users can now message and call while scrolling other apps, while mobile users still need to toggle between them. (Meta did not respond to a request for comment.) Instagram is Meta’s other major iPad holdout. To access Instagram on a tablet, users must expand the iPhone app, which can reduce image quality. In 2022, Instagram head Adam Mosseri tweeted that that the Instagram for iPad supporters were “still just not a big enough group of people to be a priority,” but that they would “get to it at some point.” Now seems to be the time: According to The Information, Meta is building an iPad version of Instagram to compete with TikTok amid the Chinese app’s regulatory challenges. Meta’s device strategy shift is more apparent in their smaller apps. In July 2023, it launched their X competitor, Threads, for mobile only. Two years later, the app still doesn’t have an iPad counterpart. Compare that to the new Meta AI app which launched last month. This app debuted for both iPhone and iPad, a rarity for Meta. Why is Meta interested in iPads now? When the iPad hit its peak in the mid-2010s, Meta still refused to tailor many of their social apps for the bigger screen. Now, growth is depressed, innovation has slowed, and iPad mania has cooled. Why is Meta now interested in an iPad play after all these years? The choice could be reflective of consumer sentiments. As social apps speed towards entertainment platforms (and away from social connectors), many users are looking for bigger screens. YouTube is now more popular on TVs than it is on phones. Meanwhile, the streaming services that are most popular on iPads are fashioning themselves after social apps. This convergence of content could make being on alternate screen sizes more important for the consumer. The move towards iPads could also be a legacy play. While tablet popularity is waning among the general population, it remains dominant among young children. The Generation Alpha sub-demographic of ages 7-9 are affectionately titled “iPad kids,” with almost 80% raised with easy access to an iPad. This young demographic is also already on social media, and even on the smaller platforms. Feeding their apps to “iPad kids” could ensure longevity, or help Meta reach an underserved consumer base. Meta apps are significantly less popular among Generation Alpha, after all, with the young users opting for YouTube, TikTok, and even Snapchat. Or, Meta could just be embracing a bigger group of consumers. Tablet lovers have waited 15 years, after all. Meta is finally embracing them.",

        "description": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday signed into law a bill requiring Apple and Alphabet’s Google to verify the age of users of their app stores, putting the second-most-populous U.S. state at the center of a debate over whether and how to regulate smartphone use by children and teenagers. The law, effective on January 1, requires parental consent to download apps or make in-app purchases for users aged below 18. Utah was the first U.S. state to pass a similar law earlier this year, and U.S. lawmakers have also introduced a federal bill. Another Texas bill, passed in the state’s House of Representatives and awaiting a Senate vote, would restrict social media apps to users over 18. Age limits and parental consent for social media apps are among the few areas of wide U.S. consensus, with a Pew Research poll in 2023 finding that 81% of Americans support requiring parental consent for children to create social media accounts and 71% support age verification before using social media. The effect of social media on children’s mental health has become a growing global concern, with dozens of U.S. states suing Meta Platforms and the U.S. Surgeon General issuing an advisory on safeguards for children. Australia last year banned social media for children under 16, with other countries such as Norway also considering new rules. How to implement age restrictions has caused a conflict between Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, and Apple and Google, which own the two dominant U.S. app stores. Meta, along with social media companies Snap and X, applauded the passage of the bill. “Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child’s age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it, and more than one-third of US states have introduced bills recognizing the central role app stores play,” the companies said. Kathleen Farley, vice president of litigation for the Chamber of Progress, a group backed by Apple and Alphabet, said the Texas law is likely to face legal challenges on First Amendment grounds. “A big path for challenge is that it burdens adult speech in attempting to regulate children’s speech,” Farley told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. “I would say there are arguments that this is a content-based regulation singling out digital communication.” Child online safety groups that backed the Texas bill have also long argued for app store age verification, saying it is the only way to give parents effective control over children’s use of technology. “The problem is that self-regulation in the digital marketplace has failed, where app stores have just prioritized the profit over safety and rights of children and families,” Casey Stefanski, executive director for the Digital Childhood Alliance, told Reuters. Apple and Google opposed the Texas bill, saying it imposes blanket requirements to share age data with all apps, even when those apps are uncontroversial. “If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it’s an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,” Apple said in a statement. Google and Apple each has its own proposal that involves sharing age range data only with apps that require it, rather than all apps. “We see a role for legislation here,” said Kareem Ghanem, senior director of government affairs and public policy at Google, told Reuters. “It’s just got to be done in the right way, and it’s got to hold the feet of Zuckerberg and the social media companies to the fire, because it’s the harm to kids and teens on those sites that’s really inspired people to take a closer look here and see how we can all do better.” —Stephen Nellis, Reuters",

        "description": "Apple’s efforts to protect its App Store from fraud scaled significantly in 2024, with new figures showing the company intercepted over $2 billion in attempted fraudulent transactions. That figure contributes to a five-year total exceeding $9 billion, revealing how digital threats have intensified as mobile commerce expands.The company’s internal systems flagged a surge in bad actors attempting to exploit both developers and customers. Nearly 4.7 million stolen credit cards were detected and blocked from use on the platform. Over 1.6 million accounts associated with suspicious financial activity were permanently banned.Account fraud remained a major concern. Apple terminated more than 146,000 developer accounts, up from 118,000 in the previous year. It also stopped 139,000 attempts by fraudulent developers to onboard onto the App Store. Many of these accounts, investigators found, tried to push deceptive or malicious software disguised as legitimate apps.While fraudulent developers posed threats, everyday user accounts also became vectors for abuse. Some were used to manipulate reviews, tamper with search results, or interfere with app visibility. Apple halted over 711 million fake customer account creation attempts and banned 129 million accounts judged to be harmful or non-genuine.The company removed more than 143 million fraudulent reviews out of over 1.2 billion processed, part of its ongoing push to maintain user trust and platform integrity. Thousands of deceptive apps were also removed from the App Store charts and search rankings for violating platform manipulation policies.App submission numbers revealed the scale of the challenge. From 7.7 million submissions in 2024, Apple rejected 1.9 million for failing to meet platform requirements. Investigations into individual fraudulent submissions often led to the uncovering of wider developer networks trying to circumvent the review process.Malicious actors continued to test boundaries with apps hiding unapproved or undocumented functionality. Apple removed about 43,000 such submissions last year. Meanwhile, another 17,000 apps faced removal for bait-and-switch tactics—appearing harmless during review but behaving differently after launch.Apple’s data suggests that despite the sophistication of today’s digital threats, active surveillance systems, both automated and human-led, continue to play a crucial role in keeping the App Store environment secure and trustworthy.Read next: Google Rejects Claims AI Search Is Draining the Web, Says Queries Are Rising",

Apple has extended Tap to Pay on iPhone to eight more European countries. The feature, which enables merchants to use an iPhone to accept in-person contactless payments, was launched Tuesday (May 27) in Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg and Malta, Apple said in a Tuesday press release. With an iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app, businesses can accept payments from contactless credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and other digital wallets, according to the release. Because no additional hardware or payment terminal is required, merchants using this solution can accept payments anywhere they do business, per the release. “Apple works closely with leading payment platforms and app developers across the payments and commerce industry to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone,” the release said. “Payment platforms and developers can integrate Tap to Pay on iPhone into their iOS apps, making it easy for merchants to enable this secure and convenient capability.” The company launched Tap to Pay on iPhone in nine other European countries in March, expanding the availability of the contactless payment method to Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland. When financial service provider Mollie announced in January that it expanded Tap to Pay to iPhone to merchants in three more European countries, Mollie CEO Koen Köppen said in a press release that the feature “[allows] local businesses to give their customers more choice and flexibility.” Adyen extended Tap to Pay on iPhone to additional European countries in October, with Alexa von Bismarck, president EMEA at Adyen, saying in a press release, “We have seen how Tap to Pay on iPhone has changed how consumers and businesses experience mobile payments for the better across the many regions where Tap to Pay on iPhone is already available with Adyen.” Mobile payment solutions untether merchants from a single checkout spot, PYMNTS reported in October. The technology extends across industries, from restaurants to delivery services, providing merchants with greater flexibility to meet their customers where they are — and it is especially useful for small businesses that may not have the resources to invest into and maintain high-tech hardware infrastructure.

Apple did not […] The post Report: Apple to Add Dedicated Video Game App to Devices appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple reportedly plans to add a dedicated app for video games to its devices in the next versions of its operating systems, which are set to be released in the fall. The company will preinstall the app on the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 27), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s new app will serve as a launcher for titles, centralize game-related activities, feature editorial content from Apple and promote its Arcade subscription offering, according to the report. It will replace Apple’s Game Center social network. Currently, two-thirds of the company’s App Store revenue comes from games and in-app purchases of game upgrades, the report said. It was reported in March that Apple is planning its most significant upgrade to the Mac operating system since 2020 and to the iPhone’s one since 2013. The company aims to make the operating systems of its devices simpler to navigate and more consistent across iPhone, iPad and Mac. Expected to be delivered later this year as part of iOS 19, iPadOS 19 and macOS 16, Apple’s revamp will include the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons; simpler ways to navigate and control the devices; and innovations introduced on visionOS, the operating system for its mixed-reality headset, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. It was reported Thursday (May 22) that Apple plans to introduce artificial intelligence-enhanced smart glasses that would compete with Meta’s Ray-Bans. The company aims to produce a large quantity of prototypes by the end of the year and then release the smart glasses at the end of 2026. On May 20, it was reported that Apple plans to introduce tools that will let third-party developers write software using the large language models that power Apple Intelligence, starting with the small AI models that run on its devices. By expanding its AI technology to developers, the company hopes to encourage the creation of new applications that will increase the use of Apple Intelligence and make its products the devices of choice for AI applications.

Through the effort, dubbed Project Eagle within Apple, the companies would lob thousands of Boeing satellites into orbit to beam internet down to iPhones. For home users, Apple planned to offer antennas people could stick to their windows to disperse their internet connection throughout the building. (Satellite internet requires a device to have an uninterrupted line of sight to the sky.) For the project’s champions, it was an ambitious gambit to provide a more seamless Apple experience. Some inside Apple saw mobile carriers as necessary but inconvenient partners that held the company’s iPhone plans back. With a global satellite system, Apple could provide more of the key ingredients for its products, reducing its dependency on outside partners. The lead executive and architect behind the project was Apple’s longtime wireless chief, Rubén Caballero. Apple spent around $36 million testing out the concept at a secret location in El Segundo, Calif., the people with knowledge of the project said. The team aimed to launch the service in 2019. But eventually Apple got cold feet. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, was concerned that the project would jeopardize the company’s relationship with the telecom industry, said people with direct knowledge of the project. It was also an expensive undertaking with an unclear near-term business case. At the end of 2016, Apple canceled the project. (Caballero left the company in 2019.) The segment I quote here is midway through the article. It leads with purported offers from Elon Musk to Apple to rely exclusively on Starlink for satellite networking. Starlink offers a genuinely incredible service. But there’s no way Apple was going to make a get into bed together deal with Elon Musk. Starlink’s technology and satellite coverage are extraordinary, but Musk personally is just too erratic. It’s a bizarre, dare I say unprecedented, combination. He’s like Howard Hughes but with much better tech (and, perhaps, fewer bottles of his own urine strewn about his bedroom). ★ Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley (recently of the WSJ) and Wayne Ma, at the paywalled-up-the-wazoo The Information: Starting in 2015, Apple and Boeing held early discussions about a satellite internet project that would involve delivering full-blown wireless internet service, not just emergency communications services, to iPhones and homes, said five people involved in or briefed on the project.

Starlink offers a genuinely incredible service. But there’s no way Apple was going to make a get into bed together deal with Elon Musk. Starlink’s technology and satellite coverage are extraordinary, but Musk personally is just too erratic. It’s a bizarre, dare I say unprecedented, combination. He’s like Howard Hughes but with much better tech (and, perhaps, fewer bottles of his own urine strewn about his bedroom). ★",

        "description": "Both Musi and Apple seek sanctions as fight over App Store removal intensifies. For millions of music fans, the most controversial app ban of the past year was not the brief TikTok outage but the ongoing delisting of Musi from Apple's App Store. Those users are holding out hope that Musi can defeat Apple in court and soon be reinstated. However, rather than coming to any sort of resolution, that court fight has intensified over the past month, with both sides now seeking sanctions, TorrentFreak reported. Musi is a free app that lets users stream music from YouTube without interruptions, only playing ads when the app is initially opened. It was removed from the App Store in September 2024 after a YouTube complaint, but it maintains a deeply loyal fan base who swear it's better than alternatives like Spotify. Those fans who still have the app installed on their iPhones can continue to use the service, but if they lose access to the app (by updating their phones) or are first-time users, it is currently unavailable for download, to the dismay of many fans who complain daily on Reddit.Read full article Comments",

Apple says its App Store prevented more than $2 billion in fraudulent transactions last year. This is part of a larger anti-fraud effort that has blocked more than $9 billion worth of such transactions in the past five years, the tech giant said Thursday (May 27). “Preserving the App Store’s safe and secure marketplace requires constant vigilance, as bad actors continue to evolve their tactics in an attempt to defraud users,” Apple said in a news release. “These threats range from deceptive apps designed to steal personal information to fraudulent payment schemes that attempt to exploit users” the company added. “Apple employs a comprehensive approach to combating fraud on the App Store, with teams across the company working to detect, investigate, and prevent malicious activity before it can reach users.” According to the release, Apple terminated more than 146,000 developer accounts last year due to fraud concerns and rejected an additional 139,000 developer enrollments, keeping fraudsters from submitting their apps to the App Store. In addition, the company’s App Review program removed more than 37,000 apps in 2024 for fraudulent activity. Apple also removed more than 143 million fraudulent ratings and reviews from the App Store last year, as well as more than 7,400 apps from App Store charts, while keeping nearly 9,500 deceptive apps from appearing in App Store search results. “These actions in turn benefit developers who are in good standing, leveling the playing field and allowing them a fair chance to thrive on the App Store,” the company said. In other fraud prevention news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the trend of consumers shunning plastic cards for their virtual counterparts in a bid to stay ahead of cybercriminals. According to findings from the PYMNTS Intelligence/Elan report “Digital Payments Evolution: Virtual Cards Poised to Take Off,” 42% of U.S. consumers used a virtual card in the last six months, while a staggering 65% reported they are likely to use one within the next year. “What’s driving the growth? It’s more than one in three consumers (36%) who have experienced fraud that are now more likely to use the payment method,” PYMNTS wrote. “The shift reflects a significant behavioral transformation: one catalyzed by consumers’ desire for security, flexibility and control in an era where fraud and data breaches are no longer hypotheticals but personal realities for millions.” The post Apple: App Store Blocked $2 Billion in Fraud Last Year appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Texas is reportedly closer to instituting age verification standards for Apple and Google’s app stores. As Reuters reported Tuesday (May 27), a bill requiring the two tech giants to verify users’ ages could become law in Texas this week, awaiting Governor Greg Abbott’s signature after passing both houses of the state legislature. The legislation says that if users are under the age of 18, they must get parental permission to download apps or make in-app purchases. Apple and Google have opposed the bill, arguing it imposes blanket requirements to turn over age data to all apps, even uncontroversial ones. The report notes that the debate around age restrictions has led to conflict between Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, and Apple and Google. During a U.S. Senate hearing last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that he believed parents should not “have to upload an ID or proof they are a parent in every single app that their children use. The easier place to do this is in the app stores themselves.” According to Reuters, child safety groups have backed the bill after years of campaigning for app store age verification. “The problem is that self-regulation in the digital marketplace has failed, where app stores have just prioritized the profit over safety and rights of children and families,” Casey Stefanski, executive director for the Digital Childhood Alliance, told Reuters. Utah has passed similar legislation, while app store age verification bills have been introduced in other states, including Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Mexico, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia. Anxiety and mental health issues among children have skyrocketed as a result of young people gaining access to content, misinformation, and disturbing presentations, Intellicheck CEO Bryan Lewis told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster in an interview in January. “You can name so many websites,” he told Webster, “whether it’s TikTok or a gun manufacturer, alcohol or pornography site … so many of them just say, ‘Are you 18 or over’ or ‘Are you 13 and over? Click this button.’ There’s no proof.” Lewis argued that state and federal laws need to change and that the mantra should be “prove, prove, prove … trust but verify.” Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has found that social media has become a key part of life for most consumers. This is especially true for Generation Z consumers, 92% of whom say they check social media multiple times each day, according to the report, “Generation Zillennial: How Social Media Drives Zillennials’ Purchases.” The post Texas Set to Impose App Store Age Verification Rules appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Bank of America analysts this week even called Google's slew of new AI announcements a \"Trojan horse\" for its device business.For years, Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out. Apple leads in the US in phone sales, though it still trails Android globally. The two have also gradually converged; iOS has become more customizable, while Android has become cleaner and easier to use. As hardware upgrades have slowed in recent years, the focus has shifted to the smarts inside the device.That could be a big problem for Apple. Its AI rollouts have proven lackluster with users, while more enticing promised features have been delayed. The company is reportedly trying to rebuild Siri entirely using large language models. Right now, it's still behind Google and OpenAI, and that gap continues to widen.During Google's I/O conference this week, the search giant bombarded us with new AI features. Perhaps the best example was a particularly grabby demo of Google's \"Project Astra\" assistant helping someone fix their bike by searching through the bike manual, pulling up a YouTube video, and calling a bike shop to see if certain supplies were in stock.It was, of course, a highly polished promotional video, but it made Siri look generations behind.\"It has long been the case that the best way to bring products to the consumer market is via devices, and that seems truer than ever,\" wrote Ben Thompson, analyst and Stratechery author, in an I/O dispatch this week.\"Android is probably going to be the most important canvas for shipping a lot of these capabilities,\" he added.Google's golden opportunityApple has done a good job of locking users into its ecosystem with iMessage blue bubbles, features like FaceTime, and peripherals like the Apple Watch that require an iPhone to use.Google's Pixel phone line, meanwhile, remains a rounding error when compared to global smartphone shipments. That's less of a problem when Google has huge partners like Samsung that bring all of its AI features to billions of Android users globally.While iPhone users will get some of these new features through Google's iOS apps, it's clear that the \"universal assistant\" the company is building will only see its full potential on Android. Perhaps this could finally get iOS users to make the switch.\"We're seeing diminishing returns on a hardware upgrade cycle, which means we're now really focused on the software upgrade cycle,\" Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Business Insider.Without major changes by Apple, Shmulik said he sees the gap in capabilities between Android and iOS only widening.\"If it widens to the point where someone with an iPhone says, 'Well my phone can't do that,' does it finally cause that switching event from what everyone has always considered this incredible lock-in from Apple?\" Shmulik said.Beyond smartphonesInternally, Google has been preparing for this moment.The company merged its Pixel, Chrome, and Android teams last year to capitalize on the AI opportunity.\"We are going to be very fast-moving to not miss this opportunity,\" Google's Android chief Sameer Samat told BI at last year's I/O. \"It's a once-in-a-generation moment to reinvent what phones can do. We are going to seize that moment.\"A year on, Google appears to be doing just that. Much of what the company demoed this week is either rolling out to devices imminently or in the coming weeks.Google still faces the challenge that its relationships with partners like Samsung have come with the express promise that Google won't give its home-grown devices preferential treatment. So, if Google decides to double down on its Pixel phones at the expense of its partners, it could step into a business land mine.Of course, Google needs to think about more than smartphones. Its renewed bet on XR glasses is a bet on what might be the next-generation computing platform. Meta is already selling its own augmented reality glasses, and Apple is now doubling down on its efforts to get its own smart glasses out by the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported.Google this week demoed glasses that have a visual overlay to instantly provide information to wearers, which Meta's glasses lack and Apple's first version will reportedly also not have.The success of Meta's glasses so far is no doubt encouraging news for Google, as a new era of AI devices is ushered in. Now it's poised to get ahead by leveraging its AI chops, and Apple might give it the exact opening it's waited more than a decade for.\"I don't know about an open goal,\" said Shmulik of Apple, \"but it does feel like they've earned themselves a penalty kick.\"Have something to share?

        "description": "In the first three months of 2025, Xiaomi climbed back to the top of the global wearable market, moving ahead of Apple by focusing on affordable bands that deliver useful features, that is according to Canalys data. The overall market also showed signs of strength, with total shipments rising to 46.6 million units—a 13 percent increase compared to the same period last year.That growth didn’t come from flashy smartwatches, but mostly from basic bands. These simpler devices are getting popular again, especially in parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, where price plays a bigger role in buying decisions. Xiaomi took advantage of that shift.The company shipped 8.7 million wearables in the quarter, marking a 44 percent jump from last year. Its success wasn’t tied to one model alone, but the new Redmi Band stood out. More importantly, Xiaomi’s software now links its phones, watches, and home devices into a single system, giving users a better experience without raising prices.Apple, by contrast, had a quieter quarter. It shipped 7.6 million Apple Watches, growing just 5 percent. The product still sells well in higher-income markets, but recent models haven’t changed much, and some buyers may be holding off for something more exciting. A bigger update is expected later this year, possibly to mark the tenth anniversary of the device.Huawei stayed close behind with 7.1 million units, thanks to steady demand for its GT and Fit watches and broader use of its health app outside China. Samsung made the biggest leap among top brands, growing 74 percent year-over-year to 4.9 million shipments. It found success by splitting its strategy—offering basic models in price-sensitive markets while also selling more advanced watches elsewhere.Garmin, though smaller in volume, held onto its niche. It shipped 1.8 million devices, up 10 percent from last year, continuing to attract fitness-focused users who prefer specialized tools.For now, Xiaomi’s push into affordable, connected wearables has paid off. It understood where the market was headed and moved early, building a product line that meets real needs without inflating the price tag.Read next:• Nearly Half Of Americans, Particularly Millennials, Worry About Online Privacy But Continue Using Data-hungry Apps• AI Shows Surprising Skill in Handling Emotionally Charged Situations, Study Finds",

        "description": "Former Apple design chief Jony Ive sold his hardware startup io to OpenAI for nearly $6.5 billion.BI IllustrationFormer Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are building a mystery ChatGPT device.The interwebs have come alive with gadget guesses, renders, and memes.OpenAI is trying to challenge Apple and Google by redefining AI interaction with new hardware.Let's get something out of the way first: nobody really knows what former Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are building.That hasn't stopped the internet from bursting at the seams with wild guesses, gorgeous renders, speculative hot takes, and a healthy dose of meme-fueled imagination.So, what is this mystery device that Ive is cooking up for OpenAI's ChatGPT? A screenless wearable? A next-gen smart assistant? A pocketable AI oracle? A glorified paperweight?Here's our roundup of the best guesses — serious, speculative, satirical, and everything in between. Thank you to my Business Insider colleagues for contributing to this Friday's fun.Serious Guesses: Industry Analyst Weighs InOK fine. We'll start with some serious ideas.TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is a credible source in the tech hardware and supply-chain space, especially when it comes to Apple. His take on the Ive-OpenAI gadget is valuable:Form Factor: Think small. Maybe iPod Shuffle-sized. Portable, minimal, and delightfully Ive-ish.Wearable: One of the use cases includes wearing it around your neck. Shades of sci-fi, Star Trek, or perhaps a Tamagotchi on steroids?No Screen: It will have cameras and mics for environmental awareness but no display. The idea is to not add another screen to our lives.Companion Device: It will connect to your smartphone or laptop for processing and visual output.Production Timeline: Mass production is expected in 2027, giving us plenty of time for more leaks, renders, and conspiracy theories.Kuo suggested on X that the announcement was timed to shift attention away from Google I/O. OpenAI positioned this as a new hardware-software narrative, riding the trend of \"physical AI.\"He also referenced a great quote from former Apple fellow Alan Kay: \"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\" That's exactly what Altman and OpenAI are trying to do here.Clues from Altman and WSJOpenAI CEO Sam Altman.Kim Hong-Ji/REUTERSThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that Altman offered OpenAI staff a preview of the devices he's building with Ive:The device was described as an AI \"companion.\" Altman wants to ship 100 million of them on day one.It will be aware of its surroundings and fit in your pocket or sit on your desk.It's not a phone or smart glasses. Ive reportedly wasn't keen on a wearable, though the final design may still flirt with that concept.Altman said the device should be the third major object on your desk, alongside a MacBook and iPhone.There will be a \"family of devices,\" and Altman even floated the idea of mailing subscribers new ChatGPT-powered computers.They aim to shift away from screen-based interaction and rethink what AI companionship really means in a day-to-day human context.Renders, memes, and vibesThe brilliant designer Ben Geskin imagined several cool form factors on X, including this circular disc.io pic.twitter.com/bcpyixWcle— Ben Geskin (@BenGeskin) May 23, 2025Geskin's ideas blend Apple-grade minimalism with futuristic whimsy, perfectly on brand for Jony Ive.Some smart glasses, because of course.A dangly dongle, equal parts techie and jewelry.Square/rectangular objects with eerie elegance.What form factor do you think makes the most sense for OpenAI’s first AI device? I’m all in for glasses ",

What do you think of this week's pick? What should I do, or use, next week? Let me know.I met Dan Fitzpatrick at Google I/O. He's a Tech Memo subscriber and expert on AI for education. We discussed how he uses generative AI, particularly how he creates podcasts from his research. Here's one he did this week in which he talks about meeting Google CEO Sundar Pichai. This was his workflow:Record a voice memo on his phone.Put that into Google's Gemini chatbot and ask it to create a transcript.Ask Gemini to try again and keep the words closer to how Dan spoke in the audio file.Upload the transcript to a speech AI service called ElevenLabs in three batches.ElevenLabs turned this into a new audio file of Dan speaking in his distinct style.Dan edited the audio in TikTok's CapCut tool and published it on LinkedIn as a podcast.\"I also add the jingles in CapCut,\" he told me.Not to be outdone, I created a podcast, too. I asked Charles and Pranav for some of their top Google I/O takeaways. I put that text into a Google Doc and added it to Google's NotebookLM AI tool.

        "description": "President Donald Trump is threatening Apple with a 25% tariff if the tech giant doesn’t start producing iPhones in the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, Trump said he had “long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.” “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” he added. An Apple spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to Fast Company‘s request for comment. It’s the latest company to be caught up in the administration’s aggressive tariff policies. Walmart, for example, drew the president’s ire after it warned consumers last week that it may have to raise prices due to cost pressures. For its part, Apple has been working to diversify its production for the more than 60 million iPhones it sells in the U.S. annually. The vast majority of Apple products are made in China, though the company is reportedly working to move production for most of its U.S.-bound iPhones to India. Still, Trump’s threat spooked investors. Shares of Apple fell more than 2% on the news, as iPhones could become incredibly pricey. Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives said in a note to clients that it would take five to 10 years to shift production to the U.S. and phones could end up costing $3,500. New iPhones, without all the bells and whistles, currently go for around $800. “We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives wrote.",

        "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday made new trade threats against the European Union and iPhone maker Apple. The post Trump threatens tariffs on European Union, iPhones appeared first on FreightWaves. President Donald Trump on Friday said he is “recommending” a 50% tariff on the European Union after stalled trade negotiations with the bloc of 27 member countries. The new import duties on goods from the EU would start on June 1, Trump wrote on Truth Social. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with. Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,” Trump said. The European Commission, the primary executive arm of the EU, has not made an official response to Trump’s recommendation for 50% tariffs. Related: White House says China trade deal reached after ‘productive’ talks The Trump administration imposed a 20% “reciprocal” tariff on most EU goods on April 2 but later paused the levy until July 8 to allow time for negotiations. The EU and all other countries still have a 10% baseline duty on all exported goods to the U.S. The White House is also still maintaining 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts and is threatening similar action on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods from the EU. Trump also said Friday he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unless it shifts some iPhone production to the U.S. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump said on social media. As of Friday, Apple had declined to comment on Trump’s post. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that Apple was finalizing plans for a $1.5 billion iPhone component production center in India.

This week marked three major developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Microsoft is making Windows agentic, while OpenAI is developing AI-native devices with former Apple designer Jony Ive. Meanwhile, Google is embedding agentic checkout in Search. Here’s this week’s AI roundup. Agentic Transformation of Windows Microsoft is re-architecting Windows as an agentic AI platform, ushering in one of the most significant overhauls in the operating system’s history. This move is a key part of the company’s strategy to build the technical foundation for an open, agent-driven web. Speaking at Microsoft Build 2025, CEO Satya Nadella said he believes generative AI has now reached the stage where AI agents will proliferate. “In 2025, we’re building out this open agentic web at scale,” he said. Microsoft also unveiled NLWeb, which can turn any website into an agentic website. This enables any business to offer customers an AI agent experience. Read more: Microsoft’s Radical Bet Turns Windows Into an AI Playground OpenAI Is Acquiring Jony Ive’s Startup Io OpenAI is acquiring io, an AI devices startup founded by former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and other Apple designers, for $6.4 billion in equity. Io will become the hardware division of OpenAI, tapping into the creative genius of Ive, who as Steve Job’s protégé led the design of the iPhone, iPod, Apple Watch and other hardware. Altman wants to reinvent devices for the AI era, lamenting that it takes several cumbersome steps today to access ChatGPT: Turn on the computer, open a web browser, go to ChatGPT’s website, type in a prompt and wait for an answer. He thinks there’s a better way. Ive, for his part, called Altman a “rare visionary.” Read more: OpenAI Acquires Jony Ive’s AI Device Startup for $6.4B Google Embeds Agentic Checkout in Search Google unveiled new shopping capabilities in Search designed to compete with AI chatbots increasingly used for eCommerce. At this week’s Google I/O conference, the company announced that Search’s AI Mode will soon help users browse products, try on clothing virtually, and receive price alerts. These upgrades aim to simplify online shopping and personalize the experience. Google also introduced “agentic checkout,” enabling Search to add items to a cart and complete purchases either with user confirmation or autonomously. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 AI model, these features will roll out in the coming months. This makeover is part of Google’s plan to transform Search into one integrated AI assistant. “This is the future of Google Search, a search that goes beyond information to intelligence,” said Elizabeth Reid, head of Google Search. Read more: Google to Embed Agentic Checkout, Virtual Try-on in Search AI-Run Company Misses Expectations Carnegie Mellon researchers created a virtual software company run entirely by AI agents, just to see how they would do. The result: While agents were good at highly cerebral tasks, they failed in simple ones that are intuitive to humans — like waiting 10 minutes before escalating a task or closing a pop-up window. In their research paper, the team let LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others interact with the AI agents in the company to see how they would do. The best performer was Anthropic’s Claude, but it only completed 24% of tasks — still an ‘F’ grade in any school. Read more: Are AI Agents Ready to Take Over Human Work? New Study Says Not Yet Arm Eyes Intel’s Market Share Arm is making a push into the PC market, projecting that it would capture 40% of PCs and tablets shipped this year with its power-efficient architecture, which already powers 99% of smartphones. While Intel still dominates in devices like Chromebooks, Arm is gaining ground as AI reshapes personal computing. In an exclusive interview with PYMNTS, Chris Bergey, head of Arm’s client line of business, said the company’s energy-efficient designs give it an edge in the AI era, especially for devices processing AI workloads locally. Edge computing, which enhances privacy, reduces latency and cuts cloud costs, is becoming essential in PCs, positioning Arm as a key player in next-generation AI-enabled devices.

President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Apple and the European Union in Friday (May 23) posts on Truth Social. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote in one post. “If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company and other smartphone manufacturers have increased the share of U.S.-bound product shipments from India to avoid tariffs placed on imports from China, Counterpoint Technology Market Research said May 14. India’s share of U.S.-bound shipments of smartphones rose from 16% in the first quarter of 2024 to 26% in the first quarter of 2025. It was reported April 25 that in response to new tariffs on China, Apple plans to get all its U.S.-bound iPhones from India by the end of 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News Friday that Trump aims to bring precision manufacturing back to the U.S. and that external production of semiconductors creates a vulnerability for the country. “So, we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure,” Bessent told Fox News in a video shared on social platform X by the White House’s Rapid Response 47 account. .@SecScottBessent: “@POTUS is trying to bring back precision manufacturing to the U.S. … So, we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.” pic.twitter.com/VGNAXtO2gi — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) May 23, 2025 In another Friday post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the European Union has been “very difficult to deal with” and that its trade barriers, VAT taxes, corporate penalties, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations and lawsuits against American companies have led to a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere,” Trump wrote in the post. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” Reuters reported that the European Commission “sought clarity” from the U.S. after Trump’s announcement and that commission trade representatives are scheduled to talk with their U.S. counterparts Friday. The EU already faces 25% tariffs on some goods and 10% on almost all the rest, according to the report.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty ImagesStocks dropped on Friday as investors digested Trump's latest tariff threats.The president said Apple could be hit with 25% tariffs, while threatening 50% against the EU.Bond yields were stable but the greenback tumbled, with the dollar index dipping 0.5%.US stocks fell ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, with investors reacting to the latest trade war rhetoric from President Donald Trump.Here's where major indexes stood at 10:10 a.m. in New York on Friday:S&P 500: 5,790.45, down 0.9%Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,577.07, down 0.8% (312 points)Nasdaq Composite: 18,705.35, down 0.9%Trump said on Friday that Apple would be subject to a 25% tariff if it did not make iPhones in the US, and \"not in India, or anyplace else.\"Meanwhile, the president said in a separate post that he would recommend a 50% tariff on the European Union starting on June 1.\"The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,\" Trump wrote.Going beyond stocks, the US dollar index dropped as much as 0.8% on Friday.The fresh tariff threats have re-escalated the trade war right as investors were feeling as though the worst of the chaos may be over. Softer rhetoric and the US and China's deal to lower tariffs for 90 days have helped the S&P 500 rally almost 11% in a month, though this week's panic over the budget deficit has added a new layer of worry to the market.Bond yields were lower on Friday, sparked by investors' fleeing to safety as stocks were rattled by tariff fears.\"I think as we get closer to the end of this 90-day window for these trade negotiations, the market is really going to start focusing on tariffs more and more,\" Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told Business Insider. Trump's tariff pause is due to end on July 9.Markets were also assessing new comments from a top Federal Reserve official on the outlook for rates.\"If we can get the tariffs down close to the 10% and then that's all sealed, done and delivered somewhere by July, then we're in good shape for the second half of the year, and then we're in a good position to kind of move with rate cuts through the second half of the year,\" Waller said in an interview on Fox Business.Hickey noted that Waller is known to be a dove, so his comments aren't wholly surprising. He added that bond investors may be encouraged by the Supreme Court ruling that insulated Fed Chair Jerome Powell even as the high court said Trump could fire other agency heads.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Apple did not immediately […] The post Report: Apple to Introduce AI-Enhanced Smart Glasses in Late 2026 appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple reportedly plans to introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced smart glasses that would compete with Meta’s Ray-Bans. The company aims to produce a large quantity of prototypes by the end of the year and then release the smart glasses at the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported Thursday (May 22), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, the smart glasses are expected to be fitted with cameras, microphones, speakers and the Siri voice assistant. They will be able to handle phone calls, play music, provide live translations and deliver turn-by-turn directions. Further in the future, years from now, the company aims to release glasses equipped with augmented reality, per the report. The smart glasses project is part of a broader effort by Apple to develop a “breakthrough AI product,” the report said. The company has also worked on adding cameras to its Apple Watch smart watches and its AirPods earbuds so that those devices can gather more information, according to the report. However, Apple shut down the work on smart watches this week, while continuing the project involving earbuds, per the report. A new wave of next-generation smart glasses has emerged, driven by AI, PYMNTS reported in March. Meta, Amazon, Snap, Samsung, Baidu, Xiaomi, Google and about a dozen smaller companies are betting on smart glasses to be the next popular connected wearable. Google said Tuesday (May 20) that it expects smart glasses equipped with its extended reality (XR) operating system, Android XR, and its AI model, Gemini, to become a convenient and always present AI assistant. The firm said this while announcing that it has partnered with eyewear brands Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create Android XR-equipped glasses that are stylish and comfortable enough to wear all day. On Wednesday (May 21), OpenAI said it was acquiring an AI device startup co-founded by Jony Ive, the former chief design officer at Apple who led the design of the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Io will become the devices division at OpenAI and plans show “what they’ve been working on” in 2026.

        "description": "Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week here. OpenAI will acquire the AI device startup co-founded by Apple veteran Jony Ive and Sam Altman, called “io,” for nearly $6.5 billion, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. This almost certainly will put OpenAI in the consumer hardware business, and it seems like it will soon release a dedicated personal AI device. Ive is a pedigreed design guru with a track record of creating iconic tech products like the iPhone and the Apple Watch. Ive, a close friend of Steve Jobs, left Apple in 2019. “I have a growing sense that everything I’ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,” Ive told Bloomberg. Coming from the world’s best device designer, that’s saying a lot. OpenAI brings a lot to the table, too. After setting off the AI boom with the late 2022 release of ChatGPT, the startup has quickly built its chatbot into a mass market AI app and a household name. More than 400 million people around the world now use ChatGPT every week, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap recently told CNBC. (For comparison, longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster estimates that there are 1.7 billion Apple device users and 2.35 billion active devices worldwide.) “OpenAI has all of the core leadership and the best-in-class models, as well as some of the most widely used interfaces,” says Gartner analyst Chirag Dekate. “ChatGPT has defined and set the bar for what early experiences of generative AI ought to look like,” Dekate says. Ive helped Apple set such standards for smartphones and smartwatches. Apple’s traditional power was its mastery of the user interface—–the technology that mediates between a human user and their digital tools and content. But iOS devices evolved from roots in traditional computing. AI models operate in a fundamentally different way, and may require a fundamentally different UX. (Apple, which has struggled to empower its devices with new generative AI capabilities, saw its stock price drop as much as 2.3% on news of the io deal Wednesday.) OpenAI will now get an opportunity to define the ideal software-hardware fusion for the new computing paradigm it helped usher in—after high-profile flops like Humane’s AI pin. “AI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Bloomberg. Ive’s and Altman’s design firm has so far given the world no clue of its vision for a personal AI device. But whatever it builds—–a pendant or a bracelet or some kind of glasses—–will very likely provide an influential blueprint for how a vehicle for personal AI should look in the future. “Jony Ive and io joining OpenAI is so important: It calls out the fact that in order to truly diffuse generative AI across society, we need to build new hardware experiences,” Dekate says. “The QWERTY keyboard may not be the best way to experience generative AI.” Google got its AI mojo back Google looks like a company that’s got its mojo back. Yes, yes, I know . . . the company still faces some very big problems—–antitrust actions, changes in its core search business, etc.—–but it also seems to have fully woken up to the AI revolution it helped start, and seems to be navigating it with level-headedness and even a sense of fun. The company’s two-hour keynote at its developer event in Mountain View Tuesday was all about AI, a showcase for a comprehensive strategy of applying the company’s Gemini AI models broadly across its product portfolio—–to everything from search tools to coding agents to video generators to smart glasses. Remember that Google is a company that entered the AI race only reluctantly in 2023, in the wake of the ChatGPT launch. Even though it was Google researchers who figured out how to architect and train the type of large language models that power ChatGPT, the company was, for legal and safety reasons, deeply conflicted about exposing such models to the public. But after OpenAI, Microsoft, and others hurried to apply and commercialize LLMs, Google found itself on the back foot, punished by Wall Street for not leading the race: a lackluster February 2023 demo of the Bard chatbot caused an 8% drop in Alphabet stock. Google’s biggest announcement Tuesday may mark the moment when it retook the lead—–with a new AI product that could remake its core search business. “AI Mode,” a chatbot-format AI search tool that will compete directly against ChatGPT and Perplexity, went from being an experimental product to being available to all users. It’s powered by Google’s best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. In AI Mode, rather than entering a search term or phrase, users can describe in detail what they’re looking for (often a solution to a problem rather than just some facts) and then work with Gemini’s reasoning abilities to get to a fully responsive package of custom information. Features from the company’s Project Astra work will increasingly let the AI gather information about objects (or problems) it sees (through a phone camera or smart glasses) in the real world around the user. Its work in Project Mariner will give AI more and more power to operate the user’s device and call on various web tools (mapping, live weather, etc.) on the user’s behalf. This summer AI Mode will be able to book appointments on the user’s behalf, do deep research projects and data visualization, and help people shop for clothing and other products. The Gemini Live mode in the Gemini app leverages some of the same technologies. Google’s Demis Hassabis described the experimental project as a universal AI assistant powered by a “world model” that understands the context in which the user is moving, and understands a certain amount about how the physics of the world works, and can plan and take action on behalf of the user. In the demo video during I/O, a young man talks to the assistant while fixing a bicycle. Through the phone camera, the Gemini Live identifies problems and replacement parts, places a phone call to order a part, looks up schematics on the web, and makes suggestions. It can also control a user’s device, analyze video, share its screen, and remember everything it sees or discusses in a session. Google has always been a medium between humans and all the data and intelligence that resides on the public web. No other company has as much experience accessing, parsing, organizing, and packaging all that information. Google believes that AI can make that medium a lot smarter, proactive, and personalized. And the power of Gemini goes well beyond search to best-in-class video/audio generation tools (Veo 3, Flow) to coding assistants (Jules) and to wearables (Android XR glasses). Anthropic debuts new generation of Claude models Anthropic on Thursday debuted the fourth generation of its AI models with Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which the company says push the state of the art for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents. Both can use tools, such as web search. The company says Claude Opus 4 is its best model and the best coding model in the world. The model can work for several hours straight on complex, long-running tasks that involve thousands of steps, Anthropic says, and significantly expands what AI agents can accomplish. Claude Sonnet 4 replaces Anthropic’s previous best effort, Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The company says the new model does everything 3.7 did, but pushes the envelope further on coding, reasoning, and precise instruction following. Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid models offering two modes: near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning. Both models are available on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. Claude Sonnet 4 is also available in the free version of the Claude chatbot. The new models use chain-of-thought processing, as Claude 3.7 Sonnet did. But instead of displaying the model’s raw thought process to users, Anthropic now shows summaries of the models’ reasoning steps. Anthropic says it made this change “to preserve visibility for users while better securing our models.” Anthropic’s competitors could potentially use the raw chain-of-thought output to train their own models. While Anthropic’s models are used to power a number of commercial coding assistants, the company has its own assistant, Claude Code, which it released as a research preview earlier this year. The assistant is now generally available. Anthropic says it’ll start to release model updates more frequently in an effort to “continuously refine and enhance” its models.

In that time, he received countless awards and accolades for his ingenuity and commitment to Apple's minimalist design aesthetic. Ive's success at Apple made him a household name and catapulted him into pop culture discourse.Here's all you need to know.Early life and educationIve grew up in Chingford, a suburb of London.ilbusca/Getty ImagesJonathan Paul Ive was born on February 27, 1967, in Chingford, England, a suburb of London. His father was a silversmith, and his mother was a psychotherapist. While attending secondary school, Ive was diagnosed with dyslexia. Ive studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic, now called Northumbria University.Jony Ive's rise at AppleApple crew left to right: Phil Schiller, Tony Fadell, Jony Ive, Steve Jobs, Scott Forstall, Eddy CueJonathan Sprague/ReduxAfter a brief stint at Acme Corp., Ive joined Apple in 1992. Ive had already made a name for himself by then, and it took Apple's design leader, Bob Brunner, years to recruit him.Once he joined, he quickly rose through the ranks and became Senior VP of Design after Steve Jobs became CEO in 1997. Jobs' first major assignment for Ive was the classic, candy-colored iMac. Ive went on to lead the design on Apple's biggest products, including the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. Ive maintained creative oversight over the design of Apple's products and worked with CEO Tim Cook to launch new products like the Apple Watch.While Jobs was famously tough to get along with, Ive has said his best years at Apple were with Jobs. Ive described his time working with Jobs at Apple from 1997 to 2011 as \"the most joyful and extraordinary 15 years of my life.\" He also said the two ate lunch together \"every day of the week,\" went on family vacations, and had continuous conversations about design.In May 2015, Ive was promoted to the role of chief design officer at Apple. From 2015 to 2017, Ive focused on Apple's new headquarters, the Apple Park \"spaceship,\" for which he designed most of the little details. Ive regained direct control of Apple's design team in 2017. In June 2019, Apple announced that Ive was leaving the company after 27 years.Ive said he left because the projects he'd been working closely on were completed, in an interview with the Financial Times at the time. He also told the outlet, \"I think that part of the timing for LoveFrom is in some ways connected to having a very clear sense about the health and vitality of the design team,\" Ives said to the financial newspaper. \"I'm actually looking forward to contributing in a different way to projects we've been working together on for, in some cases, many years.\"Ive's design philosophyThe cornerstone of Ive's success is his unique design philosophy.Over more than two decades at Apple, Ive led the design of iconic Apple products like the iMac in 1998, iPhone in 2007, and Apple Watch in 2014 — shaping everything from hardware and software to packaging, retail stores, and even Apple's campus.Ive said in an interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison that his ideas and work at Apple were often inspired by Dieter Rams, the German industrial designer who had a \"less but better\" approach.He's also said that whenever he starts working on a project, he thinks about the utility of a product and then he begins to consider what it will actually look like.And he spends a lot of time on research. To ensure he created the right color tones for the iMac, Ive talked with jelly bean manufacturers. To learn how to make super-thin metal for laptops, he sought out Japanese metalworkers.Ultimately, he makes products that care about functionality and design. In a profile of Ive in Time he said, \"We're surrounded by anonymous, poorly made objects. It's tempting to think it's because the people who use them don't care — just like the people who make them. But what we've shown is that people do care. It's not just about aesthetics. They care about things that are thoughtfully conceived and well-made. We make and sell a very, very large number of (hopefully) beautiful, well-made things. Our success is a victory for purity, integrity — for giving a damn.\"Career post-AppleIve launched his own independent design company called LoveFrom in 2019 with his fellow designer Marc Newson. The company counted Apple and Airbnb among its early clients. Ive and LoveFrom plan to continue to work closely with OpenAI but remain independent, a company spokesperson told BI.Last year, Ive launched io, as part of a joint project between LoveFrom and OpenAI, Wired reported. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Io and OpenAI agreed for OpenAI to receive a 23% stake in io.Now, it's fully acquiring the firm.\"It became clear that our ambitions to develop, engineer, and manufacture a new family of products demanded an entirely new company,\" Altman and Ive wrote in a post on OpenAI's website.Awards and recognitionIve has received numerous design awards and honorary degrees for this work.In May 2012 he was named a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to design. He was knighted in Buckingham Palace by Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter and said the experience was \"absolutely thrilling.\"He's received awards, including San Francisco MoMA's Lifetime Achievement Award, Inaugural Medal, the Benjamin Franklin Medal, the President's Award, the Royal Academy of Engineering's President's Medal, and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's Product Design Award.He also holds honorary degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.Personal lifeA London native, Ive now lives near Apple's headquarters, having purchased a $17 million, four-bedroom home in Pacific Heights — on a stretch known, fittingly, as \"Billionaire's Row.\" He's also frequently spotted at local clubs.Like many tech executives, he owns a beach house on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. A lifelong car enthusiast, Ive once helped his father restore an Austin-Healey Sprite, maintains a personal collection, and even bought Steve Jobs' former plane.Read the original article on Business Insider Jony Ive's career is taking a new turn, as he teams up with Sam Altman at OpenAI.Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox MediaFormer Apple design chief Jony Ive and his design firm LoveFrom will be taking over design at OpenAI.OpenAI is also acquiring Ive's startup io in a $6.5 billion deal.Here's all you need to know about Jony Ive.Jony Ive, Apple's longtime design chief, entered into a new partnership with OpenAI.Ive and his design firm LoveFrom will be leading creative and design at OpenAI, developing everything from devices to novel projects.

        "description": "When Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 in 2016, the backlash was immediate and fierce. Tech reviewers called it “user-hostile and stupid.” Customers created petitions. Competitors ran ads mocking the decision. Yet today, wireless earbuds are ubiquitous, and the decision looks prescient rather than foolish. What Apple understood—and what most future-ready leaders eventually learn—is that meaningful innovation requires disappointing people strategically. This isn’t the leadership advice you typically hear. We’re told to inspire, to build consensus, to bring everyone along. But an uncomfortable truth lurks beneath these platitudes: as your impact grows, so does your capacity to disappoint others. And rather than avoiding this reality, the most effective leaders learn to navigate it intentionally. When Success Creates an Expectation Trap Author Rebecca Solnit captures this paradox perfectly. After supporting a friend whose first book had become unexpectedly successful, she explained that “success is full of failures, at least in the eyes of others, who want things from you, more of them wanting more than you can ever deliver, so you live in an atmosphere of pressure, unmet expectation.” This is particularly acute in technology leadership, where decisions must often be made ahead of market readiness. The moment you create something valuable, people develop expectations about what should come next—expectations that frequently conflict with the very innovation that made your work valuable in the first place. Consider Netflix’s pivot from DVD delivery to streaming. When announced in 2011, the company lost 800,000 subscribers and its stock plummeted 77%. Today, that disappointing decision looks like the defining move that secured Netflix’s future. Confidence: Not What We Think It Is The paradox exists for leaders across industries, though. Part of the challenge is that we fundamentally misunderstand confidence. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman explains, “Subjective confidence in a judgment is not a reasoned evaluation of the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.” In other words, our feeling of confidence often has more to do with how neatly our story fits together than with its actual likelihood of being correct. This creates a dangerous dynamic in leadership, where seemingly “confident” decisions may simply reflect coherent but flawed narratives, especially when those narratives align with what stakeholders want to hear. This dynamic is especially dangerous in leadership, where the pressure to appear confident drives a pattern I’ve observed repeatedly: the rush to create strategies around emerging technologies (“What’s our AI strategy?” “What’s our blockchain strategy?”) rather than having the confidence to maintain core business strategies and incorporate new technologies experimentally. Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom’s concept of “insecure overachievers” illuminates part of this pattern: leaders who achieve at high levels while seeking external validation often prioritize appearing forward-leaning over being truly purposeful. The result? Decision-makers chasing technologies rather than outcomes, pursuing strategies that sound forward-thinking but may actually disconnect organizations from their core mission and meaningful impact. The Mathematics of Confident Decision-Making In statistics, confidence intervals don’t just tell us whether an effect exists—they reveal how certain we can be about what we know, which directly impacts our confidence to act. Mathematician Jordan Ellenberg illustrates this: a narrow confidence interval (such as between −0.5% and 0.5%) means you have “good evidence the intervention doesn’t do anything,” giving you the confidence to stop the initiative. A wide interval (such as between −20% and 20%) means you have “no idea whether the intervention has an effect,” signaling you need more data before making a decisive call. In other words, this statistical principle offers a powerful parallel for leadership decisions: true confidence comes not from eliminating uncertainty, but from understanding precisely what we know and what we don’t, and responding appropriately. This distinction offers us a powerful framework for leadership—what I call the Strategic Disappointment Matrix: Quadrant 1: High Certainty / Low Disappointment These are the easy wins—decisions where data strongly supports a path that few will object to. Pursue these enthusiastically, but recognize they rarely lead to breakthrough innovation. Quadrant 2: High Certainty / High Disappointment Here lie the necessary disappointments—decisions like sunsetting beloved but unsustainable products or implementing essential security measures that create friction. The evidence clearly shows these moves are necessary, even though they’ll create disappointment. These require courage, but clear communication can minimize backlash. Quadrant 3: Low Certainty / Low Disappointment These are experimental spaces where you can test hypotheses with minimal risk. These low-stakes experiments often yield what I call “bankable foresights”—insights about future priorities that you can invest in confidently even without complete certainty. Use these spaces intentionally to gather data that might eventually inform more consequential decisions in other quadrants. Quadrant 4: Low Certainty / High Disappointment This is where the biggest breakthroughs—and biggest failures—happen. When Airbnb suggested people rent their homes to strangers, or when Amazon invested in AWS, these decisions had uncertain outcomes and disappointed many stakeholders. These require the highest level of judgment and often define a leader’s legacy. Understanding where your decisions fall in this matrix doesn’t eliminate uncertainty, but it helps you respond to it appropriately. Practicing Strategic Disappointment Dr. McMillan Cottom suggests that developing comfort with disappointing others is “a critical life-skill” worth deliberately practicing. She recommends setting “the intention to disappoint at least one person, in some real way, over the next 24 hours,” noting that “the more comfortable you get with the risk of disappointing, the better things go on all fronts.” For leaders, this practice might include: Distinguish types of disappointment. Differentiate between disappointments that challenge people productively versus those that harm needlessly. Create transparent decision frameworks. Develop and communicate clear values hierarchies that show which principles take precedence when trade-offs become necessary. Articulate the “future-ready why.” Practice explaining unpopular decisions in terms of the longer horizon they enable, not just the immediate benefits. Build disappointment resilience. Develop personal practices that help you withstand the discomfort of being misunderstood or criticized for decisions you believe in. Measure meaningful impact. Create metrics that track long-term value creation, not just immediate satisfaction or engagement. Innovative Leadership Through Strategic Disappointment When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella decided to shift the company’s focus from Windows to cloud computing and AI, many were disappointed. Windows had been Microsoft’s crown jewel for decades. Developers, partners, and even internal teams who had built careers around the operating system felt betrayed by this pivot. But Nadella was practicing strategic disappointment. Rather than trying to please all stakeholders in the short term, he disappointed some intentionally to position Microsoft for long-term relevance. The results speak for themselves. Microsoft’s market cap has increased from roughly $300 billion when Nadella took over to over $3 trillion today, making it one of the world’s most valuable companies. More importantly, this shift has positioned Microsoft as a leader in AI and cloud computing—the very technologies shaping our future. Nadella’s strategic pivot demonstrates a crucial truth for future-ready leaders: disappointing people isn’t a leadership failure. It’s often the necessary price of meaningful innovation. The confidence to disappoint strategically isn’t about being certain you’re right. It’s about having the clarity to recognize when immediate approval conflicts with long-term impact, and the courage to choose impact even when it hurts. In a world moving too fast for perfect certainty, tomorrow’s most valuable leaders won’t be those who pleased everyone today. They’ll be those who had the courage to purposefully disappoint when necessary, navigating uncertainty not by avoiding it, but by embracing it as the necessary terrain of meaningful change.",

It already had a 23% stake in the company thanks to an exclusive partnership it signed in the fourth quarter of last year.Once the deal closes, which is expected to happen later this summer, the 55-person team behind io will join OpenAI, to be led by Peter Welinder. (Kalinowski will now report to Welinder rather than Altman.)Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom, will take on a major design role for OpenAI, though LoveFrom will remain independent and continue working on some other projects.The big picture: Other big tech companies have also been investing in a post-smartphone hardware future.While investor interest in the metaverse has cooled, there's still a competitive market in VR headsets and a growing field of smart glasses as a delivery device for AI services.Meta has its Ray-Ban Smart glasses. Google demonstrated its own prototype glasses, which include a small display. And Apple is reportedly working on augmented-reality glasses, too.The intrigue: OpenAI's deal further seals Ive's exile from Apple, which started in 2019, and fully ties him to an emerging competitor.Our thought bubble: Ive famously spent his career at Apple as Steve Jobs' creative partner.OpenAI's video presents the new Ive-Altman pairing as the natural successor to that team — with Sam as the new Steve and Apple left behind as a peddler of \"legacy products.\"What's next: OpenAI said that it will share the first fruits of its new hardware efforts next year, though there's no promise that anything will be shipping that soon.

Sweeney previously told BI's Peter Kafka that his fight with Apple over in-app purchases has cost it more than $1 billion since 2020.Prior to the legal feud, Apple's App Store rules required that Fortnite players — and all other iOS users — make in-app purchases exclusively through the App Store, where Apple takes up to a 30% cut of each transaction. In the summer of 2020, Epic intentionally broke these rules, prompting Apple to remove Fortnite from iPhones and iPads, which in turn sparked Epic's lawsuit.In an email exchange with BI after Fortnite went live on the US App Store, we asked Sweeney if the protracted court battle and legal fees were worth it.\"Yes,\" he said. \"These newly recognized freedoms are priceless.\"\"The freedoms developers have gained in the United States and Europe on iOS must be brought to the rest of the world,\" Sweeney told BI. \"I hold out hope of Apple and Google doing that themselves, proactively, rather than being subject to waiting for different and potentially contradictory new laws to be passed around the world.\"Epic Games is in a similar legal battle with Google over its app store rules.Fortnite is BACK on the App Store in the U.S. on iPhones and iPads... and on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the E.U! It’ll show up in Search soon! Get Fortnite on the App Store in the U.S. ➡️ ",

Apple reportedly plans to introduce tools that will let third-party developers write software using the large language models that power Apple Intelligence. The company is set to announce the software development kit and other resources that will allow this capability on June 9 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. By expanding its AI technology to developers, the company hopes to encourage the creation of new applications that will increase the use of Apple Intelligence and make its products the devices of choice for AI application, according to the report. Apple plans to start this program with the small AI models that run on its devices before expanding it to the larger ones that are cloud-based, per the report. The company announced its rollout of Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI-powered features, in September with the launch of its iPhone 16 lineup, saying it would be gradually released starting in October with iOS 18.1 in the United States. In January, it was reported that Apple disabled AI-generated news summaries on the beta version of iOS 18.3 after earlier updates failed to stop the feature from incorrectly summarizing news articles or simply making up information. Despite this and other problems around AI features, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a January earnings call that the iPhone 16 models performed stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence features were available, showing that the technology drove demand. According to Tuesday’s Bloomberg report, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is also expected to see the launch of new operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac that will be similar to the one used on the Vision Pro headset. It was reported in March that the company was planning to make the biggest changes to its operating systems in years, aiming to make them simpler to navigate and more consistent across its devices. The revamp of the operating systems will reportedly include the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons; simpler ways to navigate and control the devices; and innovations introduced on the Vision Pro.

The company is determined to avoid any scenario in which it appears to attribute price increases to U.S. tariffs on goods from China, where most Apple devices are assembled, the people said. The U.S. and China agreed Monday to suspend most of the tariffs they had imposed on each other in a tit-for-tat trade war. But a 20% tariff that President Trump imposed early in his second term on Chinese goods, citing what he said was Beijing’s role in the fentanyl trade, remains in place and covers smartphones. [...] For Apple’s most profitable, high-end phones, such as the Pro and Pro Max models, Chinese factories will continue to handle the bulk of production, people familiar with Apple’s supply chain said. While Indian factories are capable of producing Pro models, India’s infrastructure and technical capabilities aren’t yet sufficient to support mass production at the scale China can currently deliver, they said. Even if Trump weren’t a vindictive thin-skinned angry kook, I’m sure that if this year’s iPhones have higher prices because of Trump’s tariffs, Apple would not attribute the price increases to the tariffs. At least publicly. But Trump is a vindictive thin-skinned angry kook, irritated even that Apple is shifting some iPhone production to India (which does assemble iPhones already, and has the capability of producing more) instead of the United States (which only has the capability of assembling iPhones, at any sort of scale, in the fever dreams of Trump’s addled mind). So of course no one at Apple is going to blame any price increases — if they do indeed go up — on the tariffs. But come on. If iPhone prices go up in September, everyone who isn’t drunk on MAGA juice is going to blame it on the tariffs. Like, even if Apple had been planning for years to raise prices for the iPhone 17 lineup — if price increases were already baked-in for this year’s models since before Trump was re-elected — now that the tariffs are here, everyone would attribute the price hikes to the tariffs. Especially after the summer of tariff-driven inflation I expect we’re about to go through. ★ Rolfe Winkler and Yang Jie, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal (main link is a gift link, but also here’s a News+ link): Apple is weighing price increases for its fall iPhone lineup, a step it is seeking to couple with new features and design changes, according to people familiar with the matter.

In the mood for a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery? Check out Apple TV's Murderbot, based on Martha Wells' bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries. It stars Alexander Skarsgård as the titular Murderbot, a rogue cyborg security (SEC) unit that gains autonomy and must learn to interact with humans while hiding its new capabilities. (Some minor spoilers below, but no major reveals.) There are seven books in Wells' series thus far. All are narrated by Murderbot, who is technically owned by a megacorporation but manages to hack and override its governor module. Rather than rising up and killing its former masters, Murderbot just goes about performing its security work, relieving the boredom by watching a lot of entertainment media; its favorite is a soap opera called The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Game has been pulled offline in Europe amid legal tussling. After last month's bombshell legal ruling forcing Apple to allow the use of external payment processors for in-app purchases on iOS, Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said Epic Games was \"going to do everything we can to bring Fortnite back to the iOS App Store.\" That \"everything\" now includes a legal motion in the District Court of California seeking to force Apple to \"accept any compliant version of Fortnite onto the US storefront of the App Store.\" Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and terminated Epic's US App Store account in August 2020 after Epic snuck its famous Epic Direct Payments \"hotfix\" into the game (thereby setting off a yearslong legal battle). On May 9, though, Epic used an iOS account for its Swedish subsidiary—which was recently used to take advantage of Europe's DMA policies—to submit a new version of Fortnite to the US App Store. Apple formally rejected that submission on May 15, saying in a letter shared by Epic that it believes the recent court rulings \"do not diminish Apple’s bases and legal right to have terminated Epic Games’ [iOS developer account].\" Even under that new ruling, Apple notes, the 2020 \"hotfix\" allowing Epic Direct Payments inside the app rather than via an external storefront would still violate Apple's current lawful restrictions on such practices.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Epic Games‘ “Fortnite” video game was not available on Apple’s iPhone devices in the European Union and the United States on Friday. Access to Fortnite via Apple’s iPhone Operating System and through its App Store will be unavailable worldwide until Apple unblocks it, Epic Games said. Epic Games did not give a reason why Fortnite was blocked, but Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies. “We did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces,” an Apple spokesperson said. Epic, a U.S.-based studio, backed by China’s Tencent, is the world’s largest game studio. It was launched in 2017 and its last-player-standing, “battle royale” format became an instant hit, drawing millions of players. Since 2020, it has been in a legal battle with Apple, after the gaming firm alleged that Apple’s practice of charging a commission of up to 30% on in-app payments violated U.S. antitrust rules. Late on Friday, Epic Games asked a U.S. judge in California to hold Apple in contempt for blocking the return of “Fortnite” to the App Store in the U.S. In a court filing, Epic said Apple should be required, as part of a prior court ruling to allow the distribution of Fortnite. Apple’s blocking of the app was “blatant retaliation against Epic for challenging Apple’s anticompetitive behavior and exposing its lies to the court,” Epic’s filing added. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing outside regular business hours. Apple banned Fortnite from its store in 2020 but allowed the game back last year following pressure from European Union authorities for Big Tech companies to comply with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. Last year, it also approved Epic Games’ marketplace app on iPhones and iPads in Europe. Epic Games also won a case against Apple earlier this month. —Supantha Mukherjee, Akash Sriram, Mike Scarcella and Gursimran Kaur, Reuters",

Apple and Epic Games are reportedly sparring over Apple’s denial of Epic Games’ resubmission to place its game Fortnite in the App Store. Epic Games said Friday that its resubmission was denied by Apple, while Apple responded that it did not remove the game from alternative distribution marketplaces, CNBC reported Friday (May 16). The Fortnite account said in a post on X: “Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.” The game had been available on iPhones in Europe through Epic Games’ app store, because of the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, but Epic Games said on Friday that it was also blocked from distributing Fortnite there, according to the report. Apple told CNBC later Friday: “We asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.” An April 30 court ruling in a long legal battle brought by Epic Games required Apple to allow third-party payment options within its App Store. While Apple defeated most of the original claims in the 2021 case, the court mandated that it loosen its restrictions and allow developers to direct users to third-party payment methods — and a judge said April 30 that Apple had deliberately circumvented that order. An Apple spokesperson said at the time: “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.” Days later, Apple appealed the judge’s ruling in the case. The company also regulatory battles in Europe tied to the App Store. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said on the day of the court ruling that the company would return Fortnite to the U.S. iOS App Store the following week. In an April 30 post on X, Sweeney said: “Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” The post Apple Disputes Epic Games’ Report of Denial of App Store Submission appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Switch, PS5, and XBox might be the biggest names in video games, but David Lee and a group of entrepreneurial alums from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are carving out a niche market with Nex, a new alternative. The company’s Nex Playground device has sold more than 200,000 units. Instead of buying individual games, families buy a subscription-based collection of 40-plus titles. Like the old Nintendo Wii, Nex focuses on family-friendly, movement-based games. The Nex device plugs into TVs for motion-controlled experiences. Instead of controllers, the device uses a built-in camera that enables you to play games by moving your hands and feet. With national retail expansion underway across 5,000 stores, Nex positions itself as a simpler alternative to pricier, fancier, thumb-based video games. Fast Company spoke with Lee, the founding CEO, about how Nex competes against industry giants and how the company develops distinct hardware and games. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. How do you position Nex in relation to Nintendo and Xbox? We all have a focus on core customers. Nintendo went back to what they were doing—handheld gaming and Mario—their biggest franchises. Xbox users are gamers, people who got an Xbox to play games like Halo. When Microsoft was under pressure from PS4’s lower price, they unbundled Kinect and collapsed that system to compete. We come into this space without any of those existing customers. We decided from the ground up to serve motion gaming. The design of our device, the pricing, how we use one camera to track multiple people, moving sensors into software and AI—it’s all about keeping it affordable with a subscription service that takes care of the whole family. Why did you build a dedicated device after starting with mobile apps? Before we built Nex Playground, we were building motion games on phones. What we discovered is that when we create dedicated hardware instead, we have a much deeper relationship with customers. When there’s a device where the only thing it does is bring the family together to play active games, it shows big potential. When you use your TV for a motion-game experience, you pay much more attention to it than you would to a game on your phone. The experience is a lot better, and customers love it more. How are families using Nex in ways you didn’t expect? When we started searching for customers and building our Facebook community, which now has over 20,000 people, we discovered new use cases. We found that when kids come back from school, we have a half-hour where they just play. On weekends, they play when friends come over. [Photo: Nex] We’ve also found that when kids are at school, parents want fitness experiences for themselves. Even grandparents derive benefits when they have something to do with their body. We’re defining what role we play for different people in the family, delivering benefits at different times of day, different days of the week, even different seasons of the year. In summer when kids are off school, we can occupy them and get them moving and learning. What’s your approach to developing games in a saturated market? We’re focusing on safety, privacy, and security first since we’re serving families. We have our first-party teams building games, but we also work with ten studio deals already, with seven games launched. We bring in partners whose games we like, and we share revenue with them. We want to keep our model simple—we have our subscription model and want to supply and delight users all year. We don’t want to open the system to many games that might be low quality. We’re curating a set of content and working with developers who are passionate about creating great things. Our business model is simple, honest, and sustainable—no ads, no in-app purchases. The moment you open to third parties, they think about different ways to make money. For families, we don’t want to overwhelm them—we just want to serve them really well. How do you keep up with hardware competition? We think about our hardware in a similar way to how Amazon thinks about the Kindle or Apple thinks about the iPad. Every year, we want to do something better to create perfect experiences. For example, we improved the remote control from 2023 to 2024. We learned that the joystick was a little hard for young kids to use—I saw my daughter struggling to press it—so we made it simpler. [Photo: Nex] We’re always looking at what problems people face and how to improve. The hardware cycle is yearly, and we might be able to do something new each year. But we’re not thinking about something dramatically different—we have a pretty good long trajectory ahead. A lot of improvements actually come through software. With the same hardware, you get access to new technology we develop as detection technologies get better. We don’t want to force customers to buy new hardware to play something new. We think about compatibility and how not to fully obsolete customers. This is a device that can serve your family for years to come. Given how much attention is paid to Nintendo’s new Switch, how are people discovering Nex? According to our surveys, roughly 40% of customers hear about us from friends and families. The next-largest segment, about 20%, comes from our online ads. Another 13% first see us in retail stores. Currently, we’re in 700 Target stores, 100 Walmart locations, and 200 Best Buy stores. This year, we have a national retail expansion to over 5,000 stores. Amazon is also now recognizing us as a new gaming system category—if you look at Amazon video games, they put Nex Playground right next to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch as top-level tabs, even though we’re way smaller than any of them. What’s your long-term vision for Nex? We want to keep kids active, bring families together, and even help keep elderly people active so they can stay independent. We want to tie your family together locally and remotely. We’re happy seeing more grandparents buying Nex for their grandkids and then saying “I want one too.”",

        "description": "Cory Joseph has been blind since birth. So he’s among the people Apple aims to serve with an addition to its App Store called “Accessibility Nutrition Labels,” one of a raft of features the company announced earlier this week to mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Once the labels go live later this year, each app’s listing will detail the accessibility features it supports, such as the VoiceOver screen reader, voice input, options to adjust text size and screen contrast, and captioned audio. These enabling technologies can be the difference between an app being essential and unusable: “Having this level of transparency from the App Store is huge,” says Joseph. He isn’t just one of the users who will benefit from that information, though. As a principal accessibility solutions architect at CVS Health, Joseph is in the business of making sure software works for everybody. Given his employer’s scale—it’s the world’s second-largest healthcare company by revenue and reaches 100 million people a day—it’s a job with the potential for deep real-world impact. When using CVS’s apps, “everyone’s trying to find the best care, and we want to make sure that’s barrier-free for everyone,” explains Joseph. The 6-year-old team he’s on has been responsible for achievements that go well beyond taking advantage of the core accessibility features offered by Apple and other platform providers. Spoken Rx uses RFID technology to identify prescription meds and read the vital details about them out loud. [Photo: Courtesy of CVS] In 2020, for instance, the company introduced a CVS Pharmacy app feature called Spoken Rx—“a baby of mine,” Joseph says. Special radio-frequency identification (RFID) labels on prescription containers enable it to read aloud vital information such as dosage instructions. CVS Health has also made some of its investments in accessibility freely available to other developers by open-sourcing them, including iOS and Android code, an automated system for testing website usability, and tools for annotating web designs in Figma. As a field, accessibility has come a long way since Apple first dedicated a team to it, initially known as the Office of Special Education. Over 40 years, the company has built a wealth of functionality into its products to facilitate their use by people with disabilities, including the technologies that make the iPhone useful even if you can’t see its touchscreen interface. Some of its recent advances, such as on-device generation of custom synthetic voices, would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. This week’s announcements even include support for brain-computer interfaces. By contrast, there’s nothing gee-whizzy about the Accessibility Nutrition Labels themselves. They just summarize the features that a given app has enabled. But by doing that in such a straightforward, prominent way, they’ll not only aid millions of users but also give some glory to the software makers who take accessible design seriously. Rather than be embarrassed by listings that make their lack of effort obvious, developers who don’t yet have much to brag about might finally get with the program. Accessibility Nutrition Labels will clearly indicate which features for inclusive design an app supports. [Photo: Apple] Joseph hopes that the labels’ associations are only positive. “It’s easy to think about this sort of thing as a badge of shame, and I think that’s not the right way to think about this,” he told me. “This is an opportunity for independent developers, large organizations, and everyone in between to highlight the good work they do.” Even though Joseph works for a company that has dedicated significant mindshare and money to that good work, he’s up front about the obstacles to rapid progress that large companies face, even when they have all the right intentions. “I would be lying if I said that there aren’t challenges,” he told me. “We’re a gigantic organization. There are challenges in every gigantic organization. Of course, we balance all of our work and plan everything out as best as we can, and we deliver the most successful experience that we can across our applications.” The good news, he adds, is that CVS Health-size resources aren’t necessary to make software accessible. “Realistically, it’s easier for smaller developers,” he says. “They can move more quickly, they can update their code faster, and they can adapt to and take in their user feedback in real time and make those changes by engaging directly. For independent and smaller developers, this shouldn’t be a burden.” I find that take heartening. And if Joseph is right that app creators don’t have to be humongous to get inclusive design right, Accessibility Nutrition Labels will soon prove it.

Speaking in Qatar on the latest leg of his Middle East tour, the US president said he had “a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday” after the Apple chief executive confirmed last week that Indian factories would supply the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the coming months. The Financial Times previously reported that Apple planned to source from India all of the more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US by the end of next year.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "In time, CarPlay Ultra will roll out to other automakers. It's a few years later than we were promised, but an advanced new version of Apple CarPlay is finally here. CarPlay is Apple's way of casting a phone's video and audio to a car's infotainment system, but with CarPlay Ultra it gets a big upgrade. Now, in addition to displaying compatible iPhone apps on the car's center infotainment screen, CarPlay Ultra will also take over the main instrument panel in front of the driver, replacing the OEM-designed dials like the speedometer and tachometer with a number of different Apple designs instead. \"iPhone users love CarPlay and it has changed the way people interact with their vehicles. With CarPlay Ultra, together with automakers we are reimagining the in-car experience and making it even more unified and consistent,\" said Bob Borchers, vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple. Apple has designed various dashboard themes for Aston Martin. Credit: Aston Martin Some are less information-dense than others. Credit: Aston Martin However, to misquote William Gibson, CarPlay Ultra is unevenly distributed. In fact, if you want it today, you're going to have to head over to the nearest Aston Martin dealership. Because to begin with, it's only rolling out in North America with Aston Martin, inside the DBX SUV, as well as the DB12, Vantage, and Vanquish sports cars. It's standard on all new orders, the automaker says, and will be available as a dealer-performed update for existing Aston Martins with the company's in-house 10.25-inch infotainment system in the coming weeks.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "President Donald Trump said he’s asked Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook to stop building plants in India to make devices for the US, pushing the iPhone maker to add domestic production as it pivots away from China. Trump said the US might be getting closer to an agreement with Iran to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program. “I think we’re getting close to maybe doing a deal,” Trump said in Qatar at an event with business leaders on Thursday. Oil fell on Thursday, partly on Trump and Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Shamkhani’s comments. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

That is at least a $360 markdown from Apple's official listing price of 7,999 yuan on its mainland China website.Another 256GB iPhone 16 pro on the same payment plan is selling at 6,220 yuan on JD, down from Apple's official listing price of 8,999 yuan.A 128GB iPhone 16 is selling for around $740 on Tmall.TmallOn Tmall, by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, BI also saw at least one brand new iPhone 16 for 5,299 yuan, also around $230 down from the Apple official listing price of 6,999 yuan.On Apple's US official website, a 128GB iPhone 16 Pro would cost $999, while an iPhone 16 with the same amount of storage is listed at $799.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comments and did not clarify whether these discounts in China are part of an official promotion initiated by Apple.These markdowns follow Apple's struggling sales in China, as cheaper domestic brands gain popularity and shoppers grow thriftier. Apple saw its iPhone shipments down 9% in China in comparison to the first quarter of 2024, and its Q2 sales in China also missed expectations.However, according to a report by the International Data Corporation, smartphone shipments in China grew 3.3% overall in the first quarter, largely due to local Apple rivals like Xiaomi, which saw a 39.9% increase in shipments in China in the same quarter compared to 2024.A Xiaomi 15 Pro, one of its latest models with at least 256GB in storage, is listed for 4,999 yuan on its China website, which is less than $700.Meanwhile, to boost soft consumer spending as China grapples with internal economic issues triggered by a property market crisis, the Chinese government expanded consumer subsidies on smartphones and other tech devices, but only for products priced under 6,000 yuan ($821), leaving many Apple models too expensive to qualify for the discount.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple lost 9% in iPhone shipments in China in Q1 of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.WANG JIAWEI/REUTERSChinese e-commerce sites have reduced the price of Apple's iPhone 16 ahead of a shopping festival.Business Insider found iPhones discounted for hundreds of dollars compared to official listings.Apple faces declining sales in China as local brands like Xiaomi gain market share.Chinese e-commerce websites have slashed some Apple iPhone prices by hundreds of dollars ahead of the 618 shopping festival.The 618 shopping festival, or June 18, typically lasts around two weeks and is the second-largest annual shopping festival in China, which frequently generates more than $100 billion in revenue for its largest e-commerce platforms.On JD, Business Insider found a white iPhone 16 Pro with 128GB of storage on an interest-free 12-month payment plan listed at 5,380 yuan, or around $745.

        "description": "Apple just announced new accessibility features coming to its operating systems. There’s a redesigned braille input experience, and a new reader that allows you to customize your text so it’s more legible. But there’s one that will be great for anyone attending any lecture or presentation: Magnifier for Mac.The iPhone and iPad got their Magnifier apps back in 2016. It worked pretty much like the iOS camera: You point your device anywhere you want and zoom in to the desired level. It also allows you to apply real-time filters to enhance readability depending on your vision’s condition, like turning a book’s black text over white page into white text over blue, as well as changing the image’s contrast and brightness. It also can detect objects around you.The new Mac version takes all that up to an 11 with its new features. To get the view of the world the new Magnifier needs, you will need to use a USB camera or an iPhone. The latter automatically connects to your computer using MacOS’s Continuity Camera feature, allowing you to use your phone as the eyes for your Apple desktop or laptop. Zoom in to focus on something far away, apply the same filters, and adjust the image, just like in iOS and iPadOS.[Image: Apple]A matter of perspectiveWhat makes the update brilliant is the new perspective adjustment. Since you can’t move your Mac around like with Apple’s handheld devices, you need a way to frame the text you want to read correctly.Like Apple’s introductory video shows, you can point your Mac with the attached camera to a whiteboard. Since you are probably not going to be looking at it from a fully perpendicular perspective, the app allows you to draw a polygon by clicking on each corner of the whiteboard in your screen. Then, applying some image deformation magical maths, Magnifier will automatically correct the perspective, turning the skewed whiteboard with deformed text into a perfect flat image that gives you the best view in the class, auditorium, or conference room.From there, you can do whatever you want with that text, including transforming handwriting into a typeface for easier reading. Magnifier uses Apple’s new Accessibility Reader, too, which allows you to customize how a page looks with the colors, fonts, and sizes you prefer—as well as copying and pasting from the whatever text the camera is looking at, regardless of it being handwritten or not. It’s similar to what you can do now with other Apple apps, like Preview, but in one continuous, seamless experience.Bonus points: Magnifier also supports reading any paper-based media using Desk View, the feature that uses your iPhone’s wide-angle lens to capture what’s flat on the table in front of your screen. Just put that novel on the table and transform its small type into something you can read easily (or have your Mac’s text-to-speech abilities to read it for you). It’s easy to imagine every single student, office person, and TED Talk drone using the new Magnifier to get a better experience possible at a presentation—sleeping pills notwithstanding—once it comes out “later this year” (according to Apple). This new little jewel will make your Macbook the best seat in the house no matter where you are sitting.",

        "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook oversaw his company's deep investment in China. That was enormously successful strategy for Apple — but now it's a real problem, argues author Patrick McGee.VCG/VCG via Getty ImagesDonald Trump wants Apple to make iPhones in America.There's no chance that will happen, says Patrick McGee, a journalist who just published a book on Apple's deep ties to China.McGee also argues that Apple's end-around on Trump's China tariffs — saying that some iPhones and other products are made in India and Vietnam — is misleading.You probably know that your iPhone, and just about any other Apple product you own, was made in China. And that Donald Trump wants Apple to move all of that production to the US.But do you know how, and why, Apple ended up so dependent on China — and why that's so unlikely to change?Patrick McGee says he does. He's a journalist who just published \"Apple In China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company\" — a detailed look at all of the money and effort Apple spent over decades to enmesh itself in China.McGee, who has covered Apple for the Financial Times, explains why this has been enormously helpful to Apple — because it created an ecosystem that lets it make ultra-complicated devices at vast scale. But he argues that it was even more helpful to China — because Apple gave Chinese engineers access to valuable technology that has let them build other high-value supply chains.And that McGee posits, has created both a problem for Apple CEO Tim Cook — because he can no longer practically extract the company from China — and for the US — because its adversary is now using American know-how to compete with American companies.(I asked Apple if it wanted to weigh in on McGee's book. Via a rep, the company said that \"claims in the book are untrue\" and \"filled with inaccuracies\" and that McGee didn't fact-check the book with Apple.)I talked to McGee for the newest episode of my Channels podcast. In the edited excerpt below, we talk about why he thinks it's impossible for Apple to move iPhone production to the US. And why McGee thinks that Apple saying it's moving some production to India and Vietnam, in order to escape some US tariffs on China, is deeply misleading.Peter Kafka: The Trump administration says it wants Apple to move all of its manufacturing to the US. You and anyone else who knows anything about Apple saying that is literally not possible when it comes to the iPhone. Why?Patrick McGee: We're lacking so many things. The density of population is one. Lots of people know a factory town [in China] might have 500,000 people just putting together the iPhone. The thing that people don't understand is they're not doing that year-round. They're doing that for three or four months.And then they're moving on to another project. So Apple doesn't bear the cost. It's using the likes of Foxconn to do manufacturing as a service.There's an analyst quoted last month who said it would be like if in the city of Boston, every person dropped what they were doing and just worked on iPhones. And as quotable as that is, that understates the challenge. Because it would like the city of Boston transporting itself to some other place, like Milwaukee, assembling iPhones for a few weeks and then moving on to some other project.China has this floating population — that's literally what it's called — and that workforce alone is greater than America's entire labor force. So we're never going to match them in terms of density of population and, more especially, dynamism of the population.Let alone that it's happening at way lower labor rates. Let alone it's got way better machinery and automation. It's not a matter of willpower and cost — that seems to be what the MAGA dream is based on. It goes so much beyond this.We often say Americans don't want to do these jobs. The Chinese don't want to do these jobs. But there are so many people that would rather be doing that than toiling in the fields for 14 hours a day. We just don't have a base of labor that would do that.One of the other arguments you and others make is that China has people, but there's also just huge infrastructure: a whole series of plants and subplants and subcontractors that all are sort of built around getting Apple the products it needs, at a drop of a hat.Yeah. In the amount of time that it would take China to build a new factory, we would still be doing the environmental paperwork.But in Apple's most recent earnings call, the company said that for the next quarter at least, every iPhone they sell in the US is going to come out of India, and most of the other electronics they sell in the US — AirPods, etc — are going to come out of Vietnam.So what am I missing here? It makes it seem like Apple has gone ahead and figured out how to move this stuff out of China.Not at all. Think of it like this: If there's a thousand steps in making an iPhone and the final one is now in India, you're avoiding tariffs. The final assembly is considered \"making it in India.\"Like if I took every step of baking a cake except for putting the icing on or ...Putting it in the box or something.Honestly, not much is happening in India. That might change in the next five to 10 years, but the idea that there is actual production happening in India is just wrong.If you buy an iPhone next year, it'll say \"made in India.\" I think that's a near-certainty. But that phone will be no less dependent on the China-centric supply chain than any other iPhone you've ever purchased.On that earnings call, Apple also said that the existing tariffs will cost them $900 million in the next quarter. That may sound like a big number, but Apple makes $100 billion in profit a year, so it's not. If that was just the only impact from the tariffs, that seems like a pretty solvable problem for Apple: They have to move final assembly to India, and eat some costs, but they could do it.Yeah, absolutely.Where I think things are much dicier is that the political ties that Apple has with China are unbreakable. I shouldn't say political ties — I really mean the business ties. They are not going to leave China anytime soon.Yet the technological transfer that is engendered by designing cutting-edge products every year and building them in China inherently causes a technology transfer from America to China on a crazy level. And if you think of China as a threat, if you think of them as America's biggest adversary, it is insane that the world's greatest company is equipping China with this technological know-how year in, year out.The Wall Street Journal just reported that Apple is thinking about maybe tacking on some of these additional costs to the next round of iPhones they start selling this fall — passing those costs on to the consumer. Does that sound right to you?Yes, because the other alternative is that you're squeezing out more from your suppliers. Some analysts have suggested that, and it's kind of laughable. Because if there's anything to squeeze out of the supply chain, you damn well better know that Apple's already done it. Apple pays its suppliers very slim margins. There are not a bunch of fat cats out there that they can just be squeezingRead the original article on Business Insider Apple CEO Tim Cook oversaw his company's deep investment in China. That was enormously successful strategy for Apple — but now it's a real problem, argues author Patrick McGee.VCG/VCG via Getty ImagesDonald Trump wants Apple to make iPhones in America.There's no chance that will happen, says Patrick McGee, a journalist who just published a book on Apple's deep ties to China.McGee also argues that Apple's end-around on Trump's China tariffs — saying that some iPhones and other products are made in India and Vietnam — is misleading.You probably know that your iPhone, and just about any other Apple product you own, was made in China. And that Donald Trump wants Apple to move all of that production to the US.But do you know how, and why, Apple ended up so dependent on China — and why that's so unlikely to change?Patrick McGee says he does. He's a journalist who just published \"Apple In China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company\" — a detailed look at all of the money and effort Apple spent over decades to enmesh itself in China.McGee, who has covered Apple for the Financial Times, explains why this has been enormously helpful to Apple — because it created an ecosystem that lets it make ultra-complicated devices at vast scale.

        "description": "Apple is working on a new accessibility idea that uses brain signals to control its devices, as reported by The WSJ. The project connects medical implants with digital interfaces, aiming to help users with serious movement problems. One goal is to give full device access without any hand or voice input.The system involves brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs. One company, Synchron, has built a small device that gets inserted into a brain-related vein. It listens to neural activity and sends signals to connected systems. Apple is learning how to use this data to control iPhones, iPads, Macs, and the Vision Pro headset.So far, a few patients have tested the technology. One of them has a condition that prevents him from walking or speaking. Still, with the device inside his body and an Apple headset on, he can explore virtual places and select apps by thinking. The setup connects thoughts to digital actions.The method isn’t perfect yet. Some features like pointer movement or drag-and-drop gestures are missing. The pace is slow. But it works, and Apple is building tools to support it better in future updates.Later this year, Apple will roll out new software versions—iOS 19 and visionOS 3. These versions will have new support systems for BCI users. A setting called Switch Control will allow users to do more using brain signals only. No hand movement will be required.Apple is also changing how users create a synthetic voice that sounds like their own. Last year, the process required many spoken sentences and hours of training. With iOS 19, people will need to record only ten short phrases. The result is processed in one minute. The final voice sounds smoother and closer to natural speech.These steps show how Apple is designing accessibility tools that may one day become standard features. The company is building for people who can’t move or speak, but the impact could go further.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Android 16 Brings Major Security Upgrades and Smarter Anti-Theft Features",

        "description": "Apple is partnering with brain-computer interface company Synchron to develop technology that lets users control devices using neural signals. Still in the early stages, the technology could significantly expand accessibility for users who are unable to operate devices with their hands, Synchron said in a press release. The partnership was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “This marks a defining moment for human-device interaction,” Synchron CEO Tom Oxley said in a statement. “Apple is helping to pioneer a new interface paradigm, where brain signals are formally recognized alongside touch, voice and typing.” Historically, users have interacted with tech devices through keyboards, mice, and more recently, touch and voice. But these interfaces remain limiting for people with certain impairments. Apple and Synchron are now working to translate specific brain signals into actions like selecting icons on a screen. Synchron’s implantable device, called the Stentrode, uses electrodes to read brain activity. It integrates with Apple’s “Switch Control” feature, which allows users to operate devices via alternative input methods. “When we ask our clinical trial participants what they want to do, it’s always about communication and creativity,” Synchron chief commercial officer Kurt Haggstrom said in a statement. “And to most people, that means using their Apple devices. For Apple to recognize that need, and respond to it, demonstrates how much they value accessibility for their users.” The technology likely remains years away from FDA approval and widespread use. Synchron said limited trials with patients are expected to begin later this year.",

        "description": "You can learn a lot about an app before you download it from Apple’s App Store, such as what other users think of it, the access it has to your personal data, and how much storage it occupies. Starting soon, listings will also include a section on something critically important to millions of people: the accessibility features an app supports. Designed to help users with disabilities make more informed decisions about which apps to try, these new “nutrition labels” are part of a bevy of announcements Apple is making to mark this Thursday’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day. The company says they’ll all be available later this year. The new accessibility-details feature, which really is called “Accessibility Nutrition Labels,” lets developers indicate support for existing Apple features such as VoiceOver, Voice Control, Larger Text, Sufficient Contrast, Reduced Motion, and captions. Some app providers already cover this ground in their app descriptions; third-party resources such as AppleVis are also valuable. But for the first time, Apple is providing a dedicated, consistent spot for accessibility information. Users will know where to look for it. Developers who enable these features will get credit for their efforts. And with any luck, many more companies will be incentivized to make their products as accessible as possible. Accessibility Reader offers multiple ways to reformat text for improved legibility. [Image: Courtesy of Apple] Apple is also spotlighting a new Mac version of Magnifier, a feature for making real-world text and other elements easier to see. (It’s existed on the iPhone and iPad since 2016.) The Mac version works with USB cameras or an iPhone’s camera to enlarge text, adjust its perspective and contrast, and otherwise help people with impaired vision read more quickly and easily. It can handle multiple sources at once—for instance, capturing writing on a classroom whiteboard while simultaneously scanning in pages from a book. It also works with a new feature called Accessibility Reader that reformats textual material to be more legible and is embedded in Apple’s operating systems, so it’s available in any app. Other new items the company is previewing for Global Accessibility Awareness Day cover all of its platforms. For example, Braille Access is a feature for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro that lets braille users take notes and perform calculations, either with the Apple device alone or with specialized braille input hardware. (Apple supports more than 70 such products.) A feature called Live Listen allows an iPhone to be used as a remote microphone and displays captions in real time on an Apple Watch. Eye tracking, an existing input option on iPhones and iPads, is being upgraded for easier typing. Vision Pro is adding new features for magnification and spoken descriptions of environments, plus software hooks to let accessibility apps such as Be My Eyes get access to its main camera. Even CarPlay is getting some updates, including the ability to alert deaf and hard-of-hearing users to sounds such as a baby’s crying, sirens, and honking cars. Live Listen’s features include real-time captioning via Apple Watch. [Image: Courtesy of Apple] Yet another Apple announcement involves Personal Voice, a 2-year-old feature that lets people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) use an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to create a digitized version of their voice for later use after the progressive disease has made speaking difficult or impossible. When I wrote about the original version of this feature in 2023, the fact that a user needed to spend only 15 minutes recording phrases and wait a few hours for the device to generate the digital voice was an impressive advance over previous technologies for voice banking. Apple says the new version requires only 10 phrases and less than a minute of on-device computation to generate a voice. In a brief demo the company gave me, the results sounded significantly more natural than those from the first version. Knock Apple for being “behind in AI” if you please—but Personal Voice is one potentially life-changing area where it seems to be making a giant leap forward.",

        "description": "Apple appears to be lining up a targeted fix for one of iPhone’s most persistent headaches i.e.: unreliable battery endurance. Sources familiar with internal progress hint that the company is preparing a fully adaptive power management feature, set to debut with iOS 19 during June’s developer showcase.The upcoming mechanism, which reportedly draws intelligence from user behavior directly on the device, aims to stretch battery mileage without hindering daily performance. Instead of enforcing static power profiles, the new system would quietly track personal habits — when you stream, game, idle, or charge — and make microscopic decisions accordingly. Resource-heavy actions may pause when power runs low. Other tasks might wait until plugged in.Apple already provides battery-preserving options like charging delay settings and background throttling, but those tools treat all users similarly. The new approach, if finalized, leans on machine learning to adapt in real-time, reshaping how the phone operates based on one’s daily rhythm.No public confirmation has emerged from Cupertino yet, and product strategies often evolve behind closed doors. Even within testing labs, not all prototypes pass through to final release.Nonetheless, Apple’s deeper shift toward AI in power control marks a meaningful twist. With this year’s software cycle likely to be flooded with artificial intelligence integrations, a smarter battery could serve as a quiet but vital part of the overhaul. WWDC in June may pull back the curtain.

The news came just as […] The post Apple Reportedly Mulling Price Hike for Fall iPhone Releases appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple is reportedly considering price increases for its next iPhone models. However, the tech giant is committed to avoiding the appearance of blaming that price hike on U.S. tariffs on products from China, where most iPhones are made, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (May 12), citing sources familiar with the matter. The news came just as the U.S. and China announced a deal to suspend most of the tariffs they had placed on each other. Still, a 20% tariff that President Donald Trump imposed earlier this year on Chinese goods is still in place and applies to smartphones. As the report notes, the trade conflict between the U.S. and China has placed pressure on Apple’s supply chain, leading the company to look to India to handle smartphone manufacturing. However, sources told the WSJ that the most profitable, high-end iPhone models will continue to primarily be made in China, as India’s infrastructure and technical capabilities can’t yet support mass production at the scale China can offer. Of the 65 million or so iPhones sold in the U.S. last year, 36 to 39 million were the higher-end Pro or Pro Max models, the WSJ added, citing estimates from the investment bank Jefferies. PYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. Sources told the WSJ Apple would struggle offsetting tariff costs just by seeking savings from suppliers. That means it would likely see a hit to its profit margins unless it raised prices. But company officials are reluctant to blame tariffs for rising prices. As the WSJ notes, when Amazon appeared to be doing the same thing last month by listing the tariff-related cost of goods on its website, the White House lashed out. The tech giant quickly said this plan “was never approved and is not going to happen.” Not all businesses are as reluctant to blame the tariffs for their troubles. Close to 20% of American small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are pessimistic about their chances of remaining afloat over the next five years, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Brewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs.” “For SMBs, tariffs aren’t just a line item; they’re an existential threat,” PYMNTS wrote last month. “Prices for goods and services climbed to their steepest rate in over a year this month, with tariffs fueling an especially sharp increase in prices of manufactured goods.” SMBs account for around one-third of total imports to the U.S., that report added, but don’t have the advantages of bigger firms, like the ability to diversify suppliers or negotiate bulk contracts.

A new technical paper titled “EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks” was published by researchers at Northeastern University. Abstract “Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim’s activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple’s M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.” Find the technical paper here.

Investors in Apple and Google are reportedly uneasy about the growing popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) search. That’s according to a report Saturday (May 10) by Seeking Alpha, which said that Google’s shares fell 8% last week when an Apple executive said that searches originating from Google’s search engine in Apple’s Safari browser fell for the first time last month. That executive, Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue, revealed that milestone while giving testimony in a Justice Department lawsuit against Google. He attributed the decreased searches to the increasing popularity of AI-based search offerings like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Cue also said Apple is considering adding AI search engines like Perplexity to Safari, where Google now dominates thanks to an ongoing revenue-sharing partnership with Apple. The report noted that a pivot to AI will impact both Google and Apple, as that revenue-sharing agreement generated $20 billion for the latter company in 2022. Google lost close to $150 billion in market capitalization following Cue’s testimony, while Apple’s shares dropped around 1%. The report also included comments from analysts who argued the rise of AI-powered search poses a threat to both companies. “Although some smartphone users may not regard AI features as very important, the times are changing, and Apple has to cater to the growing demand for consumer AI features,” analyst Dilantha De Silva said. And analyst Nexus Research contended that Cue’s statements on Google show the company’s main business is in danger. “While Google is also in talks with Apple to integrate its Gemini assistant with Siri, Alphabet is unlikely to enjoy the “default” status that it has enjoyed for many years with Google Search on iPhones, given that Apple is also in talks with other AI rivals like Perplexity,” Nexus said. Meanwhile, OpenAI is making a play for the consumer market by recruiting Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to run its applications business, PYMNTS wrote last week, arguing this signifies that the company is “more than just an AI model builder.” “OpenAI clearly wants to own the consumer platform,” Julia Huang, founding partner at Vesey Ventures, told PYMNTS. “They have a great shot at doing it and Fidji’s experience at Instacart in bringing together merchants and consumers would be really valuable.” Huang added, “The challenge to Google is clear already in search,” since people have been moving to AI chatbots for searches. “I think this will be a play to close the loop around the whole transaction.” The post Apple and Google Investors Fret as ChatGPT Gains Search Ground appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "For well over a decade now, consumers have been used to new iPhones coming out in the fall, like clockwork. However, according to a series of reports, Apple may be planning to change its iPhone release schedule drastically. The change could significantly impact when you can buy your next preferred model of the iPhone. It could also provide Apple with several key advantages in an increasingly competitive smartphone landscape. A staggered iPhone release Apple released the original iPhone on June 29, 2007. For the following three years, Apple released a new iPhone every June or July. But in 2011, Apple altered its iPhone release window, shifting to a fall launch date for the iPhone 4s. Since that date, Apple’s new family of latest and greatest iPhones has launched every fall, with the exception of the iPhone SE (which was historically not considered part of the latest iPhone family) and this year’s iPhone SE replacement, the iPhone 16e. Yet, according to two reports this week—one from The Information and one from respected TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo—2025 is the last year that Apple will launch an entirely new iPhone family of entry-level and premium phones in unison in the fall. Instead, beginning in 2026, Apple will move to a biannual iPhone release schedule, which will see the pricier “premium” iPhone models launch in the fall, and the cheaper “entry-level” and “budget” iPhone models in the first half of the following year. You can still expect to see Apple launch the new iPhone 17 family in full this fall: most likely the entry-level iPhone 17 and the premium iPhone 17 Slim/Air (the exact name of the new, thin iPhone is uncertain at this point), iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. But this will be the last year Apple releases entry-level and premium family members at the same time. (The budget iPhone 17e is expected to debut in Spring 2026 as is usual for the budget model). Starting in 2026, though, things will change. Apple will launch the premium iPhone 18 series models, including the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone 18 Slim/Air, along with a new foldable iPhone 18 in the fall. However, the entry-level iPhone 18 and budget iPhone 18e won’t be released until approximately six months later, in the spring of 2027. This new staggered release schedule is sure to irritate some consumers, particularly those who enjoy buying the entry-level new iPhone model every September. However, the change will benefit Apple in several ways. Chinese competition The Information was the first to report on Apple’s planned release schedule changes, followed a few days later by a report from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo suggested that one of the main reasons Apple was shaking up the iPhone schedule was to give the company an advantage in China, which is Apple’s second-largest market after the U.S. According to Kuo, Apple is facing intense competition in China, and since many smartphone manufacturers now release phones in China in the first half of the year, this leaves Apple at a disadvantage. Traditionally, when competitors launch their new phones in the first half of the year, Apple is selling a phone that is already six months old. That’s not great optics from a marketing perspective. By moving the iPhone’s entry-level and budget “e” versions launch to the first half of the year, Apple can market new phones while its competitors are doing the same. This benefits Apple not only in China but also around the world. Springtime has historically been one of Apple’s slower sales periods because the company does not usually have a major new flagship iPhone product launch at that time. However, by launching the entry-level version of the latest flagship iPhone series in the spring, Apple can boost its sales during this period. Compelling consumers to buy pricier models Having a fresh new flagship phone on the market isn’t the only advantage Apple can gain from staggering its newest iPhone family launch across two different points during the year. The strategy may also encourage consumers who desire the latest iPhone to upgrade to the premium model instead of waiting another six months for the entry-level model to be released. For example, someone who really wants a new iPhone 18 in 2026 will need to opt to purchase one of the premium iPhone 18 models, which is expected to include the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, iPhone 18 Slim/Air, and foldable iPhone 18. They won’t have the option to buy the cheaper iPhone 18 or iPhone 18e until around six months later, in 2027. Delaying the less expensive models by six months may compel some consumers to opt for the pricier premium ones instead, ultimately benefiting Apple’s bottom line. Easing manufacturing bottlenecks Finally, Apple could also benefit from a manufacturing perspective if it shifts to a biannual iPhone release schedule, as The Information pointed out (via MacRumors). Currently, Apple’s manufacturing partners around the world—but primarily in China—must bring on tens of thousands of workers every summer to assemble iPhones for the fall launch. Bottlenecks can easily occur in the manufacturing chain if enough workers aren’t available. However, if Apple staggers its iPhone rollout throughout the year, Chinese manufacturers may not need to staff up at the levels traditionally required. As a result, it is less likely that labor shortages will impact iPhone launch dates and availability. This may help Apple mitigate some manufacturing risk, which could otherwise delay product launches and thus hurt sales. 2025: The last year for a unified iPhone family launch? Of course, it should be noted that Apple hasn’t confirmed plans to transition to a biannual iPhone release schedule in 2026—and the company will likely not announce anything until it unveils the new premium models that fall. Still, the move does make a lot of sense for the company from both a marketing and financial perspective. Given that The Information and Kuo both have good track records when it comes to reporting on Apple’s supply chain plans, the change seems more likely than not. What that means for consumers is that 2025 is probably the last year that Apple will launch the full family of the newest iPhones simultaneously, marking the end of an era of sorts for the iPhone.",

        "description": "Linus Torvalds sees \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on them. Intel's i486 was the first \"computer number\" I ever really understood. Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16–100 MHz) and \"DX\" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it. More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years after Intel stopped making them, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar, quoting Linus Torvalds regarding \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (Time Stamp Counter) and CX8 (i.e., \"fixed\" CMPXCH8B, its own whole thing), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors). It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. \"We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022,\" Torvalds wrote in October 2022. Failing major changes to the 6.15 kernel, which will likely arrive late this month, i486 support will be dropped.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Apple could owe you part of a class action lawsuit settlement centered around the company’s voice assistant, Siri. The settlement was reached in January, and Apple agreed to set aside $95 million to pay people who allegedly had their conversations or queries recorded after unintentionally activating Siri. Here’s what you need to know about the settlement, key dates, and how to determine whether you can participate in the $95 million payout. What is the settlement about? Back in 2014, Apple added a “Hey, Siri” hotword command that, when spoken, automatically triggers Siri on a compatible Apple device to listen to what is being said. The feature was meant to be useful to users by allowing them to trigger the voice assistant without having to physically press or tap a button. But sometimes people could trigger Siri using the “Hey, Siri” voice command unintentionally or accidentally. The lawsuit alleged that the resulting words or conversations Siri picked up after these unintended activations were then shared with third parties or advertisers—and thus had their privacy violated. As with nearly every class action lawsuit that it settled, Apple denied any wrongdoing. As the iPhone maker told Fast Company in January, “Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.” Now, users who are included in the settlement can begin filing claims for their share of the $95 million. Who is included in the Siri settlement? Not everyone who owns an Apple device is included in the settlement. In order to be part of the settlement class, you must meet several requirements, according to the official settlement website. Those include: You must have owned or purchased a Siri-enabled iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, iMac, HomePod, iPod touch, or Apple TV. Those devices must have been owned or purchased between September 17, 2014 and December 31, 2024. You must reside in the United States and/or its territories. Your “confidential or private communications” must have been “obtained by Apple and/or were shared with third parties as a result of an unintended Siri activation.” How do I know if I am included in the settlement? People who are known to be included in the settlement will have received an email or postal communication saying they have been identified as a settlement member. However, if you have not received such communication but still believe that you may be a settlement member, you can contact the settlement administrator. How much can I get from the settlement? The amount you received from the $95 million settlement depends on various factors. Apple agreed to pay out $95 million to settle the class action suit, but some of that $95 million will go to pay for things like attorneys’ fees and other costs. Whatever is left over will be distributed to the settlement members on a pro rata basis. Claimants are allowed to submit claims for up to five devices. Payments per device will be capped at $20 each. That means that a claimant is most likely to receive no more than $100. However, note that the settlement website says that payment amounts could increase or decrease depending on the number of claims filed. The final payment amount per device will not be known until all claims are submitted. What should I do if I am part of the settlement? If you are part of the settlement, you should file a claim using the claim form on the settlement website. Keep in mind that you only have until July 2, 2025, to file a claim. Any claims are expected to be paid after the final court hearing in August 2025. Full details of the class action settlement can be found on the settlement website here.",

But he's taking a different approach now.In a fireside chat with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison this week, Ive, who has been busy working on an independent design agency called LoveFrom since leaving Apple in 2019, acknowledged that his more recent work can be seen as \"Jony's ornament era.\"\"I think that's a lovely observation,\" Ive said in response to Collison, who described his work at Apple as \"so stripped down\" and \"reduced to the essence.\"Ive's ideas and work at Apple were often inspired by Dieter Rams, the German industrial designer who had a \"less but better\" approach that informed his work at consumer products businesses like Braun. In the fireside chat, Ive said that his work at LoveFrom is informed by a diverse team of industrial, graphic, and sound designers, as well as architects, typographers, and musicians, as opposed to at Apple, where his team had \"clear criteria for what we were doing.\"Ive has shared few details about the projects LoveFrom is working on, with his design agency's website maintaining a barebones display that has shrouded the storied designer's future work in secrecy.A logo for King Charles III's coronation.Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesBut a few public projects have indicated a shift in direction in his design, with Ive notably creating an ornament logo for the coronation of King Charles III, as well as work for Airbnb.\"If you're working for the King on his coronation identity, that of course, would demand a very different approach than the one we would have taken if we were designing instructional products for how to use an iMac,\" Ive said.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Apple is certainly on a roll. The company managed to hit a revenue milestone from its US App Store commissions that went over $10 billion in 2024.The latest stats come to us thanks to Appfigures, who claim the figure nearly doubled from 2020 to 2024. Appfigures’ statistics also shows that, developers managed to produce $33 billion in gross revenue from platforms and games through Apple’s payments last year. After giving Apple’s share, that left them with $23 billion.While the tech giant does not break down its earnings during financial reports, it did share how the App Store was doing great globally, with over $104 billion produced via estimated billings for digital products and services.

But as per these stats, there is a discrepancy between what the iPhone maker is reporting and what Appfigures estimated analysis mentions.This is usually shared through important caveats seen in the report. You can find it under the billings and sales figures tab, and they’re not the same as App Store Billings, which is important here.When the tech giant wrote out this report, the firm shared how it was working hard to display how large the store is and how relevant it is for Apple’s success and the general economy. This is why it combined revenue from the App Store with that produced outside it to give a grand total of the Billings and Sales domain.In this report, Apple shared how the portion of the total revenue is produced by the App Store, even if a purchase was made elsewhere. For example, when users buy subscriptions for a streaming service, but spend 60% of their time watching it through an Apple device, the Cupertino firm takes the credit. When we examine the figures related to the App Store in the US, revenue is more important here, thanks to the court ruling on how Apple takes a step back from charging 27% commission regarding transactions that occur beyond the App Store. Apple says it tried to comply with the court’s ruling related to Fortnite maker Epic Games by introducing changes that would not harm its App Store profits. For this, Apple kept on charging a commission of nearly 27% on such purchases and ruled out how a website link might appear. Last week, we saw a judge share that Apple violated the 2021 injunction by continually collecting fees on any purchase done external to its app store. It also gave rise to more barriers that would restrict competition. Such a legal decision forced the tech giant with no option but to make changes to the rules in the App Store. This means it would give developers the chance to add links to other means by which consumers can make a purchase. Since then, several platforms have taken advantage of the chance to introduce payments on the web. Now this would impact Amazon Kindle, Spotify, and Patreon. Another game emulator dubbed Delta is also showing support from memberships of Patreon memberships. Obviously, the iPhone maker is not happy with the court’s ruling and has decided to appeal it in its recent filing, adding more details about how it causes serious harm. Such imitations could cost the firm huge sums of money every year. Therefore, it sees it as a punishment, more than anything else.

        "description": "Google issued a brief statement on Wednesday following courtroom remarks from Apple that caused a sharp market reaction.During an antitrust hearing, Apple executive Eddy Cue said search use inside Safari declined last month. He described the drop as a shift in how people access information.That comment drove Alphabet shares down more than 7 percent by the end of the day.Some in the tech world have echoed similar views. On a recent episode of a Y Combinator program, one host said web traffic from Google dropped 15 percent. He believed the change came from users switching to newer applications that give direct answers.He said people around him now rely more on ChatGPT and other tools to find what they need. In his view, Google feels less current and more like an older site that serves narrow tasks.Google, in a short press release, said overall searches continue to rise. The company also noted that queries from Apple devices increased.Google added that people now access search through apps, voice input, and camera use. No other details were included in the statement.The company said it plans to show further developments at its I/O event.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: AI’s Data Growth Drains Water Supplies, as 70% More Centers Emerge",

        "description": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Gonzalo Fuentes/REUTERSGoogle stock tumbled after Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue said Safari searches had dropped.A filing reveals another reason Google watchers worry about search: slowed growth in paid clicks.Some analysts are split over whether Google's Search empire is under threat.Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue set alarm bells ringing on Wednesday after dropping a bombshell at Google's antitrust trial: Google searches through Safari dropped in April for the first time ever.While his comments triggered a frenzied sell-off in Google stock, it might not be the only reason the company's watchers should be concerned about Google's ability to keep full control over the search market.A little-noticed number in Google's latest financial disclosure may be the realest sign yet that investors have reason to worry.After reporting blockbuster Q1 earnings last month, Google revealed in a 10-Q filing with the SEC that paid clicks for the quarter grew 2%, down from 5% growth in the same quarter a year ago. That's the slowest growth rate since the company began reporting the metric.Paid clicks are exactly what they sound like: people click on ads across Google Search and other services such as Google Play and Gmail. Each click translates to money in Google's pocket.Why those paid clicks are down, exactly, Google hasn't said.\"It's possible macro played a role, or searches with AI overviews delivered better results, requiring fewer 'paid clicks' to get to conversion,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note published Wednesday. \"But mostly, it's a worrying KPI.\"The analysts said they believe the timing of the dip, combined with Cue's comments and surging numbers of ChatGPT and Meta AI users, suggests that Google's control of the search market may be lower than previously believed.\"Combined, we estimate Google's search share is closer to 65-70% vs. the 90% we often hear,\" they wrote.Google declined to comment.Google's slice of pieGoogle insists that it's seeing more searches than ever.Since the 2000s, the company has managed to harvest vast amounts of searches by paying Apple a fee to make its search engine the default on Apple's Safari web browser. As recently as 2022, Google had paid Apple at least $20 billion — a massive fee that signals how much value Google sees in having Apple users turn to its search engine for all their queries.It maintains that this partnership continues to drive growth in searches. Cue's comments were provocative enough to prompt the search giant to issue a public statement stating that it continues to see \"overall query growth\" in Search, including an increase in total queries coming from Apple.There's little doubt among industry watchers that the overall search pie is growing — though figures from research firm Statcounter suggest Google's control of the global search has fallen slightly. The big question is whether Google's slice of that pie is shrinking relative to rivals.According to Statcounter, Google's share of global search traffic fell to 89.71% in March 2025, down from about 91% in March 2024 and about 93% in March 2023.Meanwhile, competing search products are growing. In April, OpenAI said that around 10% of the world uses ChatGPT, which would be at least 800 million users. Meta also said that about 1 billion people use AI across its various products.The search market expands with AI as chatbots and generative tools expand the definition of search. Google could reap the rewards here, though this also creates an opening for competitors charging as fast as possible to stay ahead of the search giant.Bernstein analysts estimated that generative AI queries that run through chatbots such as ChatGPT are reaching volumes close to 15% of the queries processed by Google and other traditional search engines.Analysts are splitOther analysts are divided on just how much of a threat Google's search business faces.For instance, longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo took to X on Wednesday to explain why he felt it was a mistake to think generative AI would not affect Google's advertising business.He said that despite the \"continued growth of Google's advertising business,\" the company hasn't had much competition yet.\"GenAI service providers have not launched advertising businesses, so Google Ads remains the best choice for online advertisers,\" Kuo wrote.The following statement by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, implies that Google search and advertising business are facing potential threats from generative AI (GenAI):Cue noted that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month, which he attributed…— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) May 7, 2025 Kuo likened Google's situation to the one Yahoo faced during the 2000s. The company's advertising business, launched in 1995, only started declining in 2008, despite newfound competition from Google's AdWords business arriving back in 2000.Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have a different view. In a research note on Wednesday, the analysts had a particular word to describe the roughly $155 billion sell-off in Google's stock following Cue's comments: \"overblown.\"While they acknowledged that Google's AI-powered \"Overviews\" feature may act as a headwind right now as it is resulting in \"fewer searches,\" they said Google will \"be able to ramp monetization\" of its AI summary feature over the long run.They also don't see a scenario where Apple shifts away from Google and causes as much harm as investors might think.\"While Safari is significant, it does not represent the entirety of search activity; iOS accounts for 18% of operating systems, and Safari holds 17% of the browser market share compared to Chrome's 66%,\" the analysts wrote.Have something to share?

The stakes are very high.Is Google screwed?That's the $2 trillion question the tech world is trying to understand, following yesterday's blockbuster news: A top Apple executive said search queries on Google's Safari browser were declining because people were using AI engines like ChatGPT instead.Investors immediately acted as if Google's astonishing run at the top of the tech heap was over, and slashed the company's stock by more than 8%.But a day later, Google's stock is climbing back up a bit, and there's a healthy debate about what Cue's statement means — as well as why he said it.Spoiler: I'm not going to solve this one today. But let's at least look at the argument.The most obvious way to view Cue's comments was the way Wall Street did: That Google search dominance was being eroded by AI competitors.After all, fear of being usurped by AI is what pushed Google to fast-track its own AI efforts, even when some of those efforts created embarrassing results.But later on Wednesday, Google put out a statement that basically said Cue was wrong, without actually saying that out loud. Instead, the company said it was continuing to see increasing searches, and \"that includes an increase in total queries coming from Apple's devices and platforms.\"So that looks like two of the world's most powerful and valuable companies are disagreeing over basic, knowable facts.But people who pay attention to this stuff are focusing on three key words in Google's statement: \"total,\" \"devices,\" and \"platforms.\" And the absence of another word: \"Safari.\"And that's leading them to translate Google's statement this way: \"Maybe Apple really is seeing fewer searches on Safari, the default web browser on iPhones. But you can use Google in other ways on iPhones — namely, via the Google app, but also via Google's own Chrome browser. And people are using those more — enough to counter any decline elsewhere.\"Assuming that this translation is accurate, that should reassure Google and its boosters a bit, though not completely: Cue said the searches on Safari were down for the first time ever, and that's not the kind of signal you can just wave away.And even if Google Safari searchers are really moving to things like the Google App instead, that also underlines the fact that people who used to just type something into their iPhone browser know now they can get results other ways. And there's no reason they couldn't also be searching Google competitors like ChatGPT.A Google rep declined to comment; Apple hasn't responded to my request for comment.Google investors, by the way, don't seem 100% convinced by Google's statement: The stock is up 3% on Thursday, which means Google is still worth 5% less than it was Wednesday morning, when Cue started testifying in the US vs. Google antitrust trial.Which brings us to the second question Google and Apple watchers are speculating about: Why did Cue say what he said in court, after all?I'm an Occam's Razor guy, so my first take was that Cue answered the questions he was asked in court.But there's also a 4D chess argument, put forth by folks like MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson. It goes like this: Cue has an incentive to portray Google as a wounded animal.That's because Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine on Safari (that's the reason Cue has insight into Google's search activity), and a federal judge has already declared that Google has an illegal monopoly in search.And one of the remedies the judge could push for would be to prevent Google from paying Apple for that valuable real estate — which would mean Apple could lose all of that high-margin revenue.So, the theory goes, convincing the judge that Apple no longer has a stranglehold on search, because of AI competition, might allow those payments to keep flowing after all.That theory also helps explain Google's muted response on Wednesday night, where the company tried to walk the line between tooting its own horn (which bucks up investors but could damage its legal argument) and acknowledging that they have real competition (which could help Google in court but hurt it in the market).Which brings us back to where we started: Is Google really starting to lose out to the ChatGPTs of the world, and entering a permanent decline, just like pay TV networks a decade ago? Or is it holding its own despite the competition?

Think Apple and Microsoft, Coke and Pepsi, McDonald’s and Burger King and many other famous pairings. It’s because a dose of healthy competition ultimately benefits the end consumer, and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the ongoing battle between retail titans Walmart and Amazon. The two mega retailers have evolved far beyond price wars and delivery speed, although those twin pillars remain key goals, and competition today plays out across artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, and omnichannel ecosystems. It can frequently result in new strategies that have the potential to redefine the very fabric of commerce. Robotics Come to Life for Retail Operations Amazon continues to push the boundaries of robotic technology with the introduction on Wednesday (May 7) of Vulcan, a fulfillment center robot and Amazon’s first robot equipped with a sense of touch. It can handle approximately 75% of warehouse items, including those that are oddly shaped or fragile, and operates up to 20-hour shifts, assisting human workers by managing tasks that involve reaching high or low shelves, thereby reducing physical strain on employees. The announcement followed reports from February that Amazon aims to glean savings from its robotics efforts as it increases spending on AI. Amazon has deployed over 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers, including autonomous mobile robots like Proteus and robotic arms such as Robin and Cardinal. These systems are integrated with AI to enhance efficiency and safety in operations And while Amazon is launching robots that can feel, Walmart is turning to machines that can build. In a literally groundbreaking move, Walmart partnered with Alquist 3D to construct a 5,000-square-foot warehouse extension in Huntsville, Alabama, using robotic 3D printing technology. Completed in just seven days with a five-person crew, the project underscores the commitment of large retailers to leveraging automation to address labor shortages and accelerate construction timelines. Retail Footprints Still Matter Both companies are building for the future. In the U.S., Walmart has unveiled its first new Supercenter in Cypress, Texas, after a four-year hiatus — a 170,000-square-foot “Store of the Future” that blends physical retail with digital innovation. This flagship location is part of a broader plan to build or convert over 150 stores and remodel 650 more, integrating features like expanded departments, private pharmacy screening rooms, and enhanced online pickup and delivery services. Also in the U.S, Walmart is reinforcing its dedication to American manufacturing through initiatives like the “Grow with US” program, designed to assist small businesses in navigating the complexities of retail. These efforts align with Walmart’s pledge to invest an additional $350 billion in U.S.-made products by 2030, aiming to bolster domestic supply chains and create job opportunities. The focus on domestic goods also comes against a backdrop where U.S. tariffs are throwing global supply chains into disarray. Looking abroad, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $4 billion investment to establish its first data centers in Chile, marking its third cloud region in Latin America. This expansion aims to support services like generative AI while addressing environmental concerns through innovative cooling technologies and a commitment to renewable energy. Additionally, Amazon’s latest Alexa+ voice assistant has reached 100,000 users, reflecting the company’s commitment to integrating AI into everyday consumer interactions. Innovating Across an Omnichannel Landscape Consumers expect a future where personalized recommendations, seamless transactions, and rapid fulfillment become standard. And as Amazon’s recent partnership involves delivering pet prescriptions, that promise extends even to Fluffy and Fido and other household pets. For both pets and people, data is becoming table stakes for building better experience. For example Sam’s Club, a Walmart subsidiary, is transforming its Member Access Platform (MAP) into a comprehensive “Retail Experience Network.” By introducing tools like Brand Lift, Customer Lifetime Value measurement, and AI-powered Propensity Modeling, Sam’s Club enables brands to create personalized, omnichannel campaigns that resonate with members both online and in-store. Ultimately, in the intensifying battle for retail dominance, Amazon and Walmart are accelerating innovation across the omnichannel frontier, blending digital convenience with physical presence in ways that reshape consumer expectations. Both giants are converging on a future where retail is channel-agnostic, delivery is instantaneous, and the shopping journey is seamlessly personalized. The arms race is less about stores vs. screens — and more about who can turn both into a single, intelligent system.

        "description": "Google doesn't think Eddie Cue is right about search. The antitrust trial targeting Google's search business is heading into the home stretch, and the outcome could forever alter Google—and the web itself. The company is scrambling to protect its search empire, but perhaps market forces could pull the rug out from under Google before the government can. Apple SVP of Services Eddie Cue suggested in his testimony on Wednesday that Google's search traffic might be falling. Not so fast, says Google. In an unusual move, Google issued a statement late in the day after Cue's testimony to dispute the implication that it may already be losing its monopoly. During questioning by DOJ attorney Adam Severt, Cue expressed concern about losing the Google search deal, which is a major source of revenue for Apple. This contract, along with a similar one for Firefox, gives Google default search placement in exchange for a boatload of cash. The DOJ contends that is anticompetitive, and its proposed remedies call for banning Google from such deals. Surprisingly, Cue noted in his testimony that search volume in Safari fell for the first time ever in April. Since Google is the default search provider, that implies fewer Google searches. Apple devices are popular, and a drop in Google searches there could be a bad sign for the company's future competitiveness. Google's statement on this comes off as a bit defensive.Read full article Comments",

But Apple is moving quickly to shut the external payments door opened by last week's ruling that the company willfully failed to comply with court orders regarding anticompetitive behavior. In an emergency motion filing late Wednesday (PDF), Apple described US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' \"extraordinary Order\" as including an injunction that \"permanently precludes Apple from exercising control over core aspects of its business operations, including charging for use of its property and protecting the integrity of its platform and in-app purchase mechanism.\" A certificate (PDF) accompanying the emergency filing states that the order \"fundamentally changes Apple's business and creates destabilizing effects\" for App Store customers. The restrictions, \"which will cost Apple substantial sums annually,\" are not based on the company's conduct, Apple claims, but \"were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance\" with the 2021 injunction. In her ruling (PDF), Gonzalez Rogers described Apple as conducting an \"obvious cover-up\" and said that Apple \"at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "iPhone maker Apple has confirmed the inclusion of a list of AI search providers in its Safari Browser. This will soon be available as a non-default option on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Bloomberg says Apple’s Senior Vice President shared the news during his court testimony recently, where he confirmed that it was in the works. This is also the first time that Apple mentioned the figure for a fall in searches for Safari. Therefore, it makes sense that the inclusion of AI sources would be key to providing alternative means to search for data.The matter is a lucrative one with the company and other search engines, where Apple would receive a share of advertising revenue through searches. Therefore, even if it’s on the lower end of usage, it would still make money, but less than before. Let’s not forget that Google might soon be stripped of Chrome, which would reduce its power to work as a monopoly in the search industry.Apple is currently generating $20 billion around the globe through revenue shares from Google search via Safari on Apple products. The testimony today arose as part of the evidence for Alphabet’s monopoly legal battle. This might mean its contract with Apple, where Google works as the default across Apple products, would go down the drain.Apple is very reliant on third-party firms for crucial AI functionality across devices. We’ve witnessed Apple work hand in hand with ChatGPT to better Siri’s services as part of the initial wave of intelligence features from Apple. Under this deal, the company is said to be providing access to ChatGPT to Apple without any additional costs in return for great exposure. This entails the potential to convert users to paid subscribers. To be placed inside Safari, it appears that Apple might wish to hit revenue sharing programs that are equal to what it generates through the Android maker Google. However, Apple says it looks forward to AI providers getting better and more competitive than Google in terms of general questions, and more in-depth search indexes.

People were already beginning to camp outside, so I quickly checked in, dropped my bags, then walked over to join the line with an energy drink.The first gentleman I spoke to was Dean, an excited data analytics guy from Colorado who was camped out with a sleeping bag.A college teacher and her students were playing poker on a giant tarp they'd brought. I joined in and spent the night flipping cards, placing bets, and waiting.I didn't notice the temperature dropping off until my body started shaking. It was freezing cold. People in the line were wearing solar blankets and looked like the Tin Man.John Di Bella III waited overnight to secure a good seat for Warren Buffett's yearly Q&A.John Di Bella IIIMorning rushAs the morning got closer, people got rowdier, and the lines tightened up. Thousands of Buffett fans showed up.When the doors opened at 7 a.m., it was complete chaos. We sprinted about 10 feet before realizing we had to go through a security checkpoint. There were security guards shouting at us to knock it off and we got the memo quickly.Once past security, we raced up the stairs, taking three at a time, then attempted to run-walk through the arena to reach the audience seating area. Security were yelling at anyone who ran.Eight hours of waiting paid off when we slid into the first bleacher row above the floor, maybe one or two sections from the front of the stadium where Buffett would speak.I've been to concerts in the past, but nothing that compared to a packed out stadium for one man who people really look up to and want to learn from.Selfie skillsDuring the break at 10:30 a.m., I went down to the stadium floor to see if I could get photos of VIPs.I realized Hillary Clinton was still in the room. A few passionate ladies in the line were calling out, \"Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\"I stood there thinking, \"How am I going to get her attention?\"I had a phrase in my mind from military school and blurted out, \"Madam Secretary, how are you today?\" She turned around with a smile on her face, walked over, and agreed to take a picture with me.John Di Bella snapped a selfie with Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and first lady.John Di Bella IIIThen Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, walked out. I was determined to get a picture with him.My partner's mother left her corporate senior management job to work at Apple back in 1997 when Steve Jobs rejoined the company.Having a photo of Tim Cook would be something funny I could text and be like, \"Hey, I saw your boss,\" but it also had sentimental value.After failing twice, I caught his eye and said, \"Mr. Cook, my mother-in-law works for you. Her name's Meghan. She loves you, sir. Can I get a photo with you?\"He smiled and replied, \"Absolutely. She's a great person. I know her. Tell her I wish her well,\" then posed for a photo with me.He also grabbed a selfie with Apple CEO Tim Cook.John Di BellaBreaking the newsDuring the Q&A, Buffett shared advice and interesting stories. I was exhausted, but the more tired I became, the more intently I listened.At one point he joked about how Tim Cook made more money for Berkshire Hathaway than he ever had. He was totally serious and it was such a humble thing to say.In the closing minutes of the session, Buffett's mannerisms changed and you could tell something important was coming.The room was quiet enough to hear a pin drop.Buffett announced he intends to step down at the end of this year and have his planned successor, Greg Abel, take the CEO role.After the bombshell, the entire audience stood and applauded that man for 10 minutes straight.I felt like I was personally speaking to Buffett saying: \"Thank you. Thank you for bringing me here. Thank you for everything that you have done for us. And thank you for the legacy that we will now remember you by.\"A video of the standing ovation for Warren Buffett, taken by John Di Bella III. pic.twitter.com/KpQzNdz3vf— Theron Mohamed (@Theron_Mohamed) May 7, 2025 Memorable meetingListening to Buffett provided the cheapest wisdom I've ever received. I put in nothing compared to what I experienced that day.The waiting, camaraderie, sleep deprivation, listening to stories, meeting Tim Cook and Hillary Clinton, all added to that historic day. I waited eight hours; I experienced a lifetime.We witnessed history being made — a page in the final chapter of one of the greatest stories written.All things considered, I think it was a pretty good trip.Read the original article on Business Insider John Di Bella III snaps a selfie with Apple CEO Tim Cook at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting.John Di BellaJohn Di Bella III waited in the cold for eight hours to get a good seat for Warren Buffett's Q&A.He \"witnessed history\" when Buffett revealed his plan to step down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO.The college student and Berkshire shareholder took photos with Tim Cook and Hillary Clinton.This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Di Bella III, a 20-year-old college student at Hofstra University in New York.

Apple is “actively looking at” revamping its Safari web browser to concentrate on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered search engines and shift away from Google search, potentially creating a colossal shift in the mobile browser landscape. This disclosure was made by Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue during his testimony in the U.S. Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet, the parent company of Google, according to Bloomberg on Wednesday (May 7). The lawsuit centers on the estimated $20 billion-a-year agreement that makes Google the default search engine in Safari on Apple devices. This legal challenge could potentially compel the two technology giants to dismantle the agreement. The consideration of AI search integration comes as AI technology gains traction with consumers. Cue noted a recent dip in Safari searches, which he attributed to increased use of AI. He expressed belief that AI search providers, such as OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Anthropic, will eventually supplant standard search engines like Google. Cue stated that Apple plans to add these options to Safari in the future. Apple has held discussions with Perplexity to implement this capability. According to Cue’s testimony, he previously felt that alternative search options were not “valid choices.” Presently, however, he said he sees “much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.” This move represents a major shift for Apple, whose users have relied on Google search in Safari since the iPhone’s debut in 2007. The company currently has more than 2 billion active devices worldwide. The testimony reportedly led to declines in both Alphabet and Apple shares on Wednesday. While Cue acknowledged the financial benefits of the current agreement with Google and the potential revenue loss, he also stated his belief that technology shifts, like AI, create opportunities for new entrants and true competition. Apple currently offers OpenAI’s ChatGPT via the Siri digital assistant and is expected to add Google’s Gemini later in the year. The company also reviewed Anthropic, DeepSeek and Grok from xAI for this purpose. Cue mentioned a “bake-off” between ChatGPT and Google’s offering before ChatGPT was selected for integration into Apple Intelligence in iOS 18 last year.

        "description": "Apple is considering reworking its Safari web browser across its devices to place a greater emphasis on AI-powered search engines, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The disclosure came from Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, during his testimony Wednesday in the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Alphabet. Cue was speaking about the two companies’ $20 billion-a-year deal that makes Google the default search engine on Apple’s browsers. The Apple executive said he expects AI search providers—like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity—to eventually replace standard sources like Google. Apple has already seen a decline in Safari searches for the first time last month, which Cue attributed to the growing use of AI. Still, he added, it’s too early for these platforms to become the default. Currently, Apple and Alphabet have a lucrative agreement that allows Apple users—across more than two billion active devices—to perform searches through Google. Initially, Apple agreed to use Google in its Safari browser for free. Eventually, the two companies agreed to share revenue generated from search advertising. A shift away from Google and the entry of multiple competitors into the space could jeopardize that profitable arrangement, which contributes significantly to Apple’s revenue. “There’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen,” Cue said about the switch from standard internet search to AI, according to Bloomberg.",

In the episode, Rogen's beleaguered studio head Matt Remick attends the Golden Globes, where a film he greenlit is nominated. Matt is stressed about the idea of not getting a shout-out in the acceptance speech — an ongoing bit is that every winner from a Netflix project effusively thanks Sarandos in their speech without fail.In the end, Matt has an encounter with Sarandos, who reveals he puts it in artists' contracts that they have to thank him in acceptance speeches. He also forces Matt to reckon with the fact that neither of them are artists — they're the \"bean counters\" supporting the real artists.The fictional world of \"The Studio\" seems to closely mirror the real world, where Netflix is dominating the streaming game while the streamer actually airing \"The Studio\" is struggling. Apple is losing over $1 billion a year on its streaming service and has roughly 45 million subscribers.

        "description": "Epic v. Apple litigation ushers in minor but user-friendly changes. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Apple was in \"willful violation\" of a court injunction that required the company to refrain from \"anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing\" in its tightly controlled iOS App Store. Part of the ongoing litigation between Epic Games and Apple, the injunction specifically forbade Apple from \"denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct purchasers to, other purchasing mechanisms.\" Following the ruling, Apple said it would comply with the court's injunction while the company continued to appeal the decision. The day after the ruling was handed down, Apple altered several of its App Review Guidelines to grant developers permission to do things they hadn't been allowed to do before. As summarized in an email to developers, reported by MacRumors: 3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others. 3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so. 3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront. 3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action. We're already beginning to see new versions of apps that take advantage of these changes. Case in point: Amazon's Kindle app for iPhones and iPads, which from its original launch in 2009 up until yesterday wouldn't actually let anyone buy books in the app. Users instead needed to navigate on their own to Amazon's store in Safari or on their PC and Mac and buy the books they wanted, at which point the books would be available in the Kindle app.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Philip Pacheco/Getty, Mega/Getty, Tyler Le/BIEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney — the guy behind Fortnite — has been fighting Apple over its App Store rules for five years.Last week, Sweeney won what could be a far-reaching victory — if it survives Apple's appeal. It may also bring Fortnite back to iPhones.Sweeney says he pursued the case for business reasons — but that there's also a moral component to his fight.There aren't a lot of people who can say they've beaten Apple. Tim Sweeney may have just earned a spot in that club.Sweeney is the CEO of Epic Games — best known as the company behind Fortnite — and he won what may be a very meaningful court victory last week, by forcing a significant change in the way Apple runs its App Store.Apple is going to appeal that ruling (and Sweeney is in a parallel fight with Google over its app store rules). But if the ruling stays put, it means the five years and the enormous amount of money Sweeney says he spent and sacrificed by challenging Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, will have paid off.Explaining why Apple's App Store rules are so important — to both Apple and the developers who complain about them — can be a drag, though I keep trying. I wanted to hear Sweeney's take on it directly because he's made the fight a core part of his job for half a decade.And I also wanted to know when I'll be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone — something I haven't been able to do since 2020, when Sweeney first started fighting with Apple. (I've asked Apple for comment, but they haven't expanded on the statement they made last week expressing their disappointment and plans to appeal.)You can hear our entire discussion over on my Channels podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.Peter Kafka: Why was last week's ruling important to you and Epic? And why should a normal person care about it?Tim Sweeney: This is really one of the issues at the heart of our digital freedoms for the future. We live our lives on our smartphones. We're connected constantly to people. We work on them. We play on them. And our futures are going to be ever more connected there. So the freedom for consumers and developers to do business together is of paramount importance. If you have one monopoly gatekeeper who dictates what people are allowed to play, see, hear — and takes exorbitant fees from every transaction that everybody does online — we're going to have a much less free world than the one that we grew up in.I started programming back on an Apple II when I was 13: You turn the computer on, you get a BASIC programming prompt. Anybody can write code, anybody can save it to a floppy disk, you can share it with a friend, you can sell it. Those digital freedoms are essential to the future.I subscribe to Netflix. I subscribe to Spotify. Neither of those is done through Apple because in both cases, neither of those companies wanted to pay Apple's fees. But I use Spotify and Netflix on my phone.I could maybe argue that it's a bit of a hassle for me to have to deal with Netflix on a website instead of directly through its iOS app. But it doesn't really seem like it's a sort of life and death situation for me or any of the companies involved.Apple has two tiers of rules. They have one tier of rules for what they call reader apps, which are basically apps operated by multi-hundred-billion-dollar companies — Amazon Video, Netflix, Spotify, and a number of others. Apple lets those apps do business outside of the app. And they've previously obstructed those developers from telling users about the better deals [you could get by going to those sites directly].But even with that restriction, which is now being taken away, it seemed like life was OK for me, life was OK for Netflix, life was OK for Apple. Everyone was getting what they wanted.It was not OK for game developers. Because that reader app exception only applied to streaming video, streaming audio, and ebook sites. Apple forced all games, all social media apps, and everything else, to only do business through their app. So Apple imposed a rule on all game developers, saying if you sell anything for your game anywhere in the world on any platform, then you must sell it on iOS, and you must use our payment method, and you must pay us 30% if your revenue is greater than a million dollars. So the game developers did not have a choice, and everything there was just marked up 30%.What happens given the ruling last week?It means now all users are free to learn about better deals from all developers, and all developers are free to not just accept payments outside of the app on the web, but to tell users about those alternative ways to pay and to give consumers better deals. That's a key economic gain here.Now developers will be able to send users to the web to give them a better price, and then to make a little bit more money for themselves, too.But that's just the first-order effect. The second-order effect is that you can expect if Apple continues to offer such a horrible deal, that everybody's going to move away and steer their customers towards iOS payments on the web. So I would hope that Apple would step up and compete, give developers a much better deal than 30%, and actually engage in competition. But whether Apple chooses to compete or not, the court has enabled developers to make the choice for themselves.Apple says they're going to comply with the judge's ruling, but they're also going to appeal it. So it's possible the rules get changed again. Do you think a meaningful number of developers are willing to take advantage of this window, knowing that it can get shut down?It's 30% of revenue, so all major developers will support alternative payments. Spotify was the first major app I saw that already has done it. Fortnite will do it later this week. And many, many apps are doing it.You said Fortnite is going to come back to iOS. You guys were kicked off the platform in 2020 for violating Apple's rules. There's nothing in the judge's ruling that says Apple has to reinstate Fortnite on iOS. Have you talked to Apple? How do you imagine Fortnite will come back to iOS?Epic has a valid [Apple] developer account in good standing. Our subsidiary Epic Games Sweden opened up an account in order to distribute Fortnite in the European Union.Our dealings with Apple on that account have been managed by their developer relations team, who have been cordial.Do you feel confident that I will be able to play Fortnite on my iPhone later this week?I believe so. I would be very surprised — well, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we had a bug that took a day or two more to fix — but I would be very surprised if Apple decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS.We've told Apple what we're doing.How much has it cost you to engage in this five-year legal fight?We've had legal bills in the matter of Epic vs. Apple of over $100 million.I assumed it was much more. You were hiring top-shelf lawyers and …Well, yeah. Well over $100 million, just in legal fees.But if you look at lost revenue, that's another story. We can't predict exactly how much we would have made on iOS, but in the two years that we were on the platform, Fortnite had made about $300 million on iOS. So you could have projected hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue as a result of the fight.And that's just from people who were playing and couldn't play. I'm thinking of the future players you would have gotten, who didn't get exposed to the game because they don't have access to it via their phone. Roblox has tons of young players. The majority there are teenagers or below. They're all getting to it via their phone. Those are all people who could have played Fortnite for the last five years.That's right. Metcalfe's Law is a real factor here. You're much more likely to play a game or use a social network if your friends are there. So Apple cutting off Epic from access to the entire iOS audience, that not only affects the players that are directly denied access to Fortnite, it also affects all of their friends who might have played Fortnite more or might have played Fortnite but didn't, because their friends weren't able to play.So you could easily imagine that there's been a billion dollars or more of impact to Epic in this time.I think freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. The world needs to change here. And if it doesn't change, then you're just going to have Apple and Google extracting all of the profit from all apps forever. And there will be no proper digital economy. It will just be monopolization.I understand the logic and emotion behind that argument. On the other hand: You're running a for-profit company. You have a lot of investors. They put a lot of money into you. Did they come to you at any point in the last five years and say, \"Tim, I know that freedom cannot be purchased at too dear a price. On the other hand, I've invested a lot of money in you because you're a games company, and your game is banned from mobile phones. Could you just settle this up and declare victory and move on?\"Other than one investor who exited Epic right quick, everybody has stood by us, because nobody invested in Epic because they want to make a 30% profit flipping the stock.They have invested in [us], believe in our vision, believe in our potential, and believe that if we succeed in building the metaverse and growing Fortnite from a game into an ecosystem, into an open platform serving literally billions of players, that it will totally have been worth it. They all realize that if Apple controls the spigot, the revenue spigot at the top of the funnel, they will use that control to extract all of the profit that will ever be made from this space.Do you imagine this is the rest of your professional life — running a business, coding, and then also having legal fights with platforms?There's a game and a meta game here, right? The game is making aweso",

Apple appealed after a judge found the tech giant violated a court order. The appeal came days after U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple disobeyed a ruling in a case involving Fortnite maker Epic Games and the Apple App Store, Seeking Alpha reported Monday (May 5). The ruling required Apple to permit greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in the App Store. “Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” Rogers said Wednesday (April 30), per the report. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.” Rogers also accused Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman of lying under oath about the timing of Apple’s decisions on its new commission policy. “Neither Apple nor its counsel corrected the now obvious lies,” she said, adding that the company had “adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this court.” Rogers handled the initial case, filed by Epic in 2020. Rogers had mostly ruled in Apple’s favor but still required the company to allow apps to offer external payment options. Apple began taking a 27% commission on these purchases and added a screen that could have scared some users amid security risks. Rogers ordered Apple to do away with the commission and the screen. In the wake of Rogers’ ruling, Apple said it would comply but disagreed and would appeal. The ruling’s financial impact is difficult to quantify, as it’s not yet clear whether Epic and other companies (such as Spotify) will be able to convince Apple customers to transact with them directly, PYMNTS wrote last week. While Apple may be appealing, “the status quo — the commission-based model that has been in place — is bumping up against uncertainty.” Bank of America said if the case did not go Apple’s way, it could affect “billions” of dollars of high-margin revenue, the Seeking Alpha report said. Apple is also facing regulatory battles in Europe tied to the App Store, as well as an antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice.

        "description": "Austin has been on a building boom since it started becoming a tech hub. The Texas city has seen its skyline shift and its fortunes grow. Major tech firms like Apple and Amazon have established key offices, and in the 2010s alone, the city grew 21%, adding 171,000 residents. It now has more than 974,000, the 10th largest in the country. Builders have raced to erect housing for these new arrivals; Austin has seen a boom in market rate apartments in recent years—so much that it led rents to decrease after years of big jumps. And in recent years, according to a new report, part of that building boom has included affordable housing, including permanent housing for the formerly unhoused, low-cost studio units, and even housing for teachers. Austin’s affordable housing construction pipeline outpaces all other U.S. cities, according to research from Yardi Matrix, a real estate data source. In 2024, the city delivered 4,605 affordable units—defined as properties that agree to limit rents as a condition of a tax credit or subsidy. That’s double the rate in 2023. The research shows Austin will also deliver the most affordable units this year, 3,452—more than LA’s 2,752, despite the California city having more than four times as many people. And Austin will continue to lead, with the forecast of units in the pipeline through 2027 showing Austin with 9,528, compared to Seattle’s 6,289. [Chart: Yardi Matrix] “We want to ensure that the population that made Austin what Austin is can stay in Austin,” said James May, Housing and Community Development Officer for the City of Austin Housing Department. It’s also worth mentioning that Austin’s changing demographics are playing a large role in the housing market. As the city continues to morph from a capital and college town to a tech and healthcare nexus, wealth and median income have risen. A recent city memo noted that the city’s housing market had dramatically changed since it laid out its housing plan in the mid 2010s—median home sale price has risen by 58%, and rents went from an average of $1,350 in 2017 to a peak of $1,709 in 2022—so Austin needs to recalibrate its strategy and focus more on deeply affordable units. “Austin used to be a city of musicians and artists, and now income and rent are far higher than what it was 10 years ago,” said Heather Way, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin who specializes in housing law. [Chart: Yardi Matrix] May credited the growth in affordable housing in Austin to three factors. First, was community: Multiple providers including the city, county, housing authority, and private builders have been looking to invest in new housing, with private developers investing in significant new construction using the city’s density-bonus program. The second was money. A series of local bonds for affordable housing raised significant funds for new construction, including a 2022 bond for $350 million, which helped fund new affordable units. In addition, the construction of new transit lines included $300 million in anti-displacement funds that also helped pay for new buildings. May said the city recently purchased a 100-acre property formerly owned by the Top Deal electronic company that it plans to use for mixed-income development, which will include affordable housing. And finally, the third pillar was regulatory reform. The city council has passed many initiatives in recent years to increase density and make it easier to build: transit-oriented development rules allowed for higher buildings near bus and train lines, Affordability Unlocked allowed housing development on land zoned for commercial projects, and the HOME Initiative shrunk the required lot size for homes and made it legal to build multiple units on lots zoned for single-family homes. But even with that surge, it’s still not enough. Despite Austin’s recent lead, the construction rate still lags well behind what’s actually needed to provide sufficient access to affordable housing: tens of thousands of new units would be needed to adequately meet the demand. A record-breaking number of evictions in the surrounding county last year attest to the pressure renters feel making ends meet. And while new supply is definitely a step in the right direction, what isn’t being built is deeply affordable housing. Defined as housing that can support those making around 30% of the median income; in 2023, just 63 such units were built, even though this group makes up 17% of the city’s population. Creating enough affordable units, and building more for those with extremely low incomes, will be even more challenging due to the changing landscape for construction. Stubbornly high interest rates will make getting financing more difficult. Tariffs will make materials more expensive. And the Trump administration’s actions against HUD, including threats to withhold funding from sanctuary cities like Austin, might end vital federal support. “It’s going to be a tough market, we won’t see the entire pipeline go all the way through,” May said. Austin’s boost in housing production is a start. But it’s sadly far from finished.",

Apple and Anthropic have reportedly partnered to create a platform that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to write, edit and test code for programmers. Apple has started rolling out the coding software to its own engineers, Bloomberg reported Friday (May 2). The company hasn’t decided whether to make it available to third-party app developers. The tool generates code or alterations in response to requests made by programmers through a chat interface. It also tests user interfaces and manages the process of finding and fixing bugs, according to the report. It was reported in August that while generative AI is not yet making money in some fields, it has quickly proven its value in powering coding assistants. As of the time of that report, one AI coding assistant, the Microsoft-owned GitHub Copilot, had drawn nearly 2 million paying subscribers since its launch in 2022 and contributed to a 45% year-over-year increase in GitHub’s revenue. Amazon, Meta, Google and several startups have also built AI assistants for writing and editing code. McKinsey said in 2023 that AI could boost the productivity of software engineering by 20% to 45%. This increased efficiency has far-reaching implications for businesses across industries, CPO and CTO Bob Rogers of Oii.ai told PYMNTS in an interview posted in May 2024. AI-powered tools enable developers to create software and applications faster and with fewer resources. “Simple tasks such as building landing pages, basic website design, report generation, etc., can all be done with AI, freeing up time for programmers to focus on less tedious, more complex tasks,” Rogers said. “It’s important to remember that while generative AI can augment skills and help folks learn to code, it cannot yet directly replace programmers — someone still needs to design the system.” It was reported in April that OpenAI was in discussions with Windsurf, an AI-powered coding tool, to acquire the technology. Windsurf, formally known as Exafunction, had recently been in discussions with investors to raise $3 billion. Last year, the firm was valued at $1.25 billion in a deal led by General Catalyst. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in April that OpenAI is building an AI agent that can do all the work of software engineers, not just augment their skills.

For several years, Apple has been leveraging its hardware and services to forge an ecosystem, as phones, tablets and computers are an on-ramp to higher margin subscriptions, streaming and apps. This week, the company posted earnings that showed headwinds to its top-line growth (to 5% on a consolidated basis). The services businesses grew by 11.6%, to $26.6 billion, outpacing the 2.6% gains seen in the product segment. But the services line slowed from 14% growth logged in the fourth quarter as measured year on year. On an absolute dollar basis, the services operations posted record revenues. The company’s financial statements indicate that the cost of the service sales is a bit more than 24%, which translates to a roughly 75% gross margin, compared to a company-wide 47%. It’s rather safe to assume that a significant slice of that gross profit falls directly to the operating income line, given the fact that that the non-hardware parts of the Apple ecosystem are inherently high margin. Though the company does not break out the individual components of the services, there are some indications that fundamental changes to the App Store business model may have a dampening effect on those high-margin revenue contributions. The Epic Ruling As reported this week, a federal judge ruled that Apple had been in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games lawsuit. The court had previously ordered Apple to let users pay App Store developers directly through a third-party link to avoid the 30% commission Apple charges developers. But the ruling noted that the company assessed a 27% commission to app developers for external sales. The order now states that the tech giant cannot collect commissions outside the App Store. Again, the financial impact is tough to quantify, as it remains to be seen whether Epic and other firms (like Spotify) will be able to move Apple customers to transact with them directly. In the meantime, Apple faces battles in Europe tied to the App Store, as it has been fined by the European to the tune of $566 million, as a result of what the EU said were restrictions that prevented app developers from informing customers of the App Store that they could transact outside the App Store. The Epic Games-related ruling details that “Apple estimated a revenue impact of hundreds of millions to billions under the no-commission model for customer [developer] adoption ranging from 10% of 25%.” In a statement emailed to PYMNTS on Friday, Spotify said that Apple has approved the latest Spotify app for U.S. consumers, which the company said via spokesperson Jeanne Moran “finally allow us to freely show clear pricing information and links to purchase, fostering transparency and choice for US consumers.” In another example of how big this business is, Apple said that App Store developer billings were $1.1 trillion in 2022, and said that more than 90% of that accrued to the developers “without any commission paid to Apple.” The remaining 10%, then — at $100 billion — seems to have at least some connection to Apple, and would have been subject to some commission. The new ruling means developers will keep all the revenue garnered from transactions that occur outside the App Store. The battle’s not over, it seems, given the fact that Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the call yesterday that the company will appeal the ruling. But the status quo — the commission-based model that has been in place — is bumping up against uncertainty.

Meta mentioned \"Trump\" just once in a press release from April 11.Big Tech executives have aligned themselves closer to Trump since he won the election. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the election, and Google donated $1 million to the inauguration fund. Apple CEO Tim Cook did the same.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also donated to the fund. On a podcast this week, Zuckerberg said, \"Our default as an American company should be to try to have a productive relationship with whoever is running the government.\"The absence of direct mentions of Trump is perhaps surprising given the disruption the president's trade policy has caused American businesses.Trump has said his goal in enacting broad tariffs is to rectify an \"imbalance\" that has \"fueled a large and persistent trade deficit in both industrial and agricultural goods,\" according to the White House.The tariffs have forced companies, especially ones that sell consumer goods, to rethink their strategies. During the ongoing 90-day pause on the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Trump issued in April, some companies have begun diverting inventory closer to their US markets and looking for alternatives to manufacturing in China, which has taken the brunt of the tariffs.While Big Tech avoided talking about Trump, they did have plenty to say about tariffs this quarter. Last quarter, tariffs only came up a handful of times.Amazon and Apple, the two biggest sellers of consumer goods, made up the bulk of Big Tech's tariff talk during the recent earnings calls. Amazon mentioned tariffs 16 times in its earnings call on Thursday. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that \"Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs\" and expressed some optimism that the company could still keep prices low.Apple, meanwhile, mentioned tariffs 26 times on its earnings call. Cook said the company \"had a limited impact from tariffs\" and was able to \"optimize our supply chain and inventory\" for the past quarter. He said he expects tariffs to add about $900 million to its costs this quarter — provided that the administration makes no further changes.Apple is also diverting iPhone production from China to India to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Cook said the company expects \"the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin\" in the June quarter.Microsoft CFO Amy Hood mentioned tariffs once on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Discussing Microsoft's personal computing revenue, which came in at $13.4 billion, she said, \"Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as tariffs uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated.\"Times have changed since this time last year, when Trump and his economic policies were out of sight and out of mind.Read the original article on Business Insider Big Tech had little to say about Trump during their earnings calls this week.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesTech giants didn't have much to say about Trump during earnings calls this week.The president's tariffs, however, came up a lot.Amazon and Apple discussed tariffs the most, mentioning them 42 times collectively.Big Tech had little to say about President Donald Trump during their earnings calls this week.Neither Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, nor Snap mentioned the president at all, according to a review of transcripts from Q2 earnings calls by AlphaSense, a market intelligence company.

Tim Cook had a tough challenge during Apple's earnings call: predicting the unpredictable.The Apple CEO faced questions about tariffs, China, and AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call on Thursday, and how they would shape the rest of the tech giant's year.He was able to provide more detail to some questions than others. On the impact of tariffs, the biggest question facing Apple, Cook said it's \"very difficult to predict beyond June.\"He gave some details about the potential cost to Apple, but it came with caveats. Cook told analysts and investors that Apple expected a potential $900 million hit for the June quarter \"assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change.\"Though many American companies have been left to grapple with the levies, understanding the full extent of the impact on Apple has been a hugely important question for the market, given the company's vast supply chain empire in China.\"As far as tariffs go, the uncertainty will persist as rules keep getting made and unmade, often overnight,\" Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at Forrester, a research firm, told Business Insider. China sales and diversification Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain away from China — something Cook addressed directly on the earnings call. He said the company expects \"the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin\" in the June quarter. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, a research firm, said exposure to China remains a huge issue.\"Previous investments in India are paying dividends, but it is impossible to divert huge volumes away from China in the short term, given how entrenched its manufacturing and supply networks are,\" Wood said.One of the other major worries facing Apple investors — Apple's ability to reverse declining iPhone sales in China — got less clarity.Sales in the Greater China region were down 2% for the quarter as Apple has been battling fierce competition from local players. Companies like Huawei now have 5G-enabled smartphones as capable as iPhones to entice Chinese consumers.Cook said that a program in China meant to help subsidize smartphone purchases for the company \"played a favorable impact on the results,\" but he said \"it's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much.\"Apple's AI bet Apple Intelligence, the company's late push into the generative AI arena that rivals like Google and Meta got a headstart in, has had a very slow start since its reveal at Apple's WWDC almost a year ago in June 2024.Cook didn't provide a clear timeline for when Siri, a key part of Apple Intelligence, would be released after being delayed earlier this year. Cook said that \"it's just taking a bit longer than we thought\" to bring Siri up to Apple's \"high-quality bar.\"\"The hiccups with that rollout have likely solidified the company's belief that it is better to do it right rather than move fast and break things,\" said Dipanjan.According to Cook, though, there's evidence that Apple Intelligence is turning out to be the revenue driver analysts had hoped for. \"During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available,\" Cook said in response to an analyst question.The unknowns on tariffs and AI weighed on Apple's earnings beat and 5% year-on-year revenue bump, with shares down almost 4% on Friday.

        "description": "Apple quickly approved updated app with payment links, prices, and promotions. After a federal court issued a scathing order Wednesday night that found Apple in \"willful violation\" of an injunction meant to allow iOS apps to provide alternate payment options, app developers are capitalizing on the moment. Spotify may be the quickest of them all. Less than 24 hours after District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple had sought to thwart a 2021 injunction and engaged in an \"obvious cover-up\" around its actions, Spotify announced in a blog post that it had submitted an updated app to Apple. The updated app can show specific plan prices, link out to Spotify's website for plan changes and purchases that avoid Apple's 30 percent commission on in-app purchases, and display promotional offers, all of which were disallowed under Apple's prior App Store rules. Spotify's post adds that Apple's newly court-enforced policy \"opens the door to other seamless buying opportunities that will directly benefit creators (think easy-to-purchase audiobooks).\" Spotify posted on X (formerly Twitter) Friday morning that the updated app was approved by Apple. Apple made substantial modifications to its App Review Guidelines on Friday and emailed registered developers regarding the changes.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Apple shares fell nearly 3% in premarket trade on Friday after the iPhone maker trimmed its share buyback program and CEO Tim Cook warned of additional tariff-related costs of about $900 million this quarter amid a raging Sino-U.S. trade war. The Cupertino, California-based company that makes over 90% of its products in China said it plans to shift production of iPhones to India to minimize the impact of President Donald Trump’s trade war. “It looks like Apple is progressing faster than expected with its move to shift production of US phones into the region (India),” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Analysts at Wedbush echoed this view, referring to India as Apple’s “life raft supply chain” as the company navigates through tariff turbulence. Cook outlined how Apple has started to build up a stockpile of products so that the majority of its devices sold in the U.S. this quarter will not come from China. “Tim Cook did his best to reassure investors on last night’s earnings call, but many likely came away still wanting more clarity about what lies beyond June,” Matt said, adding that the $900 million hit to profit turned out to be smaller than many had feared. Apple, which has been grappling with increased competition in key market China from rivals like Huawei due to slower rollouts of AI features, was already in troubled waters before the tariffs hit. “The question for investors is what can replace China for Apple? This is not an easy question to answer and could threaten the long-term trajectory of Apple’s growth plan,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. Despite electronics being exempted from U.S. President Donald Trump’s slew of import tariffs so far, Washington has signaled that some levies could be imposed in the coming weeks. Big Tech peers Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms beat quarterly estimates aided by artificial intelligence, while Amazon.com’s cloud revenue growth fell short of revenue expectations. These results were in stark contrast to dour forecasts from consumer electronics companies that are more exposed to tightening consumer budgets — chipmakers Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Intel. Apple shares lost about 15% so far this year. That compares with a 2.3% fall in Meta, and a nearly 1% rise in Microsoft. Apple’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 27.63, compared with Microsoft’s 28.64 and Meta’s 21.48.

Then it laid off staff.But first, Apple has been through the wringer.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.The big storyApple faces a major changeSean Gallup/ Getty ImagesA federal judge slapped Apple around.Referring to Apple's court case with Epic Games, the judge said on Wednesday that Apple \"outright lied under oath\" and that she would refer the company for possible criminal prosecution.In 2020, Epic accused Apple of anticompetitive practices tied to the App Store and in-app payments.The judge ruled against Epic in 2021 on almost all counts. But Epic did salvage one win: Apple had to let developers tell customers that they could leave the app and head to another website — where, theoretically, they could get more for their money if Apple isn't taking a cut.This week, the judge ruled that Apple was in \"willful violation\" of that ruling.Apple said it will comply with the court order — and they'll appeal it. BI's Peter Kafka has broken down why this could be an enormous issue for Apple.Then came the earnings report.It was a mixed bag. Apple beat revenue and EPS estimates, but also said it expects the cost of Donald Trump's tariffs to be $900 million in the current quarter. Sales in China were worse than expected. The stock is down 3% in premarket trading.CEO Tim Cook opened the earnings call by touting a recently announced $500 billion investment to boost US manufacturing over the next four years.In the more immediate term, Cook said he expects the majority of iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter to have \"India as their country of origin.\" Nearly all of the company's other products entering the US will come from Vietnam, he said.Cook also spoke about consumer behaviours and Siri's newest features being delayed again. BI has the six most important takeaways.3 things in marketsWall Street dealmaking slumpsSpencer Platt/Getty Images1. The best may be over for US stocks. Jefferies' Chris Wood says the stock market has already peaked, partly due to President Trump's tariffs damaging the US brand. Now, Wood has some advice for investors: Look abroad.2. Scott Bessent calls on the Fed to cut rates. The US Treasury Secretary pointed to bond yields as a reason Jerome Powell and the Fed should lower interest rates. The Trump administration has been clamoring for rates to come down, though Powell hasn't budged.3. So long, \"Liberation Day\" tech losses. Meta and Microsoft led a tech-stock comeback on Wednesday after AI dominated their earnings calls. Meta raised its 2025 capex guidance, indicating that AI infrastructure growth isn't slowing down.3 things in techDelian Asparouhov moderating a discussion with Emil Michael, Ruth Porat, and Kevin Weil at the Hill and Valley Forum.Julia Hornstein/BI1. Inside the \"Conclave of Silicon Valley.\" Tech titans and political power players descended on Capitol Hill for the hush-hush gathering known as the Hill and Valley Forum. BI had a writer in attendance; she said the forum showed just how tight tech's hold on DC is.2. Amazon narrowly beat expectations. The e-commerce giant's stock fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading as it reported weaker-than-expected earnings for Q2. On the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon was focused on keeping prices low as tariffs take effect.3. The new Meta AI app shows you other people's chats. The stand-alone version of the Meta AI assistant can come up with funny images and answer your questions. You can also scroll through other users' public AI chats — and that's where it gets weird.3 things in businessEdmon de Haro for BI1. Why Spotify's music discovery went downhill. Personalized playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar used to bring new music straight to your ears. After the company reoriented its priorities — and laid off some employees — its music discovery function fell off the deep end.2. McDonald's isn't lovin' its sales. The chain reported that US same-store sales were down 3.6% in Q1, the biggest decline since COVID lockdowns. Even as McDonald's tries to lure customers with its new value menu, the CEO said customers just aren't visiting as often.3. Advertisers are sticking with Meta, even with content moderation changes. The company's advertisers aren't too shaken up by the lax rules and shift to community notes. One former ad agency exec shared why he thinks Meta's ad business is still booming.In other newsTrump's advice to new grads: 'Find your limits and then smash through everything.'I scammed my bank.

Check out the Inside Chips podcast for our behind-the-scenes analysis of changes at Intel Foundry. Intel rolled out its updated process technology roadmap this week, along with early process design kit (PDK) for its 14A gate-all-around process technology. That node will utilize high-NA EUV, and include direct contact power delivery, the second generation of its backside power delivery technology. Intel also introduced boosted cell technology, which allows designers to mix higher-performing and more power-efficient cells within a design block. Additionally, Intel said its 18A process is now in risk production, with volume manufacturing expected later this year. Two new variants on the process, 18A-P with a focus on performance and 18A-PT for performance and power efficiency, also were announced. On the packaging front, introduced a new variant of its embedded multi-die interconnect bridging, EMIB-T, targeted at future high-bandwidth memory. Intel also is partnering with Amkor Technology on advanced packaging. Fig.1: Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Source: Intel EDA and IP companies announced support for Intel processes, including: Ansys power integrity signoff platforms and electromagnetic simulation software for 18A, along with a thermal and multi-physics signoff flow for EMIB and EMIB-T; Cadence digital and analog/custom design solutions and design IP for 18A, along with a reference flow for EMIB and EMIB-T; Keysight system-level chiplet design and die-to-die design solution for EMIB-T; Siemens physical verification and circuit verification software for 18A, along with a reference flow for EMIB-T, and Synopsys digital and analog flows, along with a reference flow for EMIB-T. In addition, Arteris joined the Intel Foundry Accelerator Ecosystem Alliance Program, and QuickLogic announced that it had optimized its eFPGA hard IP for 18A. The European Court of Auditors released a report on the EU Chips Act, warning that the current strategy makes it unlikely that the EU will achieve its target of having a 20% share of the global semiconductor market value chain by 2030 and urging the European Commission to start preparing a new approach. The EU Chips Design Platform, a consortium coordinated by imec, will facilitate access to advanced semiconductor design infrastructure, training, and capital for fabless semiconductor startups, small and medium enterprises, and research organizations. Also in Europe, the University of Southampton opened an e-beam lithography facility. SEMI‘s recent reports: Global semiconductor materials market revenue increased ~4% to $67 billion in 2024. Wafer fabrication materials revenue increased over 3% to ~$43 billion in 2024, while packaging materials revenue grew ~5% to ~$25 billion last year. Worldwide silicon wafer shipments increased 2% year-on-year in Q1 2025 to 2,896 million square inches, according to SEMI. 300mm wafers saw a 6% growth, while 200mm and smaller sizes declined.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said Thursday (May 1) that the company needs “more time” to upgrade Siri’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, as the AI assistant faces criticisms that it lags behind rivals such as Amazon’s Alexa and other voice-enabled AI chatbots. “We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar,” Cook said during Apple’s earnings call with analysts. “We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands.” When pressed by an analyst to specify reasons for the delay, Cook said that “There’s not a lot of other reasons. … It’s just taking a bit longer than we thought.” Apple had faced criticism about the progress of Apple Intelligence — Apple’s AI initiative — which experienced snafus, including hallucinating news alert items. Siri, in particular, was criticized for lagging behind competing chatbots, despite being a pioneer as the first AI assistant embedded in a smartphone. Siri co-designer Luc Julia has told PYMNTS that Apple’s obsession with perfection likely hindered Siri’s progress. Generative AI is famously hard to completely control because it hallucinates, said Julia, who is also the chief scientific officer of Renault. However, Cook said that consumers appreciate Apple Intelligence. In the markets where the company launched the AI system, sales of the iPhone 16 family of smartphones were stronger year over year compared to markets that did not have Apple Intelligence, he said. During the earnings call for its fiscal 2025 second quarter ended March 29, 2025, several analysts asked about the impact of tariffs to Apple’s top and bottom lines. Cook said that Apple expects to see a $900 million increase in costs due to tariffs for its fiscal third quarter based on the current tariff policy. “We estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our cost,” Cook said. Cook said India is now the source of “most” iPhones sold in the U.S. He also said that “almost all” of Apple’s iPads, Macs and Apple Watches sold into the U.S. are sourced from Vietnam. As for sales to the rest of the world, those Apple products would be sourced from China, Cook said. The CEO also said Apple had been diversifying parts of its supply chain to mitigate the risk from relying too much on one country. Cook said he expects to continue this policy. Shares of Apple fell 4% to $204.86 in after-hours trading. Read more: Apple Aims to Mitigate Tariffs by Sourcing All US-Bound iPhones From India Legal Headaches A day earlier, a federal judge rebuked Apple, saying the company is in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games lawsuit. The court had previously ordered Apple to let users pay App Store developers directly through a third-party link to avoid the 30% commission Apple charges developers. Instead, the judge said, Apple assessed a 27% commission to app developers for external sales. Apple also put up pop-up screens warning consumers that paying outside the App Store might not be secure. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers then ordered Apple to stop collecting commissions outside the App Store and stop sending these messages to consumers. The judge also asked the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of California to investigate Apple for criminal contempt. Cook said he disagreed with the judge’s ruling. “We’ve complied with the court’s order and we’re going to appeal.” However, Cook declined to comment on the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google for its search monopoly, which would have a big impact on Apple’s services business. Google pays Apple a reported $20 billion a year to be Safari’s default search engine across iPhones, iPads and Macs. Separately, Apple is also facing its own antitrust lawsuit, brought about by the Justice Department in March 2024, saying that it allegedly used its smartphone monopoly power to improve restrictive contractual terms on developers and withholding critical access points. Meanwhile, the EU fined Apple and Meta last month for violating its Digital Markets Act. Apple allegedly prevented developers from giving consumers other options to pay for apps besides through the App Store. By the Numbers In the quarter, Apple earned $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share and up 8% from a year ago, on revenue of $95.4 billion, up 5%. Wall Street analysts expected Apple to earn $1.62 per share on $94.4 billion in revenue for the just concluded quarter, according to FactSet. IPhone revenue was up 2% to $46.8 billion in the quarter, while Mac revenue rose 7% to $7.9 billion. IPad sales were up 15% to $6.4 billion. Wearables, home and accessories revenue fell 5% to $7.5 billion. In the like quarter year ago, Apple reported net income of $23.6 billion, or $1.53 per share, on revenue of $90.75 billion.

Spotify said Thursday (May 1) that it submitted a new app update to Apple that includes features made possible by a Wednesday (April 30) court order that required Apple to “loosen its iron grip on its App Store.” The ruling in the case brought by Epic Games requires Apple to stop restricting developers’ ability to communicate with their customers free of charge, Spotify said in a Thursday press release. When approved by Apple, Spotify’s app update will allow U.S. consumers to see pricing details on subscriptions, information about promotions and other details in the Spotify app; click a link to purchase the subscription of their choice; and seamlessly click the link to change subscriptions, according to the release. In addition, U.S. consumers will be able to use other payment options — not just Apple’s payment system — and in the future access other buying opportunities that will directly benefit creators, per the release. “If all of this seems obvious and user-friendly, you’re right, and we agree — these are the kinds of improvements that any app should offer its users,” Spotify said in the release. “The fact that we haven’t been able to deliver these basic services, which were permitted by the judge’s order four years ago, is absurd. The ruling made it clear that Apple deliberately abused its market power to intentionally harm others and benefit only itself. But thanks to this important ruling in the case between Apple and Epic Games yesterday, this should change ‘effective immediately’ — those are the judge’s words.” Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. A company spokesperson told Bloomberg after the court ruling: “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said in a Wednesday post on X that the company will return its game Fortnite to the U.S. iOS App Store next week. “Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,” Sweeney said in the post.

        "description": "Apple Inc.’s sales from China declined more than anticipated in the latest quarter, overshadowing otherwise solid results for the iPhone maker. Revenue from the country fell 2.3% to $16 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended March 29, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated $16.83 billion. Overall sales gained 5% to $95.4 billion, ahead of the $94.6 billion average estimate. Apple had projected percentage growth in the low- to mid-single digits.The shortfall in China is an ominous sign for what was once a growth market. Apple has lost ground to local phone brands, such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, and the government there banned foreign-made technology from some workplaces. Apple’s China-centric production also makes it especially vulnerable to tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Apple is struggling in artificial intelligence as well, especially in China.

A new ruling from a federal judge might change all of that.Cooper Neill/Getty ImagesYou probably don't spend much time thinking about Apple's App Store fees.Apple does: The fees are a major part of the company's revenue, and it has been fighting efforts to cut into them around the world.A new ruling from a federal judge may cut into them. If it holds up, it will be a major change for Apple.A federal judge just slapped Apple around: Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Apple was in \"willful violation\" of a 2021 ruling she had made, and that she would refer the company for a possible criminal prosecution.That's pretty newsworthy. But what about the rest of Rogers' ruling?Well, that could be pretty newsworthy, too.It's possible that this could finally be the thing that fundamentally changes the way Apple operates its App Store — an increasingly key source of the company's revenues.Or, it might not.Let's review.This week's ruling comes out of a court battle between Apple and Epic Games, the company that operates Fortnite, that started back in nearly five years ago.In a nutshell: Epic doesn't like that Apple requires Fortnite players and anyone else using iOS devices to make in-app purchases via Apple's homegrown App Store — and that Apple can pocket up to 30% of each transaction. In the summer of 2020, Epic deliberately violated Apple's App Store rules, which led to Apple essentially kicking Fortnite off of its iPhones and iPads, which led to the civil suit.Epic appeared to have lost its fight in 2021, when Rogers ruled against it on almost all counts. But Epic did salvage one win: Rogers said Apple had to let developers like Epic tell customers that they could leave the app and head to another website, where they could make transactions without Apple's involvement.This week's ruling holds that Apple violated both the letter and spirit of the original ruling and says Apple has to comply with it immediately. Meaning, in theory, that companies like Epic will be able to tell their customers using iPhones that they can get a better deal somewhere else, and that Apple won't be able to charge developers an onerous fee if that happens.An Apple rep says it will comply with the ruling, but will also appeal it.So on the one hand: This could be an enormous issue for Apple. If big players like Epic routinely convince customers to do transactions with them outside of Apple's app, it could cut into Apple's growing \"services\" business — an increasingly important part of Apple's income statement, as its core iPhone revenues flatten out. And it comes as Apple is facing similar battles around the world — the European Union just fined Apple hundreds of millions of dollars because of the way it operates the App Store in that territory.On the other hand: As noted above, Apple will appeal Rogers' ruling. So it's possible that the buy-outside-the-App-Store option won't be an option in the US for long.Just as important: What percentage of Apple users actually want to leave Apple's App Store to buy stuff for the games they're playing? We have no idea.Perhaps a lot of them will be motivated to do it, since they can theoretically get more for their money if Apple isn't taking a cut for itself. Or maybe most of them won't want to deal with the headaches of jumping out of an app, pulling out a credit card (or asking their parents for their credit card), and making purchases on a different platform.In theory, we're going to find out soon. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says he will bring Fortnite back to Apple's App Store next week. It's not clear, however, if Apple has agreed to that.

While tariff exemptions for smartphones and other electronics have so far allowed Apple to avoid the worst-case scenario, the situation remains in flux, further clouding the company’s prospects. Meanwhile Amazon garnered some unwanted headlines ahead its earnings, as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren released a letter slamming founder Jeff Bezos and his company, after the e-commerce giant denied it considered displaying tariff costs on some products. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management co-founder and managing partner, discusses his expectations for both sets of earnings and offers his outlook for the two tech giants.

On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn.The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there.The MsMicrosoft. It was a big win. The company reported $70.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share, or EPS, of $3.46, surpassing analysts' expectations. CEO Satya Nadella pointed to two things that drove the growth: AI infrastructure and cloud services. In an internal memo viewed by BI, the company's CFO also highlighted a \"glimpse of what's ahead.\" The stock is up almost 9% in premarket trading.Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year.

Tariffs will be a hot topic for investors as China, the main hub for Apple manufacturing, faces a 145% levy. An EMARKETER analyst highlighted three tariff-related issues that investors will want clarity on: \"Apple's ability to absorb, avoid, or pass on potential price increases, the financial impact of tariffs, and the timeline for effective supply chain diversification.\" The other big question mark: When will the promised Apple Intelligence-powered upgrade super cycle arrive? Here's what investors will be watching.Amazon. Wall Street is cautious heading into Amazon's first-quarter earnings. Analysts at JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank expect forecasts to be met or surpassed. However, investors' main focus will be the company's second-quarter guidance — the quarter in which the impact of tariffs is expected to be felt. Here's what some of the biggest banks are saying.3 things in markets1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months.2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon.3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI.3 things in tech1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces.2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday.3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs.3 things in business1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI.2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were \"no plans\" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work.3.

        "description": "\"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. ... The Court will not tolerate further delays.\" Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a Zoom call with press Wednesday night that the company is \"going to do everything we can to bring Fortnite back to the iOS App Store next week.\" That decision comes after a federal district court found late Wednesday that Apple was in \"willful violation\" of a 2021 injunction designed to allow iOS developers to steer customers to alternate payment processors for in-app purchases. That 2021 injunction wound its way through years of appellate review until January 2024, when the Supreme Court declined to hear a final attempt by Apple to overturn it. Since then, the District Court for Northern California has been holding a series of evidentiary hearings examining the internal development of Apple's so-called \"compliance plan\" for the injunction. In a scathing Wednesday night order, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Apple had engaged in a plan to \"thwart the injunction's goals,\" and then engaged in an \"obvious cover-up\" to prevent that plan from being revealed. Apple's response to the injunction in court has \"strained credulity,\" the judge said, and Apple's conduct has been egregious enough for the judge to refer the matter to the district attorney for Northern California \"to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\"Read full article Comments",

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said his company’s artificial intelligence service, Gemini, could soon become part of Apple’s iPhone. During court proceedings Wednesday (April 30), Pichai said he is hopeful that Gemini will be added as a built-in option on Apple’s smartphone this year, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Apple’s AI system, Apple Intelligence, uses its own models for most AI tasks available on the company’s phones, tablets and computers. However, the company has partnered with ChatGPT from OpenAI for integration with its Siri voice assistant and Writing Tools, a feature for creating and editing text, the report said. Pichai said he hopes that Gemini, a ChatGPT rival, will be added as an additional AI option on Apple products, per the report. He said he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook on the topic last year and hopes to have a deal hammered out by mid-2025. Apple and Google have longstanding tech partnerships, the report said. Google provides YouTube as a standalone app on the iPhone and powered the maps function on Apple products until 2012. Google is also the default search engine for Safari, Apple’s web browser. That arrangement is at the center of the government’s antitrust case against Google, where Pichai made his comments, according to the report. Apple will host its annual developer conference the week of June 9 and introduce new versions of its operating systems. If Google and Apple reach an AI deal, it will likely be announced then, per the report. Google is in the middle of its largest AI push yet. The company has integrated AI across its product lines, with 15 of its products each having more than half a billion users now using Gemini models. AI Overviews in search have reached 1.5 billion monthly users. In March, Google launched AI Mode, an experimental feature that permits more complex queries and advanced reasoning capabilities. “We continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that search is more useful for more of their queries,” Pichai said during a Thursday (April 24) earnings call, adding that AI Mode queries tend to be twice as long as those in traditional search.

        "description": "Noam Galai/Stringer/Getty, Getty Images; Tyler Le/BIElon Musk may have become bored with the solved problem of manufacturing EVs.Musk's focus shifted from EVs to AI, robotics, and politics, leaving Tesla's core business untethered.A Tim Cook-style CEO could take Tesla operations to new heights, similar to Apple's post-Jobs success.This \"open letter\" might be fake. It could be real. I don't know, but it reminded me of a column I've been wanting to write.The letter is purportedly from disgruntled Tesla employees who want Elon Musk to stop being CEO so the company can go back to selling lots of electric vehicles. His DOGE bender has damaged Tesla's brand so much that he should step back, according to this alleged letter.Even if this is a made-up missive, it raises an interest question: Why would the CEO of the world's most valuable car company wander off for months to pursue political dalliances when the electric vehicle battle has just entered a new, crucial stage?The answer may be simple: Elon is bored making cars.He spent the last decade working his butt off to pull Tesla out of near bankruptcy and turn it into the dominant EV company of the Western world. There was a lot of innovation and many sleepless nights.But now, one could argue, EV manufacturing is a solved problem. Tesla has gigafactories and other giant facilities around the world churning out hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year. The next stages are all about refining these processes and scaling efficient production — and, yes, persuading people to buy the products.This isn't really Elon's jam. He likes to invent new things, not tweak existing products. This story from The Information put it well when it described why Musk rejected his lieutenants' advice to pursue a cheaper EV, and instead went all-in on artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and robots.This quote, from a person familiar with the situation, stands out: \"I think Elon is just uninterested in making a [Volkswagen] Golf-type car. It just doesn't wake him up in the morning. He was, 'Let somebody else do it.'\"What type of new CEO would Tesla need?So, who else would do this at Tesla, and what would this mean for the future of the company?If Musk were to relinquish the CEO role, I think he'd need a Tim Cook-style executive to take the reins.Cook is a supply chain genius who took over Apple when Steve Jobs died in 2011. At that time, I was a tech reporter at Reuters and many experts were predicting doom for Apple.Like Musk, Jobs was a mercurial tech founder who was loved for his visionary inventions and feared for his brutal approach to people management. (Jobs also pulled Apple back from near bankruptcy.)In 2011, investors just couldn't imagine how Apple might continue to thrive without this creative driving force.In one way, they were right to worry. Since then, Apple has not launched many truly new and inventive products. The car project failed. The Vision Pro goggles have stumbled out of the gate (and followed Meta's Oculus anyway).In another way, though, Cook has taken Apple to new heights that were unimaginable 14 years ago. And he did it by taking another solved problem — smartphones — and perfecting it over and over and over again.Since 2011, Cook has obsessed over minute iPhone product tweaks, redesigned the chips in-house, switched out and negotiated (hard!) with hundreds of suppliers, and carefully evolved one of the world's largest supply chains in the face of pandemics and dictators.I asked Apple for comment on Monday and didn't get a response. I also emailed Elon and asked him if he wants to spend the next 10-plus years of his life tweaking Tesla's EV operations. I didn't get a reply, not even a poop emoji.Apple's now a $3 trillion companyThe value Cook has added since 2011 is astounding. Late that year, the company was worth about $350 billion. Apple is now valued at $3.2 trillion.By iterating intensely on an existing product — grinding costs lower and efficiency higher — this CEO has generated almost $3 trillion in shareholder value, and made Apple the most valuable company in the world.When Apple became the first company to pass $1 trillion in 2018, I edited a story by Mark Gurman that marked this moment. The piece quoted Tony Fadell, who helped Steve Jobs create the iPod. Instead of harping on about Jobs's legacy, Fadell focused mostly on Cook.\"Tim and team have done a masterful job of continuing to develop Steve's vision while bringing operational and environmental excellence to every part of Apple's business to achieve their unheard-of scale while continuing to grow unprecedented margins in the consumer electronics business,\" Fadell said.Tesla's '2011 Apple' momentI think Tesla could be at a \"2011 Apple\" moment right now.Musk hasn't died, but his passion for EV manufacturing may have faded.Like Apple back then, many Tesla investors can't image the company without Musk as CEO. But he could, in theory, step back from day-to-day leadership duties while continuing to work on newer, cutting-edge projects in the background, such as the Optimus robot.Meanwhile, a Cook-style executive could take the CEO role and start hammering away at the solved problem of Tesla's core EV business. This could also reduce the brand damage done by Musk's political foray.Apple shows what's possible in a scenario like this: Almost $3 trillion in market value created from basically doing an existing thing better and better. I asked Grace Kay, Business Insider's hot-shot Tesla reporter, who might be a good candidate to replace Musk as CEO. She suggested Omead Afshar, a low-profile, mild-mannered executive who once ran a major Tesla manufacturing operation and has become a trusted confidant of the visionary founder.Sound familiar?If you want to know more about Omead Afshar, check out Grace's amazing profile.

        "description": "Apple's earnings will be a key update for investors looking for answers regarding the impact of tariffs, China competition, and progress on AI. Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty ImagesApple will report its fiscal second-quarter earnings results on Thursday.Wall Street analysts expect the company to announce a pull-forward in demand sparked by tariffs.Focus is on Apple's reliance on China for manufacturing, a new stock buyback program, and any new products in 2025.Apple is set to report its fiscal year second-quarter earnings on Thursday in a much-anticipated report for Wall Street.The world's largest company will explain how the macroeconomic uncertainty related to President Donald Trump's trade policy is affecting its business, specifically the impact tariffs could have on its supply chain.A recent report said Apple is planning to move a bulk of its iPhone production destined for US markets from China to India.Apple shares are down 19% from their record high in late December and are down about 16% year-to-date.Here's what Wall Street expects when Apple reports earnings on Thursday.JPMorgan expects Apple to remind investors of its resilienceJPMorgan said Apple's second-quarter results should remind investors just how resilient it is amid rising macroeconomic uncertainties.The bank increased its quarterly revenue estimates for the company by more than $2 billion, to $95.8 billion from $93.5 billion, partly due to the company's likely increased sales ahead of potential tariffs.That would represent year-over-year revenue growth of more than 5%, coming in ahead of Apple's prior guidance. Meanwhile, JPMorgan expects Apple to guide \"favorably\" for low-single to mid-single digit revenue growth in its third-quarter results.JPMorgan also said Apple's stock price decline this year derisks it, making it an attractive holding for investors.\"We think given the pullback in shares (down -16% YTD and trading at 26x consensus FY26 EPS), investors are likely to reward the resilience near-term, which will at the bare minimum translate to lower downside risk to FY25 estimates even on a slowdown/digestion,\" JPMorgan said.JPMorgan rates Apple at \"Overweight\" with a $245 price target.Goldman Sachs: 6 questions investors will focus onAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said investors will be looking to hear answers to six key questions:How will tariffs impact margins and demand?How has the recently launched iPhone 16e performed?What are Apple's new product releases for the rest of 2025?How has Apple's competition in China evolved?What's next for Apple Intelligence?How could Google's anti-trust lawsuit impact Apple's revenue?As to the actual results, Goldman said it expects Apple to beat earnings per share expectations of $1.61 and revenue expectations of $94.0 billion in the quarter.The bank also expects Apple to announce a new stock buyback authorization, which it typically does during its second quarter. Last year, the company announced a $110 billion buyback program.Finally, Goldman said any hint at new products, including the rumored launch of an iPhone 17 Air or a foldable iPhone, could drive renewed excitement among investors.Goldman Sachs rates Apple at \"Buy\" with a $256 price target.CFRA: Expect a pull-forward in consumer demandAngelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said a pull-forward in consumer demand should help Apple beat Wall Street revenue growth expectations of 4% when it reports its second-quarter results on Thursday.\"We look for revenue growth to have exceeded Mar-Q expectations of 4%, partly reflecting demand pull-ins in the U.S. given policy uncertainty, especially for higher-priced products where tariff risk is greater,\" Zino said in a note last week.Zino said key areas of interest for investors on the call are Apple's continued growth of its Services business, an update to its capital spending plans, and how its business in China is faring.CFRA rates Apple at \"Buy\" with a $235 price target.Bloomberg Intelligence: Apple supply chain in focusThe looming tariff risk for Apple is likely going to drive investor questions to center around its massive exposure to China's manufacturing industry, according to Anurag Rana, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\"Apple's sourcing strategy will likely remain the most discussed topic on its 2Q earnings call given the company's high dependency on China for both assembly and components,\" Rana said in a note last week.Rana said that while Apple's products have been exempted from Trump's tariff list, there is still a risk that those surcharges return.In terms of sales, Rana said he expects strong results due to a pull-forward in demand from consumers, but that sales next quarter could weaken \"due to weak consumer spending\" and the lack of any new imminent hardware upgrades.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Apple will likely face tough questions on tariffs and AI from investors when it reports earnings this week. That’s according to a report Tuesday (April 29) from Reuters, which says the tech giant’s investors will want to know more about the delayed launch of Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) features, and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on its business. “Tariffs are a sword of Damocles for Apple — dangling, disruptive and politically charged,” said Eric Schiffer, chairman of Patriarch Organization, a California-based private equity outfit that holds shares in the iPhone maker. According to Reuters, while Apple enjoyed a flurry of orders for the iPhone 16e before the tariffs were announced, Wall Street analysts are still projecting a drop in iPhone sales, the second such quarterly decline in a row. Apple is reportedly planning to offset the tariffs by sourcing all its iPhones for the U.S. market from India, with plans to get all its U.S.-bound iPhones from that country by the end of 2026 The Reuters report notes that Apple has been slower than rivals Samsung and Google at introducing new AI features. Upgrades to its voice assistant Siri are on hold until next year, while Apple has pulled an ad campaign promoting AI features that were not yet available. Apple has also faced AI hiccups in China, where it has been losing ground to domestic smartphone makers like Huawei. Earlier this year, Apple teamed with Alibaba to develop AI services for Chinese customers, but it’s not clear when they will debut. Meanwhile, a recent research note from Morgan Stanley argued that consumers’ perception of Apple’s AI platform is more favorable than that of investors. In the research note provided to PYMNTS, the investment bank said it found that the Apple Intelligence platform has been downloaded and engaged with by 80% of eligible American iPhone owners in the past six months, has an above average net promoter score of 53, and is marked by customers as “easy to use, innovative, and something that improves their user experience.” “While much of the public critique of Apple Intelligence is warranted, and investor sentiment and expectations on Apple’s AI platform couldn’t be lower, our survey of iPhone owners paints a more positive picture,” Morgan Stanley said in the note.

It's been a quarter marked by flip-flopping tariff announcements from President Donald Trump, supply chain challenges, and questions about iPhone pricing as a result.Thursday afternoon will be Apple's moment to speak for itself on the fate of its products and manufacturing. Tariffs, of course, will be the vocabulary word for this earnings season, and the company is facing steep rates if things continue how they are.Jacob Bourne, analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER, said there are three key tariff-related issues for this earnings call: \"Apple's ability to absorb, avoid, or pass on potential price increases, the financial impact of tariffs, and the timeline for effective supply chain diversification.\"With Trump's most recent 145% tariff on goods imported from China, the main hub for Apple manufacturing, the iPhone maker is reportedly exploring the next best place to make its products.Although India has a proposed rate of 26% once the 90-day pause on additional tariffs is lifted — and if the US and India don't negotiate a trade deal — it's a better deal than importing goods from China.On April 11, it looked like Apple may have gotten a break when the US Customs and Border Protection announced an exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other tech devices that left warehouses on or after April 5. They would still be subject to the fentanyl-related 20% tariffs on Chinese goods that were levied in February.Two days later, however, Trump made it clear that \"nobody is getting off the hook\" for tariffs in a post to Truth Social, though it's unclear what those tariffs could look like.\"The reported plan to shift all US iPhone assembly to India by 2026 signals that Apple is taking tariff threats seriously, but this transition faces significant logistical hurdles,\" Bourne said.Research from financial services firm Morningstar suggests that India is responsible for 20% of global iPhone production while China makes up more than half, William Kerwin, senior tech analyst at the firm, told BI.The question of how tariffs will impact consumers remains unanswered ahead of Thursday's call. As for the short-term, some users have said they're upgrading as soon as possible to avoid paying $2,000 or more on a new iPhone.Looking ahead, investors will want to know how much of the tariff-related costs will need to be passed on to consumers, said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.The fourth question that Apple will likely need to answer for investors isn't tariff-related, but rather around the progress of Apple Intelligence going into Q2.\"The tariff brouhaha may have distracted many Apple watchers from the AI conversation, but this intrinsic factor remains vital to Apple's success,\" Chatterjee said.Its big AI rollout has been stunted by delays and low demand despite being hailed as a new era for Apple. Bullish analysts expected the software to drive demand and take iPhone sales to new heights, but it hasn't happened.Chatterjee said investors will, once again, ask when \"the promise of an Apple Intelligence-powered upgrade super cycle come to fruition.\"Apple is known for keeping things short on earnings calls when it comes to stickier subjects. During the last call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said it was \"monitoring the situation\" when asked about tariffs in January, and he left it that.\"I don't expect much transparency from Tim Cook or the team,\" Kerwin said.Read the original article on Business Insider Tim Cook will have some tough questions to address regarding Apple's Q2 and beyond.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple is set to report Q2 earnings on Thursday amid tariff and supply chain challenges.Tariffs will be a hot topic for investors as China, the main iPhone producer, faces a 145% levy.Investors haven't forgotten about Apple Intelligence either, analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee says.The past three months have been a whirlwind for Apple, and they're expected to address the chaos on Thursday.The tech giant will report its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings to investors later this week.

        "description": "A barrage of economic data points and Big Tech earnings are coming. From inflation to jobs data to Apple earnings, here's what's on tap for the stock market. Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress via Getty ImagesA barrage of economic data and high-profile earnings could shift markets this week. Investors will get updates on inflation, the labor market, and economic growth. Meanwhile, four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will report earnings. Investors are bracing for a flood of new data and earnings to sift through this week, with inflation, jobs, and GDP prints on tap through Friday, while Big Tech firms report first-quarter results.Markets are watching for any signs of an economic slowdown as anxiety builds concerning the looming impact of tariffs. While the effects of President Donald Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs of 10% on most countries won't be seen in first-quarter data, traders will be on high alert for signs that the economy is weakening as duties kick in. Talk of stagflation—which sees inflation staying high while the economy slows— has risen, making the coming GDP and personal consumption expenditures readings highly important for markets. Meanwhile, all eyes will also be on the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants, four of which are slated to report earnings this week.\"This will contribute to a whopping 40% of S&P 500 market cap reporting this week. It's fair to say that these Mag-7 earnings will go a long way to dictating the tone of the week,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.Here's what's coming for markets this week. TuesdayConference Board Consumer Confidence SurveyConsumer sentiment will kick off the week's big economic data points, and could be pivotal for investors nervous about a spending pullback. US shoppers have increasingly signaled pessimistic feelings about the economy, prompting fears that weaker spending could dent earnings. The index hit a multi-year low last month.WednesdayADP Private Payroll ReportThe monthly tracker of private payrolls will inform markets as to the health of US labor — any fallout implies that growth may be starting to buckle. It is a leading indicator ahead of a highly-anticipated jobs report published Bureau of Labor Statistics, due out on Friday.The median forecast is for 110,000 private payrolls added in March, compared to 155,000 in February. Q1 GDPFirst-quarter US economic growth will be a key data point for investors wary of a potential recession, a scenario that commentators say has grown more likely amid Washington's tariff policies. After the economy notched a 2.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter, economists expect a stark slowdown, estimating a 0.2% expansion. Dropping consumer sentiment, disrupted trade, and labor market jitters could all play a role.However, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast predicts a GDP print of -2.5% for the quarter. Personal Consumption ExpendituresThe Fed's favorite inflation gauge will help investors determine how the early months of Trump's tariff policies have impacted prices for consumers. An upside surprise could send markets reeling amid rising worries of tariff-induced stagflation.Wall Street expects PCE to rise 2.2% year-over-year in March compared to 2.5% in February.Meta EarningsThe Facebook parent will report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, setting the tone for big topics like artificial intelligence spending and broader strength of the mega-cap tech trade that's boosted the stock market for much of the last three years. Bank of America expects healthy first-quarter results and sees the company's AI-driven ad improvements playing out for several more quarters. However, Meta's guidance for the current quarter may be conservative, the bank predicted. Analysts expect Meta to report revenue of $41.3 billion for the quarter and earnings per share of $5.23. Microsoft EarningsAlongside Meta, Microsoft will also report its quarterly performance. Strong AI and cloud demand are expected to bolster the firm's results, with analysts at Cantor especially encouraged by capex shifts to more operational spending.Analysts expect Microsoft to report revenue of $68.4 billion and earnings per share of $3.22. ThursdayAmazon EarningsThe e-commerce titan will follow report on Thursday, with results projected to come in strong. However, second-quarter uncertainty is much higher, BofA said, and the looming questions related to the impact of tariffs could dictate Amazon's earnings outlook and future plans.Analysts expect Amazon to report revenue of $155.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.36. Apple EarningsApple will close out this week's Magnificent Seven line-up. According to Morgan Stanley, it's known that the firm benefited from iPhone sales being pulled forward as consumers rushed to buy new devices ahead of possible tariff disruptions. Investors will likely seek clarity on trade topics, Apple's exposure to China, regulation, and the firm's AI projects.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $94.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.61. FridayApril nonfarm payrolls reportThe week will close out with one of the most crucial data points: monthly payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The April report will be a crucial indicator of how the labor market is holding up amid deep uncertainty and whether US employers continue to add new hires at a brisk pace. Any decisive shift in unemployment or job growth could send recession fears spiking and shift interest rate expectations for the year. Consensus forecasts expect US employers added 124,000 in April compared to 228,000 added in March. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.2%.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Nvidia shares fell early on as the Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei is getting ready to test a new and powerful artificial intelligence processor that the Chinese tech giant hopes can replace some Nvidia products. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are edging lower, while Tesla, Meta and Apple are muted. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it’s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with President Donald Trump and the US due to the imbalance of trade between the two nations. Lori Calvasina, Head of US Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets, explains why larger firms are better positioned to navigate the uncertainly than their smaller peers.

        "description": "New ChoiceJacking attack allows malicious chargers to steal data from phones. About a decade ago, Apple and Google started updating iOS and Android, respectively, to make them less susceptible to “juice jacking,” a form of attack that could surreptitiously steal data or execute malicious code when users plug their phones into special-purpose charging hardware. Now, researchers are revealing that, for years, the mitigations have suffered from a fundamental defect that has made them trivial to bypass. “Juice jacking” was coined in a 2011 article on KrebsOnSecurity detailing an attack demonstrated at a Defcon security conference at the time. Juice jacking works by equipping a charger with hidden hardware that can access files and other internal resources of phones, in much the same way that a computer can when a user connects it to the phone. An attacker would then make the chargers available in airports, shopping malls, or other public venues for use by people looking to recharge depleted batteries. While the charger was ostensibly only providing electricity to the phone, it was also secretly downloading files or running malicious code on the device behind the scenes. Starting in 2012, both Apple and Google tried to mitigate the threat by requiring users to click a confirmation button on their phones before a computer—or a computer masquerading as a charger—could access files or execute code on the phone.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "If you’ve followed Apple for any length of time, you’ve no doubt come across the notion that the company doesn’t rush into adopting cutting-edge technology; instead, it waits until it can do it right. “We don’t feel an impatience to be first,” CEO Tim Cook told Bloomberg in 2017. “Our thing is to be the best and to give the user something that really makes a difference in their lives.” But I’m starting to wonder if something else is going on. Sure, a lot of Apple’s Android competitors have sometimes been accused of throwing features at the wall. These days, though, I think their hardware is often just markedly better—and it hits the market earlier. There have certainly been times when Apple has waited and knocked it out of the park with its own implementation of a new component or product category. Touch ID was far faster and more reliable than any previous fingerprint reader. Apple Pay was a comprehensive use case for Near Field Communication that worked seamlessly compared with prior solutions. The Apple Watch might not have been perfect at launch, but it was (and is) light years ahead of other smartwatches. Other examples fall into a gray area. Take wireless charging. “Having to create another device you have to plug into the wall is actually, for most situations, more complicated,” Apple senior VP Phil Schiller said in 2012. Five years later, the iPhone X and 8 launched with Qi charging that worked the exact same way, without any particular special sauce. Today, Apple has by far the most convenient setup with its MagSafe ecosystem, and it has set the bar for the new Qi2 standard. But that doesn’t change the fact that it was years behind on the basic functionality. More recently, there have been cases in which Apple is simply late. AI is an obvious example, but camera hardware is more pertinent. For many years, Apple could and did lay claim to having the best phone camera around. But it’s impossible to make that case today if you have any experience with the top Android phones on the market. Some of that comes down to software tuning, but hardware plays an equally big role. In fall 2023, Apple introduced its “tetraprism” camera to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, upping the focal length from 3x to 5x. Apple presented this as a new approach to lens design, and in some ways it is; it doesn’t have the characteristic rectangular shape of “periscope” telephoto lenses on other Android phones, although the principle is the same. But Apple couldn’t claim any major performance breakthrough, except over itself. Take the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, released at the start of that year; its 5x telephoto lens was paired with a bigger sensor, and the difference in clarity was stark. Apple had been rumored to be lining up suppliers for periscope telephoto cameras since 2020, and even had filed patents on the technology in 2016, but it doesn’t seem to have gained anything by waiting so long to bring the concept to market. Huawei and Oppo, meanwhile, were shipping impressive periscope cameras back in 2019. It was a similar situation with 48-megapixel image sensors, the main new feature on the iPhone 14 Pro camera in 2022. Again, it’s not clear what took Apple so long to introduce this—the first 48-megapixel sensors made their way to Android phones in early 2019, and they worked the exact same way by combining four pixels into one for better 12-megapixel shots. In recent years, the state of the art in Android phones has been 1-inch image sensors, the same size you’ll find in enthusiast compact cameras like Sony’s RX100 line. Once you’ve used one, it’s hard to go back; these phones take photos that just don’t look like they came from a phone. The technology is mature, but at least from the outside, Apple does not seem all that interested in keeping up. It’s possible that Apple’s scale makes it harder for the company to secure cutting-edge components in the quantities it requires for each launch. The first tetraprism lens was only available on the iPhone 15 Pro Max before making it to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro the following year, for example. Android OEMs ship so many more individual models that it’s easier for them to reserve high-end parts for certain flagships. I’ve been thinking about this dynamic lately when reading reports of Apple’s belated entry into folding phones, a category Samsung kicked off in 2019—albeit with some well-publicized hiccups. Last month Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple plans to use technologies from a slimmer iPhone this year in a folding phone that could land “as early as 2026.” I’m not sure this checks out. According to Gurman, the 2025 “iPhone Air“ will be around 2 millimeters thinner than current models; the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.3 millimeters thick. The thinnest folding phone out there today is Oppo’s Find N5, which has a near-invisible crease in its display and is just 4.2 millimeters thick when unfolded. At this point, what could Apple really be learning by producing a phone closer in thickness to the iPhone 16 Pro? The Find N5 isn’t just impressive hardware—it’s a phone that makes you wonder how much thinner it could even be. Make it a fifth of a millimeter thicker, and I’m not sure it would still fit its USB-C port. (Gurman does note that Apple also plans to investigate the possibility of port-free iPhones.) But more to the point, the Find N5 is already on the market. At this point, I would not expect Apple’s first attempt at a folding phone to break new ground on a technical level. Six years on from the original Galaxy Fold, it seems unlikely that foldable hardware is going to get meaningfully better than what’s out there right now. Apple’s software is broadly excellent and its ecosystem is unparalleled, which is why I continue to buy iPhones myself. The Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch really are the best products available in their given categories, so I’ll always want a phone that works well with them. But something is going on with the iPhone. It’s simply no longer the case that Android companies can’t compete on hardware or design. If Apple ever wants to dazzle the world with mobile devices again—or at least hardware obsessives like me—the window may be closing.",

        "description": "In December 2023, I wrote an article exploring Apple CEO Tim Cook’s most likely successors, because there will come a day when he steps aside as chief executive at the iPhone maker. I wrote the piece in response to rare comments Cook had made—to Dua Lipa, no less—revealing that Apple has “very detailed succession plans” in preparation for his departure. Cook tried to alleviate investor fears of a near-term departure by saying that he still planned to be at Apple “for a while.” But as I noted at the time, that’s a subjective phrase—and one Cook used nearly 18 months ago now. A lot has changed since then. Hell, a lot has changed in the tech world over the past three weeks alone, ever since Trump unleashed his disastrous “Liberation Day” tariffs, sending tech supply chains—and tech stock prices—into chaos. Those tariffs have gotten me thinking a lot again about Cook, and those succession plans he announced a year and a half before President Trump lobbed an economic grenade at the world. All this has got me believing that Cook should pause any retirement plans he’s had in the works and stay on as Apple’s CEO until at least the end of Trump’s second term, in January 2029. Because the way things are going with the Trump-induced economic turmoil, Apple is going to need Cook more than ever these next four years. And Cook is uniquely suited for the challenge in two key ways. The “ops guy” cometh When historic tariffs require a company to completely rethink its supply chain, you want an operations guy in charge, someone deeply familiar with the company’s logistics and supply chain. That’s precisely what Cook is, and his operations mastery is one of the main reasons Apple made it through its previous most economically challenging time—the late 1990s. While Steve Jobs gets all the credit for Apple’s late-’90s rebirth, the fact is that Jobs probably wouldn’t have been able to save the company without Cook’s help. Jobs had come back to Apple in 1997 and quickly reimagined its product lineup, but that much-needed creativity injection wasn’t going to fix Apple’s other major problem at the time: its cumbersome supply chain, which had put massive financial and logistical challenges on Apple for years. In 1998, Jobs hired Cook as Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide operations, and Cook immediately went to work overhauling Apple’s operations—from manufacturing to shipping to asset allocation. This clean sweep of Apple’s operations that Cook led enabled the company to ramp up and distribute the product innovations en masse that Jobs would soon start pumping out, including the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. Cook’s ruthless optimization of Apple’s supply chain, ironically, was often used against him by those unhappy with Apple’s announcement in 2011 that he would succeed Jobs as CEO. Cook was an “ops guy,” his detractors argued, when Apple needed another “product visionary” like Jobs. I won’t rehash much of what I’ve already argued before, but while Steve Jobs was a creative genius and beloved tech leader, the simple fact is that the “ops guy” has grown Apple into a larger technology juggernaut, by orders of magnitude, than Jobs ever could have. When Jobs passed away in October 2011, Apple’s market cap was just north of $300 billion. Last year, after just over 13 years of Cook’s leadership, Apple’s market cap reached more than $3.7 trillion. Now, of course, Apple has lost nearly a fifth of that value since, largely thanks to Trump’s chaotic tariff war decimating tech stocks. But that’s exactly one of the reasons Apple needs Cook more than ever. Tariff barriers—especially of this historic scale—often require a reorganization of global supply chains. Who better to be at the helm of one of the company’s most affected by those barriers than a CEO who is arguably one of the best “ops guys” in business history? But it’s not just Cook’s deep understanding of global operations that is the reason Apple needs him. It’s also because Cook has shown time and again that he is one of the most skilled business leaders when it comes to engaging with President Trump. In the arena with Donald Trump In late 2024, Tim Cook received a lot of criticism from the left for being one of the many tech CEOs to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Cook received even more criticism in January when he personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. Many progressives saw these actions as hypocritical, especially coming from the CEO of what has been historically considered a very liberal-leaning company. Yet these actions make more sense when you look at comments Cook made about his willingness to work with governments of all stripes shortly after President Trump’s first election victory in 2016. As reported by TechCrunch in December 2016, Cook was asked by an Apple employee on an internal company message board about how important he believed it was that Apple engage with governments. The question came a week after Cook and other tech leaders met with the then-first-time president-elect. Cook answered that it was “very important,” noting, “Governments can affect our ability to do what we do. They can affect it in positive ways and they can affect in not so positive ways.” He went on: “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best.” In the years since making these comments, Cook has proven this answer wasn’t just lip service. Throughout Trump’s first term, Cook frequently engaged with the president—and because of it, he got Trump to exempt Chinese-sourced components critical to Apple’s products from the tariffs Trump raised against Chinese imports in 2019. This potentially saved Apple billions—and probably saved Americans from paying more for iPhones. Further proof that Cook has learned how to deal with Trump successfully comes from Trump himself. As CNN reported in November 2019, Trump had been asked earlier in the year why he seemed to have such a special relationship with Cook. “Oh, I have it with everybody, but he’s the one that calls me,” Trump answered. “You know why? That’s why he’s a great executive because he calls me, and others don’t. Others go out and hire very expensive consultants, and Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly. Pretty good. And I would take their call, too, but the only one that calls me is Tim Cook.” “I helped Tim Cook recently” This close attention that Cook pays to Trump is likely one of the reasons why Trump took a call from Cook in October 2024. Cook was reaching out to express his concerns about recent financial penalties the EU levied against Apple, to the tune of around $14 billion. The BBC reported that Trump told Cook that he would not let the European Union “take advantage of our companies” (but noted that in order to make good on that Apple-friendly promise, he first needed to get elected again). And just last week, there was more evidence—again directly from Trump—that Cook has successfully used his relationship with the president to achieve other favorable outcomes for Apple. On April 11, the Trump administration announced tariff exemptions for certain electronic goods imported from China, including Apple’s iPhones and computers, thus sparing the Cupertino company from a tariff bill of up to 145% for each item imported. A few days later, as noted by 9to5Mac, when Trump talked about his flexibility concerning the tariffs he has imposed, he seemed to allude to the recent exemptions being done, at least in part, to help Cook. “Look, I’m a very flexible person. I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said. “And you have to be. You just can’t have a wall, and you’ll only go—no, sometimes you have to go around it, under it, or above it. There’ll be maybe things coming up. I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook recently.” Trump didn’t explicitly say how he helped Cook, but The Washington Post reported earlier this month that Cook was heavily involved in getting Apple, and others in the U.S. tech industry, an exemption from Trump’s most recent tariffs. The White House denied that Trump did any specific favors for Cook. Still, Trump’s comments again show that he, the most powerful person in the world, seems proud of being able to help Cook out. That likely wouldn’t be the case if Apple’s CEO hadn’t so skillfully managed his relationship with Trump over the years. “Tim has a very good relationship with the president, and rightly so . . .,” Wilbur Ross, Trump’s commerce secretary during his first term, told the Post. “In general, he has a lot of respect because he’s not a public whiner, he’s not a crybaby, but comes with the real voice of reality. It’s no surprise to me that his suggestions are being well received.” The president whisperer All of this shows that Tim Cook has a better relationship with the president than most other tech CEOs who are not involved politically with his administration. That is an extremely powerful advantage for Apple during an era becoming defined by the worst economic uncertainty America has seen since the pandemic. Trump is unpredictable, and unpredictability is very bad for companies. However, Cook’s relationship with the president seems to go a long way in helping Apple mitigate the risks associated with that unpredictability. That’s something Apple can’t afford to lose right now. It is highly unlikely that a new CEO—even one fr",

Apple has reportedly accelerated its plan to source all its iPhones for the U.S. from India, in response to new U.S. tariffs. While the company previously planned to increasingly prioritize India-made iPhones for sale in the U.S., it now plans to get all its U.S.-bound iPhones from India by the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported Friday (April 25). Apple plans to double its production of iPhones in India from the 40 million units assembled in the country during the fiscal year ended in March to 80 million, according to the report. During the year ended in March, it increased its production in India by 60%. The company’s iPhone sales in the U.S. currently total 60 million units, the report said. Apple and its suppliers began moving away from China during the pandemic, but that shift sped up after the U.S. announced tariffs and new tensions arose during the two countries, per the report. Although the Trump Administration exempted smartphones and other electronics from its reciprocal tariffs, it left in place another 20% tariff on China, according to the report. It was reported April 7 that Apple planned to send more iPhones made in India to supply the U.S. market as a way to deal with U.S. tariffs. Making the products in the U.S. — which is the stated goal of the new tariffs for all goods — is a “nonstarter” because that would be much more expensive than paying the tariff, The Wall Street Journal reported. Apple also stocked up on iPhones ahead of the tariffs — which should delay the impact of the tariffs until into the next quarter — and the company is likely to squeeze its suppliers and lower its margins in order to keep the prices of the devices from soaring. On April 10, it was reported that Apple flew as many as 1.5 million iPhones into the U.S. as an anti-tariff measure. The company campaigned to get Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to make it through customs from 30 hours down to just six hours. Apple “wanted to beat the tariff,” a source told Reuters at the time. The post Apple Aims to Mitigate Tariffs by Sourcing All US-Bound iPhones From India appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Apple aims to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China, its main manufacturing base, a source told Reuters. Apple is holding urgent talks with contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata to achieve that goal, said the person, who declined to be named as the planning process is confidential. Apple, Tata and Foxconn did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple sells over 60 million iPhones in the U.S. annually with roughly 80% of them made in China. The tech giant is now looking to move the majority of that production to India, the source said. Apple has already stepped up production in India to beat U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, shipping some 600 tons of iPhones worth $2 billion to the United States in March. The shipments from India marked a record for both its contractors Tata and Foxconn, with the latter alone accounting for smartphones worth $1.3 billion, Reuters reported last week. In April, the U.S. administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Washington has since paused most duties for three months, except for China. Trump’s administration has since signalled openness to de-escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has raised fears of recession. The Financial Times first reported about Apple’s plan on Friday. As Apple diversifies its manufacturing beyond China, it has positioned India for a critical role. Foxconn and Tata, its two main suppliers there, have three factories in all, with two more being built. —Munsif Vengattil, Akash Sriram, and Disha Mishra, Reuters",

Apple is reportedly making another organizational change as it aims to accelerate the development of its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings. The company will remove its “secret robotics unit” from the purview of its AI chief, John Giannandrea, weeks after doing the same with its Siri voice assistant in March, Bloomberg reported Thursday (April 24), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, the robotics unit will move to Apple’s hardware division and be placed under Senior Vice President John Ternus. Giannandrea will continue to run most of the company’s AI efforts, and the removal of the robotics unit will allow his group to focus on that technology, the report said. The robotics team reportedly aims to create a new product category for Apple by using AI to power devices, per the report. The team is working on a tabletop robot that can move an iPad-like display, and has discussed building a mobile robot that would include videoconferencing capabilities, the report said. It was reported in February that Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots for smart home applications. In April 2024, it was reported that Apple was considering entering the personal robotics market as it looked for new opportunities for growth after ending its electric vehicle project. As for the company’s recent organizational changes, it was reported March 20 that when Siri was removed from the oversight of Giannandrea, it was placed under the leadership of Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. The leadership changes associated with that move came after an annual offsite meeting of Apple’s senior leaders, the “Top 100,” at which the company’s AI efforts were a key topic of discussion. On Tuesday (April 22), it was reported that Apple’s work on Siri will be led by managers who developed Vision Pro, as Rockwell is bringing members of the Vision Pro management team to Siri, replacing or demoting previous managers of the voice assistant business. While Vision Pro has not been a commercial hit, Rockwell’s leadership of the development of the device showed his ability to produce a well-regarded operating system and product.

        "description": "Companies like Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are using large amounts of water to meet the energy demands of their data center, and they have used a lot of water in the last four years, which is impacting the environment negatively. After collecting environmental and sustainability reports in 2024 by these companies, it was found that most of the water consumption was done by Google in 2023. Google used 24 million cubic meters of water in 2023, which is equivalent to filling 26 Olympic-sized pools every day in a year. If we compare this water consumption to how much an average man consumes in his average lifespan, it's only 25 cubic meters of water. Google uses water that 1,300 people consume in their whole life in just one day. Even though other companies used less water than Google, it's still a large amount. Microsoft used 7.8 million cubic meters of water in 2023, which is equivalent to filling 9 Olympic pools every day, while Apple consumed 6 million cubic meters of water, from which 7 Olympic pools can be filled every day. 3 million cubic meters of water were used by Meta in 2023, which is the least out of the big four companies.Also read: What Countries Are Leading In Investment In AI? The 2025 Index Report Reveals!132,344,557 cubic meters of water were used by Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Google from 2020 to 2023. Which is equivalent to 52,938 Olympic-sized pools in total, or 13,234 pools annually, with average daily consumption reaching 36 pools. Microsoft’s water consumption increased by 87% from 2020 to 2023, with Google’s water consumption increasing by 69%, Meta’s by 40%, and Apple’s by 25% from 2020 to 2023.

        "description": "The European Union has rolled out hefty fines for tech giants Meta and Apple. The world’s biggest tech giants were fined nearly $796 million (combined) for non‑compliance with the DMA. These were reportedly the first penalties shared for going against the highly debatable legislation in that part of the world.iPhone maker Apple’s (€500 million or $568 million) penalty had to do with the policies shared on the App Store. The company was warned to enable users to install apps from different stores owned by third parties in the region. This was in early 2024, and at the time, it complied with the guidelines. However, as per regulators, it stopped developers from marketing those options through their apps. As a result, users couldn’t make the most of the diverse and cost-effective offers as the company stops developers from bringing these offers to users’ attention. The organization was said to fail at proving that such restrictions are necessary and adequate. Other than the huge fine, the EU ordered the Cupertino firm to get rid of any restrictions on app developers so they could provide alternative options to users.On the other hand, Facebook’s parent firm received a slightly smaller fine of $227 million (€200 million) for how it handled the controversial cookies subject between March and November last year. At the end of 2023, both Facebook and Instagram rolled out what the EC referred to as Consent or Pay models for advertising. This meant EU users would have the chance to get rid of ads as a whole by paying a subscription fee of $10.5 each month. As per the EU, this was not in line with the Digital Markets Act and didn’t give users the choice to select a service that makes use of less personal data. Meta rolled out a new system that it feels uses less personal information to show ads, which is currently under scrutiny.For now, the tech giant is getting fined temporarily before such a system comes into play. Meanwhile, there is a reason to celebrate as the EU claims Facebook’s marketplace wouldn’t come under the DMA any longer since it entailed less than 10k business users last year.The Digital Markets Act is a major instrument for unlocking the true potential and options of users by making sure digital players operate across fair and competitive markets. This ensures all EU consumers remain protected at all times and work across a level playing field.Both companies were labeled by the EU for falling short of complying with the Digital Markets Act by rolling out measures that reinforce how dependent business users and others are on these apps.Now, both companies need to pay their penalties within a two-month mark or else they would risk paying heftier fines for every day that passes by. For now, Apple claims it’s preparing to appeal the decision, and it looks like Meta won’t be sitting down in silence either, as shared by a recent report by the New York Times.

        "description": "Over the past 30 days, many big-name tech giants have seen their stock prices fall hard, largely thanks to President Trump’s chaotic tariff rollout. For example, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has seen its shares fall 11% over the past month, while Nvidia has seen its shares fall (Nasdaq: NVDA) fall over 12%. But until yesterday, IBM (NYSE: IBM) was one of the big-name tech giants that rode out the tariff storm pretty well. While IBM’s stock price did tank along with the rest of the markets in early April, it has recovered nicely since then and, as of the close of bell yesterday, its shares were actually up just a bit (about 0.6%) over the past 30 days. But then IBM announced its Q1 2025 results yesterday, and its stock sank after hours. And today, as of the time of this writing, IBM shares are down more than 6.75% in pre-market trading. The main reason? You can blame Elon Musk’s DOGE. IBM Q1 2025 results When a stock drops after a company reports its latest quarterly results, it’s natural to assume it is doing so because the company in question posted poor numbers. But that actually wasn’t the case with IBM yesterday. By all accounts, IBM had a pretty good quarter. Here are its most salient numbers: Revenue: $14.5 billion (up 1%, or up 2% on a constant currency basis) Earnings per share (EPS): $1.60 As noted by CNBC, those critical metrics actually beat analysts’ estimates, which had expected revenue of $14.4 billion and an EPS of just $1.40. “We exceeded expectations for revenue, profitability and free cash flow in the quarter, led by strength across our Software portfolio,” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a statement announcing the company’s Q1 results. “There continues to be strong demand for generative AI and our book of business stands at more than $6 billion inception-to-date, up more than $1 billion in the quarter.” But if this is the case, why did IBM’s shares drop? It’s all because of DOGE. IBM stock price falls as DOGE takes a bite out of its government contracts biz Unfortunately for IBM’s stock price, the company also announced last night that 15 of its government contracts had either been canceled or paused due to cuts initiated by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Bloomberg reports that these cuts equate to about $100 million in future payments. Addressing the cuts on the company’s financial call, IBM’s chief financial officer, James Kavanaugh, said that federal sales account for less than 5% of the company’s overall revenue. However, Krishna noted that DOGE’s downscaling of the U.S. government did leave IBM’s consulting unit “more susceptible to discretionary pullbacks and DOGE-related initiatives.” As noted by Reuters, the impact of the DOGE cuts on IBM’s business sent the company’s shares lower in after-hours trading yesterday. IBM issues rare quarterly guidance But IBM also announced something else yesterday—guidance for the second quarter. Historically, IBM has not issued quarterly guidance, but as Reuters notes, the company decided to do so now. “We’ve chosen now, in light of the very unprecedented dynamic of uncertainty going on in the market, to give a second-quarter revenue guidance range. We felt incumbent upon ourselves to give as much transparency as possible to our investor group,” IBM’s Kavanaugh announced yesterday. That forecast revealed that IBM expects Q2 2025 revenue of between $16.40 billion and $16.75 billion. That’s slightly above analysts’ forecasts of $16.33 billion, noted Reuters. Still, that attempt at reducing uncertainty in investors didn’t do enough to counteract the effects that the DOGE cuts had. In premarket trading this morning, as of the time of this writing, IBM stock is down 6.75% to $228.90. As of yesterday’s close of $245.48 before IBM’s Q1 results were released, the company’s shares had been up over 11.6% for the year so far—an impressive return considering all the market turmoil over the past three weeks.",

        "description": "According to Counterpoint report, Apple is leading the global PC shipment growth with a 17% rise, while the overall global PC shipment has risen 7% in Q1 2025. However, the future of the market looks uncertain, especially with the current tariffs, which are stopping many potential buyers in the Q1 from buying PCs. Now, the future depends on how OEMs are going to spread their supply chains. The thing to note is that Apple’s share of global PC shipments increased from 9% in 2024 to 10% in 2025, with 57.5 million PCs shipped in Q1 2024 to 61.4 million in Q1 2025. Before the tariff rush, there were also some other PC makers that saw growth. 11% growth was seen by Lenovo, after Apple’s 17% growth. Other companies that saw a rise in global PC shipments in Q1 2025 were Asus (9%), HP (6%), and Dell (4%). Overall, the leading PC maker in 2024 was Lenovo, with 25% of market share, followed by HP (21%) and Dell (16%). One of the biggest issues many PC makers are experiencing is that a lot of PCs are manufactured in China, which is the country facing the most US tariff threats. Apple has also announced a $500 billion investment that it is going to open a 250,000 square foot facility in Houston, which will have servers for Apple Intelligence over the next four years. Many of the US assembled machines also import many parts like GPUs, CPUs, and motherboards, and shifting production to other countries isn't an option as well either. These uncertainties about tariffs can make new devices even more costly which will discourage purchases and slow down growth.Read next: IEA Report: AI Won't Worsen Climate Change, But Data Center Energy Usage Must Be Managed",

Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal “We were losing the light, and still about 20 kilometers from the main road, when the car shuddered and died at the edge of a strange forest. The grove grew as if indifferent to certain unspoken rules of botany. There was no understory, no foreground or background, only the trees themselves, which grew as a wall of bare trunks that rose 100 feet or so before concluding with a burst of thick foliage near the top. The rows of trees ran perhaps the length of a New York City block and fell away abruptly on either side into untidy fields of dirt and grass. The vista recalled the husk of a failed condo development, its first apartments marooned when the builders ran out of cash.” This is the opening to our latest Big Story, which we are excited to share today. It’s all about how Apple (and its peers) are planting vast forests of eucalyptus trees in Brazil to try to offset their climate emissions, striking some of the largest-ever deals for carbon credits in the process. The big question is: Can Latin America’s eucalyptus be a scalable climate solution?

        "description": "One of the central arguments in the ongoing antitrust trial against Google revolves around its deals to secure default search engine status on various devices, such as the iPhone. Most consumers simply want their devices to work out of the box and rarely adjust default settings. This week, it was revealed that despite the looming threat of a potential breakup over such practices, Google is continuing a similar strategy in the AI space. According to Bloomberg, testimony in the trial disclosed that Google is paying Samsung “enormous sums” for its Gemini assistant to be the default on Samsung smartphones—a deal that began in January. Google reportedly outbid other major AI providers, including OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft. This mirrors Google’s approach to traditional search almost to the letter. A core argument of the government’s case has been how Google has used its vast resources to buy its status as the default search engine on many of the world’s most popular products, making it impossible for competitors to get any kind of foothold. To be the default on iOS alone, Google reportedly pays Apple $20 billion a year. As a result of that deal and others like it, Google’s market share in search has been hovering at 90% for more than a decade, leaving Bing, DuckDuckGo, and everyone else with single-digit scraps. Now with AI, the consequences of a Gemini default could be even more dramatic. Besides shutting out its AI rivals, Google’s domination as the default assistant on phones would paint a dire picture for publishers and content creators. What a dominant Gemini could mean AI search engines have existed for a couple of years now, so we know a few things about how people use them. Industry data shows a pretty clear trend: AI search creates substantially less referral traffic to websites than traditional search. Publishers, of course, depend on search traffic for audience growth and advertising, and this tension is the main reason many news publishers are either inking content licensing deals with AI providers or launching lawsuits against them. OpenAI has been prolific in the number of publishers it has signed deals with, and Meta and Microsoft have also shown a willingness to pay for content. So far, however, Google has shown very little interest in doing the same. It’s deployed AI Overviews—and, more recently, AI Mode—to search results without giving publishers a dime. It hasn’t yet applied AI summaries to Google News, but it’s clearly interested in putting more AI in its search products over time. The exception to Google’s no-deal rule is Reddit, which signed a deal with Google in February 2024 that reportedly involved the search giant paying Reddit $60 million a year to access its repository of user-generated content. While it shows Google isn’t philosophically against signing licensing deals, Reddit is a unique case: Its archive is vast, and it’s all human-created—exactly the kind of data AI systems thrive on. No single publisher has an archive that’s nearly so attractive, and Google doesn’t want to set a further precedent of paying for content, since it would dramatically alter its business model. On the other side, publishers are still dependent on Google for search traffic, so they won’t risk being kicked off Google services entirely if they poke the bear with a lawsuit. There’s simply too much to lose. The power of the AI default That’s why the media has a lot riding on the result of the Google antitrust trial. It’s not just about splitting up Google’s interconnected businesses—it also could have a large effect on how publishers get paid for their content in the AI era. Samsung’s market share is significant (about 23% in the U.S. and worldwide), and it may end up being the tip of the spear. If Google is allowed to keep the Samsung deal in place, the logic almost certainly rolls downhill to Apple. Apple has been struggling to bring AI to its ecosystem, and it’s yet to launch the fully powered AI Siri it unveiled last year. A Gemini preload on the iPhone, sweetened by the sort of multibillion-dollar fee Google already pays for default search, would let Apple fill the gap without rushing unfinished tech to market—and it would leave publishers facing a closed loop on roughly half of U.S. smartphones. The courts will soon decide whether this strategy even survives its collision with antitrust law. Amit Mehta, the judge presiding over Google’s case, is expected to issue a ruling this summer, and the Justice Department is lobbying for options that range from banning “default” payments outright to forcing Google to spin off Chrome into its own company. The media already has good reason to worry about the rise of AI, which is upending business models and potentially redefining copyright. But an AI future where Google is as dominant as it is in search today would be even more worrisome. It would be the worst of both worlds: no licensing checks and no search referrals, because user queries never leave the on‑device chat box. Regulators might call this the next default monopoly. Publishers might call it something else—extinction economics.",

The European Commission fined Apple 500 million euros (about $566 million) and Meta 200 million euros (about $226 million) Wednesday (April 23), saying the companies violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple breached the DMA’s anti-steering obligation by imposing restrictions that prevent app developers from informing consumers about offers that are available outside Apple’s App Store, the commission said in a Wednesday press release. Together with the fine, the commission ordered Apple to remove these restrictions, per the release. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. In a statement provided to CNBC, the company said: “Today’s announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.” In the case of Meta, the commission said in its press release that the company breached the DMA’s obligation to enable consumers to choose a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the “personalized ads” service. Meta’s “Consent or Pay” model, which was introduced in November 2023 and required EU users of Facebook and Instagram to consent to personalized advertising or pay a monthly subscription for an ad-free service, does not comply with the DMA, the release said. Another model that Meta introduced in November, which uses less personal data to display ads, is being assessed by the commission and is not included in this decision, according to the release. Meta responded to the decision with a statement saying that the commission is trying to handicap American businesses while allowing Chinese and European ones to operate under different standards. “This isn’t just about a fine; the commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multibillion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,” Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in the statement. “And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising, the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.” These are the first penalties imposed under the DMA, Reuters reported Wednesday. The report added that Google and X may be the next firms to face such fines. The post EU Fines Apple and Meta for Digital Markets Act Violations appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Some top tech firms often keep interview candidates waiting four weeks for a response - it’s become common practice, from Apple to Adobe. And with over a third of candidates previously rejecting an offer due to a negative interview experience, the processes seem to be getting worse as the competition between candidates gets stiffer. It’s been reported that hiring has also slowed in recent months, meaning recruiters and candidates are battling for fewer roles - 64% of recruiters agree with this. One result of the change in the number of roles available is that companies are now able to extend their interview processes. This is because more candidates are willing to sign up for a long process, due to the lack of opportunities. Digital PR agency Reboot Online was interested in the interview experience for candidates applying to the best companies in the world. They assessed the Glassdoor profiles of the 100 highest-ranking companies in the Forbes World’s Best Employers List . The experiences of more than 300,000 candidates were reported on the website and analyzed by Reboot to reveal which companies had the highest percentage of negative and positive experiences. They also assessed the reviews to find out which companies had the most difficult interviews, based on their difficulty rating submitted by candidates. Which companies have the hardest interview process? Company (Industry)Average Difficulty Score (/5)Google (IT Software & Services)3.4NVIDIA (Semiconductors, Electronics, Electrical Engineering)3.2Rolls-Royce Holdings (Aerospace & Defense)3.2Salesforce (IT Software & Services)3.2Meta Platforms (IT Software & Services)3.2Microsoft (IT Software & Services)3.1Adobe (IT Software & Services)3.1Amazon (IT Software & Services)3.1Alibaba Group (IT Software & Services)3.1Apple (Transportation and Logistics)3.0 The most common trend observed by Reboot Online’s analysis of the most difficult interview processes is that difficult interviews do not always correlate with bad experiences. They discovered that although candidates may report a hard interview, they often report a lower percentage of negative experiences compared to other companies. This is likely because the companies in the top 10 are well-established and could come under scrutiny if their processes are too harsh or dismissive of rejected candidates. Reboot Online found that candidates interviewing for Google / Alphabet report the highest difficulty score among the 100 best companies globally. Renowned for their challenging nature and hiring the best talent in tech, interviewees report an average difficulty score of 3.5 out of 5. The company lives up to its reputation for being tough to break into. Candidates note Google’s focus on complex problem-solving, critical thinking and a deep understanding of technical concepts. Despite this high difficulty score, 67% of Google candidates still left the challenging interview feeling like it was positive. While just 13% described it as negative. A handful of companies fall into second place with an average difficulty score of 3.2. NVIDIA, the computer manufacturing corporation, Rolls-Royce Holdings, an aerospace company, Salesforce Inc., a software company, and Meta Platforms, a technology company, all report the second-highest score. Candidates recall interviews from all companies to be comprehensive and rigorous as they assess both technical proficiency and cultural fit across all difficult types of roles. Their competitive hiring processes attract top-tier candidates, allowing them to be more selective than others. Interestingly, Salesforce and Rolls-Royce candidates both report high levels of positive interview experiences, with 80% and 75% of positive experiences, respectively. Salesforce have an in-depth blog post on their careers page about interviewing with the company, which helps candidates to understand the process. Features like this one help interviewees enter the interview and leave with a positive perception of the company - they feel like they’ve been helped out, rather than left in the dark. Which companies have the worst interview processes? While each candidate has reported their own individual experiences using the Glassdoor reviews, there are some key trends which can be identified and have emerged from each company's processes. Company (Industry)Percentage of Negative InterviewsSpotify Technology (IT Software & Services)37%Indeed (IT Software & Services)29%PayPal (Banking and Financial Services)28%Shopify (IT Software & Services)28%Netflix (Media & Advertising)28%Nintendo (Media & Advertising)26%Logitech International (Semiconductors, Electronics, Electrical Engineering)25%Adobe (IT Software & Services)22%Deutsche Telekom (Telecommunications Services, Cable Supplier)22%Shiseido (Construction, Chemicals, Raw Materials)22% Reboot Online found that the company with the highest percentage of candidates reporting negative experiences is Spotify. Among the world’s top 100 employers, almost two in five report a bad experience interviewing at the company. Some of the complaints among candidates include recruiters ghosting them following an interview, generic rejection emails after their long process and even some interviewers arriving late. Despite this high volume of complaints, 46% reported a positive experience; however, this is still the lowest among all of the top 100 companies. Interestingly, Spotify do have the lowest number of employees among Forbes’ ranking, so it's not surprising their hiring team may be under more stress than others. Surprisingly, 29% of candidates recall negative interviews at Indeed. Despite being the world’s top job site, it ranks second overall for the worst interview experiences. With over 1,800 candidate reports on Glassdoor, Indeed is one of the four IT companies to feature in the top 10, potentially suggesting a wider industry issue. In joint third place are PayPal, a multinational financial technology company; Shopify, an E-commerce company; and Netflix, a media company. These well-known companies follow closely, with 28% of candidates reporting negative interview experiences. Despite all three of these being known as highly desirable places to work, the fast-paced cultures don’t leave all candidates with a good impression, as almost one in three left unhappy with the interview process. However, of these companies, PayPal candidates report the highest percentage of positive experiences at 52%. Shopify follows closely with 51% and Netflix with 49%.Read next: • These Are the Countries Offering the Best Opportunities for Immigrants in Terms of Career Growth• Study Shows Instagram and TikTok Are Toughest for Achieving Social Media Virality• Data Reveals: Meta's Facebook, Twitch, and Likee Experience Major Declines in Popularity",

The European Commission issued a €500 million fine to Apple and a €200 million fine to Meta yesterday, saying that both companies violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The companies are required to bring their platforms into compliance within 60 days or face \"periodic penalty payments,\" the EC said. These are the first two non-compliance decisions adopted by the commission under the DMA. The EC said it determined that Apple breached its anti-steering obligation and that \"Meta breached the DMA obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.\" \"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said European Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc’s digital competition rules.The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store.The commission, which is the EU’s executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified “periodic penalty payments,” the commission said.The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.The penalties were issued under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It’s a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do’s and don’ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech “gatekeepers” from cornering digital markets.The DMA seeks to ensure “that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,” Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.“The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,” Virkkunen said.Both companies indicated they would appeal.Apple accused the commission of “unfairly targeting” the iPhone maker, and said it “continues to move the goal posts” despite the company’s efforts to comply with the rules.Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement that the “Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.”In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.Among the DMA’s provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end “non-compliant” conduct.Apple said it has “spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.”“Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,” the company said.The EU’s Meta investigation centered on the company’s strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union’s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users’ online interests and digital activity.Regulators took issue with Meta’s model, saying it doesn’t allow users to exercise their right to “freely consent” to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also including Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don’t want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it’s “currently assessing” this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option’s impact.“This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,” Kaplan said. “And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.” —Kelvin Chan, AP Business Writer",

        "description": "iPhone maker Apple is being accused of falsely misleading its iPhone 16 users. The tech giant may have promised to deliver the best AI features, but it certainly fell short of them, as per a new report published by BBB. We’ve been hearing about the Apple Intelligence at last year’s WWDC, but it was not available when the launch occurred in September. Instead, the firm chose to release features in pieces, like October and then December. Even then, it’s still underdelivered as the newest Siri is nowhere to be seen, and no release date is in sight.Several lawsuits are running against Apple for what it says are deceptive AI marketing tactics. The NAD reviewed iPhone 16’s marketing materials and made a conclusion that it was misleading. Now, you can find that the top of Apple’s Intelligence web page is displaying the Available Now banner. They tried to reasonably convey the fact to shoppers about using features immediately after buying a device. These features entail priority notifications like ChatGPT integration, Image Playground, and even Genmoji. The iPhone maker padded claims by adding tiny footnotes and tiny print. These were not clear or visible to everyone, and that’s why Apple is being recommended to avoid passing on messages about features that aren’t on offer.Apple disagrees with the findings of the NAD and mentioned how they need to update the claims, but they are grateful for the chance to work alongside them and would be open to following recommendations.Apple’s claims regarding Siri are speaking about how it’s now present under the Available Now headings and has promised to give users the best voice assistant with great new features. Now, it’s getting rid of the terms Available Now so it doesn’t make the same mistake again. A new video showed the latest offerings and created a lot of hype amongst clients, but that also misled them, as they expected so much but got little to nothing in return. Thankfully, they’ve now pulled the video down, but it’s not fun and games to expect something at premium costs and then be told it does not exist or will come soon. Apple’s final statement on Siri has to do with the features not being up for grabs on the actual timeline and how it updated all promotional materials and altered claims with disclosures to communicate status.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Instagram Launches New Video Editing App Called Edits",

[…] The post Report: Apple Vision Pro Managers Taking Lead of Siri Revamp appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple’s work on Siri will reportedly be led by managers who developed Vision Pro. Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell, who is the new Siri engineering chief, is bringing members of the Vision Pro management team to Siri, replacing or demoting previous managers of the voice assistant business, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (April 22), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s efforts to fix Siri have encountered project delays and engineering problems and have come to symbolize Apple’s difficulties in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, according to the report. While Vision Pro has not been a commercial hit, Rockwell’s leadership of the development of the device showed his ability to take on major projects, gain support from top leadership and produce a well-regarding operating system and product, the report said. Rockwell remains in charge of the Vision Pro operating system, visionOS, even as he leads Siri, per the report. It was reported March 20 that Apple put Rockwell in charge of Siri and removed the voice assistant from the oversight of AI head John Giannadrea in order to speed up the development of AI products. Those leadership changes followed an annual offsite meeting of Apple’s senior leaders, the “Top 100,” at which the company’s AI efforts were a key topic of discussion. Rockwell had demonstrated with the Vision Pro his ability to ship new products, as he became one of the few Apple leaders over the past decade to take a major hardware device from conception to market. Siri was revolutionary when it debuted in 2011 but now lags behind competitors like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android devices, and Samsung’s Galaxy AI — all of which are ahead in incorporating more advanced AI features — PYMNTS reported in March. Luc Julia, a co-designer of the original Siri and now chief scientific officer of French automaker Renault, told PYMNTS in March that one hurdle to moving faster is Apple’s culture, as a product must be “nearly perfect” before it is introduced. “They are falling behind because of this fear of not being perfect,” Julia said.

        "description": "Google and antitrust regulators are facing off in another court hearing.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA judge will likely target Google's search deals with Apple to address its monopoly, experts said.Google and the DOJ are facing off in a court hearing to determine remedies to its search monopoly.As part of its proposed remedies, the DOJ wants the judge to force Google to sell off Chrome.A federal judge will almost certainly target Google's multibillion dollar search engine deals with Apple and other companies as part of a way to remedy the tech empire's illegal online search monopoly, antitrust experts said.On Monday, Google and the Department of Justice began an expected three-week-long court battle in Washington, DC, that could result in a massive shake up of the $1.8 trillion tech behemoth.US District Judge Amit Mehta will ultimately determine Google's fate following the so-called remedies phase of the landmark case. Mehta ruled in August that Google violated US antitrust law in maintaining a monopoly with its online search business.If the DOJ gets its way, Google could be forced to sell off its key Chrome web browser, end its exclusive deals with Apple, Mozilla, Samsung and others to make Google the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones, and share search data with rivals.The DOJ also wants the court to force Google to break off its Android mobile operating system if the search market doesn't experience an increase in competition through its sweeping proposed fixes.Experts in antitrust law told Business Insider that Mehta will most likely rule for Google to end its multibillion dollar deals with companies, including Apple, to be the default search engine on their devices and browsers.Chrome sell off would be 'worst case scenario'\"The judge is almost certainly going to order Google to stop paying for exclusive default status,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a law professor at Tennessee's Vanderbilt University. \"But I don't think we know what exclusive default status means yet.\"Allensworth called it a \"toss up\" on whether the judge will force Google to divest Chrome. Requiring Google to sell off Chrome would be the \"worst case scenario\" for the company, said Allensworth.\"Divestiture remedies are seen as pretty strong medicine,\" Allensworth said, adding that a break up remedy \"isn't very closely related to the behavior at issue in this case.\"No matter what, Allensworth said she believes there will be what's called a behavioral remedy for Google, which would mean the judge will require Google to change how it arranges its contracts with distributors like Apple.\"I think we just don't know exactly how that's going to be designed,\" she said.Additionally, Allensworth said it would be very unlikely that the judge would order Google to divest both Chrome and Android.Back in 2023, when the antitrust case went to trial, it was revealed in court that in 2021 Google paid companies more than $26 billion for the search placement deals. In 2022, Google paid Apple a whopping $20 billion to secure itself as the default search engine on the company's Safari browser, the DOJ said.At trial, the judge made a \"big deal\" about the fact that Google had paid Apple billions, \"saying why would they do so if it didn't lock users in,\" said George Hay, a professor at Cornell Law School and former chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division.\"He clearly believed that the payment had that effect,\" Hay said, adding that eliminating the agreement \"is the most straightforward way to try to set things right.\" The DOJ, he said, will likely argue that's not enough, though.Nicholas Reese, an adjunct professor at New York University, said that Google's exclusivity deals with Apple and other companies \"have been close to the smoking gun for DOJ and other critics because they allegedly show naked attempts to control the market and neutralize competition.\"Reese noted the DOJ \"went big\" in the remedies that it is seeking for Google, but said that getting them all would probably \"surprise\" the government.\"I would stop short of saying we will see every remedy sought by DOJ ordered, but I do believe it will be significant,\" he said.Hay told BI that by asking the judge for as much as it did, the DOJ is \"inviting Google to confirm that something less draconian will work.\"\"Google of course says it wants almost no remedy,\" he said.The judge is expected to issue his remedies ruling by the end of the summer. Google has vowed to appeal Mehta's ruling in which he declared the tech giant a monopolist. It could be years before there's a final outcome.Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh told BI that the more drastic a remedy that gets imposed, \"the more likely it'll get reversed on appeal.\"Google's lawyer called DOJ's proposal a 'wish list' for rivalsIn an opening statement on Monday, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein called the DOJ's proposal of remedies \"a wish list for competitors looking to get the benefits of Google's extraordinary innovations and trade secrets that we've spent decades developing,\" The New York Times reported.Google's vice president for regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said the government's proposal was \"unnecessary and harmful\" in a blog post ahead of the start of the hearing.The DOJ's proposal would make it more difficult for people to use Google search, \"jeopardize\" users' privacy and security, and \"hamstring\" how the company develops AI, Mulholland wrote.Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist said in his opening statement on Monday that the court must prevent Google from using its search monopoly to dominate the AI market.\"This court's remedy should be forward looking and not ignore what's on the horizon,\" Dahlquist said, the Times reported. \"Google is using the same strategy that they did for search and now applying it\" to its Gemini AI chatbot.Google's lawyer argued that Gemini rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT, is doing just fine.Read the original article on Business Insider Google and antitrust regulators are facing off in another court hearing.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA judge will likely target Google's search deals with Apple to address its monopoly, experts said.Google and the DOJ are facing off in a court hearing to determine remedies to its search monopoly.As part of its proposed remedies, the DOJ wants the judge to force Google to sell off Chrome.A federal judge will almost certainly target Google's multibillion dollar search engine deals with Apple and other companies as part of a way to remedy the tech empire's illegal online search monopoly, antitrust experts said.On Monday, Google and the Department of Justice began an expected three-week-long court battle in Washington, DC, that could result in a massive shake up of the $1.8 trillion tech behemoth.US District Judge Amit Mehta will ultimately determine Google's fate following the so-called remedies phase of the landmark case.

Consumers’ perception of Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) platform is more favorable than that of investors, Morgan Stanley said in a research note released Tuesday (April 22). In the note, which the company provided to PYMNTS, Morgan Stanley said it found that the Apple Intelligence platform has been downloaded and engaged with by 80% of eligible U.S. iPhone owners in the last six months, has an above average net promoter score of 53, and is characterized by iPhone users as “easy to use, innovative, and something that improves their user experience.” “While much of the public critique of Apple Intelligence is warranted, and investor sentiment and expectations on Apple’s AI platform couldn’t be lower, our survey of iPhone owners paints a more positive picture,” Morgan Stanley said in the note. The survey also found that since September, the share of iPhone owners who believe it is extremely or very important to have Apple Intelligence support on their next iPhone rose 15 points to reach 42%. Among iPhone owners who are likely to upgrade their device in the next 12 months, the percentage saying that about the AI platform rose 20 points to reach 54%, according to the note. Morgan Stanley also found that consumers are willing to pay more for Apple Intelligence than they were in September. Those who have used the AI platform are now willing to pay an average of $9.11 per month for it, a figure that’s 11% higher than the $8.17 average seen in September, per the note. “While we don’t expect Apple to put Apple Intelligence behind a paywall until the platform is more built out, the potential long-term monetization of an Apple Intelligence subscription could reach tens of billions of dollars annually when considering a 1.4B global iPhone installed base, 32% (and growing) of US iPhone owners have an Apple Intelligence support iPhone, and users are willing to pay up to $9.11/month for Apple Intelligence,” Morgan Stanley said in the note. Apple announced its suite of AI features in June, saying Apple Intelligence would revolutionize the iPhone,Mac and iPad experience, while keeping user data safe. The rollout of the offering over a period of months experienced some hiccups, including complaints that its AI summary tool was generating inaccurate headlines, leading Apple to remove the feature from its operating system.

        "description": "For decades, huge swaths of Brazil’s Cerrado ecosystem have been used to support the global demand for burgers. Forests and grasslands were replaced by pastures along with farms growing soy to feed cattle. But a major restoration project is now underway on an area nearly twice as large as Manhattan. If you fly over one part of southwestern Brazil, you’ll see a patchwork of dozens of square plots where a local university is studying different methods of helping native plants regrow on former cattle pastures. On more than 25,000 acres, along rivers and the edge of remaining pieces of forest, new vegetation has been growing quickly over the past two years. Wildlife cameras track the native species that are returning, from puma to an endangered species of rabbit. The environmental group Conservation International is working on the project with an unlikely set of partners: a forestry company and the tech giant Apple. [Photo: TIG] Why Apple is investing in forests The project is one piece of Apple’s climate strategy. “When we look at the global climate science, it’s clear that we have to cut emissions as quickly as possible, but we also have to end deforestation and rapidly scale up carbon removal in order to stay within 1.5 degrees [of global temperature rise],” says Chris Busch, director of environmental initiatives at Apple. The company’s first priority is reducing its own emissions. Through tactics like using recycled rare earth elements in iPhones and helping suppliers shift to renewable energy at factories, it has already cut its emissions by 60% compared to 2015. By 2030, it’s aiming to hit 75%. But for the remaining 25%, Busch says, “We just don’t have a clear line of sight to how to avoid those emissions at scale today within our value chain. So that is where nature comes in to play a role for us.” There are several ways to take CO2 out of the atmosphere, including nascent technology like direct air capture. But Apple knew that in order to reach its short-term goals for 2030, it would need to lean on nature’s ability to capture carbon because no other approach was ready to scale up quickly enough. At the same time, the company recognized that there weren’t enough nature-based carbon credits available to buy—and restoration and preservation projects often struggle to prove that they actually have as much benefit as they claim. In 2021, Apple committed $200 million to the Restore Fund, a new fund established with Conservational International and Goldman Sachs, to help carbon removal grow more quickly and to focus on creating quality projects. (In 2023, it pledged an additional $200 million for a second fund within the program.) One of the first investments, in 2022, was Project Alpha in Brazil. Restoration and planting started in 2023. It’s the first step in a larger effort that will eventually restore 741,000 acres of degraded land across Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. A biodiversity hot spot The Cerrado ecosystem, which originally sprawled over more than a million square miles in Brazil with a mix of dense forests, grasslands, and wetlands, is a biodiversity hot spot. Many of its 1,600-plus species of animals, and 10,000 species of plants, can’t be found anywhere else. It’s also quickly disappearing. “It’s faced a rate of loss that’s fairly extreme,” says Will Turner, senior vice president at Conservation International’s Center for Natural Climate Solutions. “Well over half of the native Cerrado vegetation has been destroyed, predominantly due to agriculture.” The restoration project is focusing on an area that was converted for grazing in the 1990s, and bought the land from cattle farmers. As grasslands were replaced by pasture, they were planted with invasive grasses to feed cattle. The grass chokes off the growth of native plants. Because it’s spread so much, the non-native grass makes restoration expensive and challenging. That’s why the project took a new approach: Instead of focusing solely on restoration, it’s happening in combination with carefully managed forestry. [Photo: TIG] Why an environmental group wanted to partner with a forestry company BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (TIG), the forestry partner on the project, is planting tree farms on half of the former grazing land, and managing restoration on the other half. In some ways, the solution seems counterintuitive: The tree farms will grow eucalyptus, a non-native species from Australia. In other parts of Brazil, environmental groups have derided eucalyptus plantations, arguing that they’re destructive. But the trees can thrive in degraded soil where other species struggle to grow. They also grow quickly, taking up large amounts of CO2. Since deforestation reduces rainfall, planting new trees can also help with the hydrological cycle. And as global demand for wood continues to grow, the new plantations—which are FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified—can potentially help avoid deforestation of native trees in places like the Amazon rainforest. Some critics argue that eucalyptus overuses groundwater, but Conservation International says that’s often caused by poor management. If a eucalyptus plantation is managed well, the nonprofit says, recent research suggests it will use the same amount of water as a native forest. (The forestry company is also screening out locations that have insufficient water availability and monitoring water security for others in the area.) When TIG bought grazing land from farmers, it carefully tracked where the cattle were moved, making sure that the process didn’t lead to new land being cleared elsewhere. (The company agreed to this, along with other sustainability critera, as part of the project.) Then, with guidance from Conservation International, it began “assisted natural regeneration,” taking steps to help native vegetation regrow. In some areas, it’s also planting seeds or seedlings. Having the forestry company on the site also means that its crew can protect the restored areas from encroachment from other farmers or fight wildfires if needed. The forestry company will earn carbon credits both as its trees capture CO2 and as native vegetation is being restored. Apple also has a stake in the project. “What we’re aiming to do is generate a financial return as an investor in those projects, but also a carbon return,” says Busch. “Part of the return that we get on that investment is carbon credits.” Third-party auditors will monitor the project before the carbon credits are issued. Apple is also helping with some of the monitoring technology, including testing ways to use the iPhone’s lidar scanner to measure the diameter of trees. Without the forestry part of the project in place, Conservation International says it’s unlikely that any restoration would have happened in the area at all. Including forestry makes the restoration financially viable. And it helped it happen at a large scale: The project will increase the restoration across the entire Cerrado region by 50%. “At the end of the day, what we think is really important is figuring out how to get to scale in terms of restoration and carbon sequestration quickly,” says Apple’s Busch. “That needs to be funded somehow. The conservation side of the operation is truly [financially] sustainable because it can be funded by the business side.”",

        "description": "New stats published by the IDC are speaking out about Chinese smartphone sales in Q1 of this year. Sadly, all companies except for Apple are doing great.This is another added pressure on Apple China as their problems keep mounting, especially thanks to the ongoing trade war between America and China, thanks to Trump. Remember, most of Apple’s products are produced in China, and seeing iPhone sales drop tremendously is a serious issue. Many experts feel that the high selling price, no AI, and the subsidy program might be some of the factors causing the outcome. The fact that Apple is the only tech giant whose sales keep falling YoY says so much. To be more exact, the company stood fifth in shipments as well as market share. It was also the only firm in the top five where sales were declining. That’s alarming considering the market is ready to buy other archrivals like Huawei and Xiaomi, but not Apple. In fact, both smartphone giants saw growth in sales by double digits, while Apple continues to lose.If you’re wondering what the reason for this decline could be, the answer is simple. There isn’t any Apple Intelligence that was supposed to make products stand out. The growth during the first quarter kept on giving market leaders a better position to deal with any issues during the other parts of the year. Xiaomi stands out as it managed to retain its top spot after almost 10 years. Apple keeps falling on the list as the premium pricing stops it from making the most of subsidies.China did offer plenty of subsidies so buyers could make more smartphone purchases. However, those subsidies apply to smartphones in the low and mid-range. Now, the iPhone 16 might qualify, but the more trending 16 Pro lineup is very costly for clients to benefit from. Strained relations between America and China aren’t helping and keep showing up as challenges that Apple fails to overcome.Now the question is if the iPhone maker can really turn its fate around in China and bring up iPhone sales anytime soon. It looks like only time can tell, and we’ll keep you updated on that front.

        "description": "If real Easter eggs aren’t your thing this weekend, you may find hunting for digital ones more enjoyable. And there are some cool ones to find at your fingertips, provided you have an iPhone or Mac. Apple has packed the iOS and macOS operating systems with several fun little references, many harking back to the legacy of the company or other companies in the tech industry. Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death This one’s been around for a while, and it’s a fan favorite. The Finder on your Mac can show other computers connected to the same network. These computers are represented by icons. If the connected computers are other Macs, you’ll see icons that accurately represent the shape of the computer, such as a modern MacBook Pro or even an old G4 iMac from the early 2000s. But if the connected computers are Windows PCs, you’ll see the same icon for them all: an ugly beige CRT monitor with the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death—the screen PC users see when something has gone seriously wrong with the Windows operating system. The icon choice is Apple’s subtle dig at its once archnemesis, and it has been an Easter egg in the Mac’s operating systems for a few decades now. iPhone Voice Memo app icon In this case, the Easter egg is an iPhone app icon itself. The waveform in the Voice Memos app icon may not be just a random glyph. Instead, SiliconRepublic says, the waveform’s shape is the one you get when you use Voice Memos to record the word “Apple.” In my tests, it’s pretty accurate, but your mileage may vary depending on how you enunciate words. Safari Reading List icon Apple has snuck a few direct references to Steve Jobs in its operating systems. The first can be found in the Safari app on iPhone. Open up Safari and then tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen. See the “Reading List” icon in the center of the pop-up? Those are a pair of eyeglasses—but not just any. They look remarkably identical to the round spectacles Steve Jobs made iconic. Record label with Steve Jobs’s phrases There’s another reported Steve Jobs reference in Apple’s software. This one is in macOS. If you open the System Settings app, click Users & Groups, and then click on your profile picture to edit it, you’ll notice that under the “Suggestions” folder full of icons, you can select an icon of a record turntable. Well, if you go to where the icon image file is actually stored in macOS (Macintosh HD>Library>User Pictures>Instruments) and open the “Turntable.heic” file, you’ll see the record on the turntable lists four tracks on its label: “1. Magic 2. Revolution 3. Boom! 4. Unbelievable.” These were all words Jobs frequently exclaimed during his keynote speeches and demos, notes iDropNews. “Here’s to the crazy ones” Next to its seminal “1984” ad, Apple’s most iconic campaign was probably “Think Different”, from the late 1990s. That campaign features a poem called “Here’s to the crazy ones.” Apple has commemorated that poem in two places in its operating systems. The first is in the System Settings app in macOS. Click on the Display preferences panel, and you’ll notice the text size adjustment icons display the opening text from the poem. “Here’s to the crazy ones” can also be found printed on the pages of the open book emoji found in iOS and macOS. Let It Snow (in the Apple Store app) Finally, back in 2021, Apple snuck a little Easter egg into its Apple Store app for iPhone, noted AppleInsider. If you type in “let it snow” in the search field of the Apple Store app, the app will then display digital falling snow across your screen. While this Easter egg isn’t a direct reference to Apple, it’s a fun one to trigger during the winter holidays. A history of Apple Easter eggs During my research for this story, I consulted several older Apple Easter egg roundups—such as the ones published by iDropNews, MacRumors, and Mental Floss—to make sure that I had forgotten any big ones. I discovered that Apple has actually removed a fair amount of them from its operating systems. These removals include former Easter eggs that allowed you to play Tetris in the Terminal app or watch Star Wars reenacted in ASCII. There also used to be a Bitcoin Easter egg in macOS, but Apple has now removed that, too. I also remember from back in the day that when you typed “evil empire” into the OS X Dictionary app, you would find the entry for Microsoft. But that seems to be gone from macOS now, too. In other words, it seems like Apple has been cracking down on Easter eggs in recent years, so enjoy the above while you can.",

        "description": "If you thought you’d heard the last of the viral “Apple” dance, think again. The TikToker behind it is now suing Roblox over its unauthorized use. Last year, during the height of Brat summer, Roblox partnered with singer Charli XCX to feature her music and likeness in an in-game concert within “Dress to Impress,” a fashion game on the platform. In a lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles, Kelley Heyer—the creator of the dance set to Charli XCX’s hit song—alleges that Roblox used her choreography in the update before finalizing negotiations to officially license the dance, as first reported by Polygon. Heyer first posted the “Apple” dance on June 15, 2024, and submitted a copyright application on August 30. That was after Roblox reached out to her about licensing the dance as an emote for players to purchase. Roblox added the dance emote, an in-game action used to express a character’s personality, in mid-August to coincide with the update. According to the lawsuit, Heyer expressed her willingness to license the dance on August 12, but alleges that Roblox has “refused to finalize a license agreement” and that she has received no compensation for the use of her choreography. Roblox removed the emote from the game in November 2024—but not before it was sold over 60,000 times, earning an estimated $123,000 from the copyrighted work, per the lawsuit. Heyer hasn’t seen any of that revenue, and since the dance is entirely separate from the Charli XCX song, she’s suing to claim her share (Charli XCX is not named in the lawsuit). “Roblox moved forward using Kelley’s IP without a signed agreement,” attorney Miki Anzai said in a statement to Polygon. “Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement.” Roblox has since responded. A spokesperson told Polygon: “As a platform powered by a community of creators, Roblox takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform.” They continued: “Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court.”",

        "description": "Today, Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV Plus, has done something unheard of in streaming television. The company has now re-released the final episode of the canceled sitcom Mythic Quest with a new, re-edited ending. The re-edit removes the original season cliffhanger and replaces it with a new ending that acts to resolve the show’s lingering plot point, thus wrapping up the series by giving the show’s supporters, and characters, closure. But while the re-edit may please fans, it raises some interesting issues concerning the entertainment historical record. A first in TV streaming On March 26, Apple TV Plus released the 10th episode of Mythic Quest season four. Titled “Heaven and Hell,” this episode was initially designed to be the season’s finale, and, as most season finales do, it ended on a cliffhanger. However, after the season finale aired, Apple announced that it was canceling Mythic Quest. With no season five, the show’s cancellation meant that the series ended on a cliffhanger that would never be resolved—just like so many streaming series that were canceled before it. But then Apple did something unexpected and unheard of in the world of streaming television. It allowed Mythic Quest’s producers to go back and re-edit the season four finale by swapping out the cliffhanger ending for one that better aligns with a series finale—in other words, one that wraps up the show’s loose threads. Mythic Quest’s creators and executive producers, Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney, announced the unusual move last week, stating, “Because endings are hard, with Apple’s blessing we made one final update to our last episode—so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.” And now, the re-edited Mythic Quest episode is available. How the original and re-edited endings are different If you navigate to the Mythic Quest listing on Apple TV Plus now, you’ll see that the episode shows a new original air date of April 18, 2025, signaling that Apple has now released the re-edit. As the entertainment website Pajiba points out, the re-edited episode features a relatively small change. In the original episode, the show’s two main characters, Ian and Poppy, who have always had a platonic and professional work relationship throughout the show’s run, kissed. The repercussions of that cliffhanger kiss ending were originally meant to be fully explored in Mythic Quest’s season five. Yet the re-edited episode now removes the kiss ending entirely. As Pajiba notes, “It’s the same episode, only this time, the two agree to repair their working relationship, but it remains platonic. They hug, and that’s it.” It’s likely that since work had already ceased on the series, this new hugging scene had already been previously shot, which is what allowed the creatives to alter the episode so quickly within just weeks of its original release. Altering the historical record While fans of the show will no doubt be grateful that Apple gave the creatives permission to go back and change the final “Heaven and Hell” episode to provide closure for them the show’s characters, how Apple has handled it is worth pointing out. There are television shows that have been canceled before that were later brought back on a new network or revived on streaming, but never, to my knowledge, has there been a show that has had its last episode aired before cancellation, changed, and then re-released. But it seems like Apple has chosen to go about its fan-pleasing move by not caring too much about the entertainment historical record. That’s because there is nothing left on Apple TV Plus’ platform that suggests the “Heaven and Hell” episode available now is anything but the one that originally aired. Mythic Quest’s season four finale has now been relabeled as the “Series Finale” in Apple TV Plus’s show listing. Apple has chosen to make only the re-edited version of the show available to watch. (We’ve reached out to Apple to ask if it plans to also release the original version at some point.) Furthermore, its original release date has also been changed from March 26 to April 18, 2025. It is also not mentioned anywhere in the episode that the episode has been re-edited from its original version—nor is there an option to view the original ending. In other words, it seems like Apple has taken the George Lucas approach to changing the historical entertainment record. In the late 1990s, Lucas released a version of the original Star Wars trilogy with new scenes and effects inserted. Lucasfilm then essentially wiped the trilogy as it originally was from existence. To this day, Lucasfilm (and now its owner, Disney) only makes the re-edited version of the Star Wars trilogy available for consumption. When it comes to a less culturally relevant show like Mythic Quest (compared to Star Wars), is this that big of a deal? Probably not—at least not to general streaming subscribers. But the wiping of the original episode highlights how, in this digital world of ours, anything can be altered at any time—and the original may not always be preserved for posterity.",

For years, Apple has played the role of the bystander in advertising — wealthy, capable and largely disinterested. It had the reach, the hardware, the data, the closed loop ecosystem, it had everything but the need. Now, that’s starting to change. Apple’s quiet rebrand of its search ads business to the more assertive “Apple Ads” may seem like a modest semantic update but in the context of platform power plays, language rarely shifts without intention. The move suggests that Apple is no longer content to just collect rent from the ad tech ecosystem it reshaped through privacy policies. It wants a larger piece of the action.

Even if tariffs did cause the iPhone’s price to surge, we would have plenty of cheaper options, like buying last year’s phone model instead of the latest and greatest. The most important lesson we can learn from the turmoil: The only consistent way to save money on tech is to use devices for as long as possible, which requires maintaining them as you would a car, and upgrading only when you must. This whole angle is no surprise coming from the tech columnist whose advice to readers who think their aging phone cameras don’t perform well in low light is “Just use flash.” If phone prices go up because of Trump’s tariffs, all phone prices are going to go up, including those for older models, whether you’re buying new or used. There is no silver lining here. Spending more to get a years-old phone sucks too. Take the iPhone 16 as an example. Its $800 price tag can easily inflate to $1,080, since you may also buy: An iPhone case for $50 AirPods for $130 256 gigabytes of storage for $100 So if you buy things that aren’t an iPhone — like AirPods — the price of an iPhone goes up. Got it. The anti-“big tech” bias here is so obvious.

        "description": "The world’s biggest tech players are racing against time to slash their carbon emissions to zero. Apple has made significant strides, claiming over half of its goal is already achieved. Since 2015, the tech giant has cut its emissions by roughly 60%, covering everything from manufacturing to customer use.While many companies have reduced their direct emissions, aided by affordable renewable energy, the challenge intensifies when it comes to Scope 3 emissions. These are emissions from suppliers and customers, outside the company’s direct influence.Apple is leading innovation in tackling these harder-to-control emissions. For instance, alongside the launch of the Apple Watch Series 9, it announced plans to purchase renewable energy on behalf of its customers. The same initiative extended to buyers of the M4 Mac mini the following year.The Mac mini release also drew attention to the significant carbon footprint of semiconductors in electronics. The base model, with modest RAM and storage, results in 32 kg of carbon emissions throughout its life cycle. The more advanced version, with greater memory and storage, reaches 121 kg, (almost four times as much) due to the additional chips.Apple has been collaborating with semiconductor suppliers to address this issue. So far, 26 suppliers have committed to reducing fluorinated greenhouse gases by 90%. These gases are crucial for chip production but are among the most harmful to the environment, with some compounds warming the planet nearly 10,000 times more than CO2.Apple has set an ambitious goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 75% by 2030, with five years remaining. The remaining 25% will be offset through carbon removal programs, which is a common strategy for companies facing similar challenges. Microsoft, for example, is investing in technology like direct air capture, while Apple favors nature-based solutions such as reforestation for their immediate benefits.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: The App That Dances Now Debates: TikTok’s New Feature Isn't for Entertainment",

        "description": "According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse Early Look, the global smartphone market has grown by 3% in Q1 2025. Even though there was some decline seen in developed markets, China saw some growth mostly because of government subsidies. Emerging markets like Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East also saw some recovery in their global smartphone market in Q1 2025. Ankit Malhotra, the senior research analyst at Counterpoint Research, said that mixed results were seen in 2025, with emerging markets showing better results because of better economic conditions and mature markets slowing down after recovering in 2024. Global smartphone sales were strong in January because of subsidies in China and the release of the iPhone 16e and Samsung S25. But this momentum slowed down by the end of the quarter because of trade war risks and economic uncertainties. Overall, the market is predicted to decline YoY by 2025. Q1 of 2025 saw interesting competition among OEMs, with Apple being at the top spot mostly because of the launch of the iPhone 16e. Even though there were declining or flat sales in markets like Europe, the US, and China, there was double-digit growth of Apple in markets like the Middle East & Africa, Japan, Southeast Asia, and India. The second top OEM was Samsung, with 18% of the market share. Even though Samsung sales slowed down at the beginning of the quarter, they picked up in March after the S25 series was launched. Xiaomi took the third spot and overall had strong momentum and good market share. It is also slowly growing in the premium segment, and its brand image has been boosted in China mostly due to its entry into electric vehicles.The fastest growing brand among the top five smartphone brands was vivo, coming at number four, because of its growth in emerging markets and China and strong performance. It was followed by OPPO, which had good sales in Latin America, India, and Europe. Outside the top five, Huawei, HONOR, and Motorola are also growing fast and will probably have tough competition globally soon. Huawei took the number one spot as top selling brand in China in Q1 while HONOR and Motorola also saw growth in various markets. 2023 was tough but now the condition of the global smartphone market is improving because of better economic conditions, but it is still expected to decline by the end of 2025.

        "description": "Last week, Apple announced it would cancel one of the first shows that it had ever green lit for its Apple TV Plus streaming service: Mythic Quest, a show that first launched on the tech giant’s then-fledgling streaming service in February 2020. The show, which followed the escapades of an MMORPG video game developer, was axed after the last episode of its fourth season, which aired on March 26. Like many season finales, the last episode of Mythic Quest ended on a cliffhanger, so when viewers learned of its cancellation, they assumed that they would never get any resolution to the storyline and characters that they had followed for four seasons. Yet then Apple did something unexpected: It allowed the show producers to reedit the season four ending to give closure to the storyline—and fans. Streaming TV is littered with unresolved cliffhangers If there’s one thing subscribers to streaming services have come to accept, it’s that they shouldn’t get too connected to a new series. Why? Because you never know if the streamer is going to ax it after just a season or two. One streamer in particular—Netflix—is notorious for doing this. The streaming giant will often premiere new series to see what sticks with audiences. But even if those series are critically and commercially well-received, that’s no guarantee that viewership will be high enough to clear whatever bar Netflix uses to justify a next season. Often, it isn’t—and this has left a slew of abruptly canceled shows that ended on cliffhangers and left fans unsure of how things would have ended. Such shows include the critically acclaimed zombie series Black Summer, the horror series Archive 81, the sitcom Space Force, and the science fiction show 1899, just to name a few. All had seasons that ended on major cliffhangers—only for the series to be canceled shortly after. To be fair, Netflix isn’t the only streamer that does this. HBO Max and Amazon Prime are guilty of this, too. And, of course, before the world of streaming, network television was also guilty of canceling shows on cliffhangers, though not to the degree that streamers appear to be willing to do it. Historically, networks were always more generous with giving shows the time they needed to find an audience—even if that took three or four seasons. But what is unheard of is a streamer allowing the creatives of a canceled series to go back and reedit the already-aired last episode so that the show and its fans can have some proper closure. Yet that’s precisely what Apple has now done. ‘Mythic Quest’ fans get closure Last Friday, Mythic Quest’s creators and executive producers, Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney, announced that Apple has given them permission to reedit the original season four cliffhanger to provide closure to the storyline, characters, and fans. “Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, Mythic Quest is coming to a close. We’re so proud of the show and the world we got to build—and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning,” the trio said in a statement (via Deadline). David Hornsby, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Imani Hakim, and Ashly Burch in the season four finale of “Mythic Quest” [Photo: Apple TV+] But they continued: “Because endings are hard, with Apple’s blessing we made one final update to our last episode—so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.” That “final update” to the show’s last episode is a reedit of the series four finale, titled “Heaven and Hell.” At this time, it is unknown how significantly the final episode has been reedited, but it will be released on Apple TV Plus later this week. Probably not a sign of things to come While fans of the show will no doubt be happy that at least they will get some closure to the storyline and characters that they have followed for years, it’s unlikely that Apple’s move represents the beginning of a seismic shift in the streaming industry. It’s not known why Apple has decided to allow the show’s creators to go back and edit the last episode—or what the terms of the deal were. Mythic Quest’s creators’ statement suggests that no new scenes were shot, and instead, they accomplished the reedit simply by using existing footage they had already shot. Fast Company has reached out to Apple for comment. But realistically, we probably shouldn’t expect other streamers to follow suit. Streaming services cancel dozens of shows each year, and most shows that suddenly get canceled likely wouldn’t have enough unused footage to reedit a final cliffhanger episode into something that provides a cohesive amount of closure. It’s also unlikely that a streamer would be willing to pay for the creatives and star to go back out to shoot new footage to provide such closure, given that they’ve already canceled the show and thus didn’t see the value in it to their bottom line. However, what will be interesting to see is how Apple handles the reedited episode. It is unknown whether Apple will keep the originally streamed season four finale on Apple TV Plus alongside the new edit of the episode or simply remove the original entirely. Either way, fans of Mythic Quest will be happy that the show is getting the concrete ending that all shows deserve.",

You'd be wrong. They love it — though they might have some notes.Four Hollywood insiders told Business Insider they felt the show was positive for the branded entertainment business because the series legitimized the concept by poking fun at it.Jae Goodman, whose Superconnector Studios is working with the likes of LVMH and AB InBev to break into Hollywood, said he's already had a couple of directly correlated incoming calls from people in the wake of the show, asking: \"Should we be thinking about this?\"The first episode of \"The Studio\" centers on Seth Rogen's character Matt Remick, a film purist, getting promoted to be the head of the fictional Continental Studios. The catch? He only gets the job after promising his boss, played by Bryan Cranston, that he'll make a movie based on the Kool-Aid brand. In the episode, Remick initially snubs filmmaker Nick Stoller's (\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" \"Captain Underpants\") commercial adaptation to work with Martin Scorsese, who wants to make his dream film about the Jonestown massacre. Hilarity ensues.\"Even if it's done in an over-the-top way, it's highlighting the state of storytelling in Hollywood right now,\" said Brad Roth, president of Known Originals, which worked with Toys \"R\" Us and Fox Studios for a competition reality series, \"Family Faceoff,\" and is now working with The Knot on a slate of TV shows and films.Martin Scorsese is pulled into the Kool-Aid storyline in \"The Studio.\"Apple TV+What the show gets right about branded entertainmentOne immediately recognizable scene is the studio's hopes of repeating the success of \"Barbie.\" 2023's Barbie blockbuster movie is the ultimate in brand films, earning critical praise, winning an Oscar, and topping the list of highest-grossing pictures.\"Hollywood is Hollywood, and if something works, they want to keep it going as long as they can,\" said Angela Matusik, who consults with brands on entertainment strategies.Episode one's resolution — in which Remick ultimately throws Scorsese under the bus and goes with Stoller's more commercial pitch — also rang true to insiders.While Kool-Aid executives aren't portrayed in the show, Remick's actions speak to the compromises required to bring these kinds of projects to fruition, which people who work at the intersection of brands and entertainment know all too well. And as much as Remick was wedded to the auteur version of the film, the Stoller one would probably be better, Known's Roth said.\"It is such a pop culture icon that feels more aligned with Nick's take,\" he said. \"It may not get into the pantheon of great films, but it probably is the right take.\"\"The Studio\" also shows that, ultimately, there's a great and awful way to execute any idea, said Marc Gilbar, president of Imagine Brands, IP & Partnership at Imagine Entertainment, who's led award-winning films for brands including Nike, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble.\"If you told someone there was a movie in development about Facebook, Nike, Barbie, Lego, they would be pretty skeptical, but then again, with David Fincher, Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig, or Lord and Miller behind them, those all become great movies,\" he said.What the show leaves outSo, what did \"The Studio\" get wrong?For one, insiders said the nitty-gritty of getting all the stakeholders aligned to make a brand film is more nuanced than its portrayal in \"The Studio.\"The show also depicts brands as thirsty to get in bed with Hollywood. While it's true to some extent — Mattel has other films in the works based on toys like Uno — in reality, brands aren't just a blank check, as some studios and producers think.\"They think this is a big white horse that's going to ride in and save the film industry,\" Matusik said.In uncertain economic times like today's, marketers tend to turn away from formats like films that will come out when the world may be a much different place, in favor of ad formats that promise a quick payoff.The show got people talking about Kool-AidOne big question people had: How much did Kool-Aid know, and when did they know it?Sometimes movies and shows are made about brands without their involvement, as was the case with 2023's \"Air\" about the origin of Air Jordans. It was made independently of Nike.In the case of \"The Studio,\" which pointedly recalls Kool-Aid's association with an episode of mass death, it's hard to imagine the brand played an active role.A spokesperson for parent Kraft Heinz said the brand got a heads-up when the show was filmed and about to air and that while it \"was not given the opportunity\" to be involved in developing the show, its inclusion speaks to its strong cultural relevance. The rep added that Kool-Aid \"would love to find a way to collaborate with them in the future.\"Despite the prominent Jonestown reference, brand entertainment insiders said they felt Kool-Aid's starring role in multiple episodes was a triumph.\"To be in this funny show, that's such a great win for the brand,\" Roth said. \"I haven't talked about Kool-Aid since I was 12 years old. Everyone who's watching that show is talking about Kool-Aid.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Seth Rogen plays an embattled film exec in Apple TV+'s \"The Studio.\"Apple TV+Apple TV+'s \"The Studio\" satirizes Hollywood's art-commerce tension.The Seth Rogen show parodies brand films and nods to real-life successes like \"Barbie.\"Insiders say its portrayal of branded entertainment is positive for the industry despite the jokes.Warning: Minor spoilers for \"The Studio\" episode one.Apple TV+'s buzzy new satire, \"The Studio,\" skewers Hollywood's recent embrace of brands with a prominent storyline about a \"Kool-Aid\" movie.You might think the real-life people who make brand-backed films and TV shows would be miffed.

        "description": "A new report by Mark Gurman at Bloomberg is shedding light on Apple’s latest plans for AI. This has to do with carrying out measures that are in line with the company’s privacy-first model, but at the same time, ensure it can collect real-world snippets without sending data back to servers. This might be in the form of emails stored inside models like Mac computers, iPads, and iPhones.The iPhone maker shared more on this front, including how the goal is to produce synthetic data that’s as close as possible to the real thing. This can assist models in generating summaries, but it’s done without actually collecting the data from a certain device.The company’s entire AI platform is called Apple Intelligence, and we’ve seen it lag behind other AI giants in the industry, such as OpenAI, Google, and even Microsoft. A major reason is linked to how the company was working on designing AI tools that didn’t really make use of real-time users’ information, as it was against its privacy practices. After all, who wants to engage in another battle about privacy, right? The issue with that was that most information didn’t really feel like actual interactions from users, and that produced poor results.The company’s tools for writing and generating summaries haven’t been getting a lot of rave reviews. Many of the alerts don’t make sense. Quite a few summaries aren’t on the right mark, and Siri has its own issues where it continues to fail at the one job that it’s supposed to do.The whole matter could spark a major shake-up, leading to delays in the release timelines and giving off the aura that it’s just not ready to tackle the world of AI yet. At this moment, the latest system wants to lessen the clutter and get the AI job done seamlessly. So what better way than to train models with data that’s as close to the real deal as possible?The goal here appears to be linked to Apple peeking into emails, without actually storing or reading. This can better calibrate the synthetic data for training, provide better message summaries, and enhance suggestions for writing. Obviously, the changes would be applicable to all users who opt into this through analytics and settings for product betterment.

AppleCare+ is $13.99 a month or $139.99 annually — cheaper than a brand-new iPhone.You can also do it yourselfFor the more technically advanced users, Apple launched its self-service repair program in 2022. It provides the correct tools and parts for iPhone owners to repair their devices at home. A kit for replacing the back glass of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, for example, costs $199. You'll get a return credit for shipping back the glass you replaced.Phones running on iOS 18 have access to the Repair Assistant feature, which can recognize authentic Apple parts and ensure they're working properly if you're doing your own repair job.And, if you're ready to make the change, you could trade in your depleted phone for a possible discount on a new one.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "U.S. tech giants are awkwardly navigating two paths through the minefield of President Trump's global trade war.The big picture: Companies like Apple and Nvidia are altering their short-term supply chains and diversifying their product sourcing to minimize the cost of Trump's tariffs.At the same time, they're doing everything they can to get on Trump's good side, hoping it will pay off in carve-outs or other favors.Driving the news: Nvidia said on Monday it will begin making some of its AI chips at TSMC's Arizona plant and will also start making \"AI supercomputers\" in the U.S. Nvidia also said it will aim, along with its partners, to spend $500 billion on domestic U.S. AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang reportedly attended a $1 million-per-person dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week — and shortly after, per NPR, the White House shelved planned new restrictions on Nvidia's chip exports to China.Apple has also been seeking to dodge the tariffs' blows. The company has reportedly flown planeloads of iPhones to the U.S. in hopes of beating tariffs, delaying potential price increases or profit hits. Apple is also reportedly encouraging all its non-Chinese manufacturing operations to make as many devices as possible. At the same time, CEO Tim Cook's efforts to placate Trump seemed to bear some fruit when the White House announced Friday the new tariffs would not apply to smartphones and electronics. That felt like a repeat from Trump's first term, when Cook won a tariff exemption for the iPhone.But by Sunday, Apple's reprieve looked like it could be short-lived, with Trump warning that \"NOBODY is getting off the hook.\"Catch up quick: Tech companies began efforts to diversify their production beyond China during the first Trump administration, and those efforts expanded after the pandemic. Much of that production moved to countries like Vietnam and India that are also targets of Trump's now-paused reciprocal tariffs. State of play: For tech's biggest firms, the game of Trump management involves rituals of appeasement in the form of public announcements of extravagant — and ostensibly new — investments. The game has four rules.Pick a crazy high investment number in the hundreds of billions of dollars, then hedge it by using terms like \"up to\" and \"planned.\"Roll together projects that were already in the pipeline with new spending plans to boost the final tally. Be sure to credit Trump by name, or otherwise signal he made the deals possible, or just don't contradict him when he takes credit.In a few months or years, feel free to change course or back out as needed.Microsoft and OpenAI have also played this game since Trump returned to office, announcing splashy investments of their own.Between the lines: Tariffs hit some tech giants much harder than others.Tariffs affect physical goods shipped by boat or plane. So companies like Apple and Nvidia that deal in hardware have a lot more at stake than software-and-services companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta. But if tariffs bring on an economic slowdown or recession, every firm would feel the pain.What's next: Industry watchers will keep a close eye on what companies actually spend on the ground over time.Many outsize commitments that companies made to domestic manufacturing during Trump's first term — like a much ballyhooed Foxconn project in Wisconsin — either never materialized or got radically downsized.

Apple is planning to analyze user data to improve its large language model (LLM) software while upholding user privacy. The company has been using synthetic data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models but has found that method to be ineffective, Apple wrote in a Monday (April 14) blog post. Now, Apple will still use synthetic data as a starting point but will compare the generated text to a sample of emails from participating user to determine which generated output best lines up with real-world messages. “Only users who have opted-in to send Device Analytics information to Apple participate,” Apple said in the blog post. “The contents of the sampled emails never leave the device and are never shared with Apple. A participating device will send only a signal indicating which of the variants is closest to the sampled data on the device, and Apple learns which selected synthetic emails are most often selected across all devices.” The new technique aims to improve text-related features from the Apple Intelligence platform, like summaries in notifications, the ability to synthesize thoughts in its Writing Tools and recaps of user messages. Apple Intelligence has struggled to provide users with accurate summaries, and senior executives said in an internal meeting last month that the company’s delays to key updates for Siri, its virtual AI-powered voice assistant, have been ugly and embarrassing. Apple said Siri would get fresh AI updates later this year, but the Big Tech firm later told Reuters that those improvements would only come in 2026. Siri, once a pioneer in the field of virtual assistants, is now lagging behind rivals such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android devices, and Samsung’s Galaxy AI, all of which are ahead in offering more advanced AI features, PYMNTS reported last month. The delays reportedly resulted in the termination of an executive, a rare move for Apple. CEO Tim Cook removed AI head John Giannandrea, the former head of search and AI at Google, from overseeing Siri. Taking his place, Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell, who will oversee Siri’s upgrades. “Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi,” PYMNTS reported. “Giannandrea will still oversee other AI efforts at Apple.” The post Apple to Tap User Data for LLM Training appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "It would be Apple's first overhaul of iPad multitasking since 2022's iPadOS 16. Apple is taking another crack at iPad multitasking, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. This year's iPadOS 19 release, due to be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9, will apparently include an \"overhaul that will make the tablet's software more like macOS.\" The report is light on details about what's actually changing, aside from a broad \"focus on productivity, multitasking, and app window management.\" But Apple will apparently continue to stop short of allowing users of newer iPads to run macOS on their tablets, despite the fact that modern iPad Airs and Pros use the same processors as Macs. If this is giving you déjà vu, you're probably thinking about iPadOS 16, the last time Apple tried making significant upgrades to the iPad's multitasking model. Gurman's reporting at the time even used similar language, saying that iPads running the new software would work \"more like a laptop and less like a phone.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "A surprise tariff exemption on key tech products is helping spur an Apple rally. HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty ImagesApple stock moved strongly higher on Monday, in contrast to tepid trading across the market.The company was lifted by President Trump saying he will exempt tariffs on certain electronic products.Trump's tariff whipsawing has generated considerable stock-market volatility in recent weeks.Embattled Apple investors have have caught a sudden break amid ongoing tariff chaos.The stock spiked more than 7% in early trading on Monday before settling about 2% higher as the rest of the market saw gains erased entirely.The increase is being driven by an announcement from the Trump administration that key tech products would be exempt from aggressive tariffs issued on China. Spared electronics include chipmaking equipment, computers, and smartphones.The news also boosted the broader stock market on Monday before indexes pared most of their gains.Here's where the Magnificent 7 stocks stood at mid-day on Monday:Apple: +2.3%Alphabet: +1%Microsoft: -0.4%Nvidia: -0.8%Tesla: -1.1%Meta: -1.8%Amazon: -2%Major stock indexes are seeking direction this week after posting their best week since 2023. It remains to be seen how protectionist trade policy pivots moving forward.Here's where major indexes were trading:S&P 500: 5,375.70, up 0.2%Dow Jones Industrial Average: 40,260.75, up 0.1% (48 points)Nasdaq Composite: 40,260.75, up 0.2%Bond markets also rallied on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year yield dropping 8 basis points. Treasurys have sparked investor anxiety amid the tariff turmoil, as rising yields indicated that foreign traders may be dumping government debt.Meanwhile, the dollar continued to trade near a three-year low, while cryptocurrencies staged a comeback. Bitcoin is now in the mid-$80,000 range.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Instead, tech products would be shifted to a different category of tariffs in the future, Trump said in a post to his social media plaform Truth Social. \"There was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday,\" Trump wrote. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'\"US President Donald Trump.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesHe added, \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick backed this position in an ABC News interview on Sunday and confirmed that tariffs affecting iPhones may return in the next month or so. The Trump administration has said its tariff strategy aims to bring more tech manufacturing to the US. But where does this rapidly evolving situation leave Apple? In the short term, it seems better than last week. Apple was coming off its worst three-day stock decline since 2001, while analysts had predicted doom scenarios in which iPhones could cost consumers over $2,000 if it passed on costs to consumers.The Friday exemptions were backdated to April 5. That's not insignificant for Apple, which Counterpoint Research estimates makes as much as 80% of its iPhones intended for the US in China. So far, the market has reacted positively. Apple shares were up more than 3% on Monday morning. But any moves this week that put Trump's words on Truth Social into action could sour sentiment again.This all subjects Apple to a constant whiplashing as it finds itself caught up in Trump's tariff strategy, and means it can't catch a break at all at a time when it's facing challenges elsewhere.It's not just tariffs On one front, Apple has been facing a steady decline in its sales in its most important international market: China.There, domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi have been putting out smartphones that rival the iPhone at aggressive prices. Apple's share of the smartphone market in the final quarter of 2024 totaled 17% — down from the 21% it held a year prior.The company is also facing challenges turning big new bets unveiled last year into hits. Its AI push with Apple Intelligence has suffered — an AI feature for Siri has been delayed — and the Vision Pro headset is struggling to capture the interest of consumers and developers.However, there are positives for Apple. Figures published on Monday by Counterpoint show that Apple is in the top spot of the smartphone market in the first quarter for the first time ever — a feat helped by the release of its cheaper iPhone 16e. Despite the recent sell-off, it remains one of the world's most valuable companies with hugely popular products, such as its smartwatches. There is also the possibility that Cook may be able to secure an exemption as he did during Trump's first term. The Apple CEO can hope that his years of effort building a tight relationship with Trump will pay off. For now, though, Apple can't catch a break.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple's fate depends on where Donald Trump finally decides to land on tariffs.Kevin Lamarque/Getty ImagesApple looked like it was off the hook for some tariffs.Then Donald Trump said there wasn't a tariff \"exception\" for tech products.The iPhone maker still doesn't know if it'll be free of tariffs that could impose high costs on China imports.It was good while it lasted, but Apple's reprieve was short-lived.On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be largely off the hook from Donald Trump's China tariffs after the US Customs and Border Protection announced an exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other tech gadgets.That would have come as a relief to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the company had been hit by 145% tariffs on the goods it manufactures and assembles from its supply chain hub in China.But on Sunday, there came a switch-up from Trump: he said the US tech industry wouldn't be free from additional tariffs after all.

        "description": "It’s been another chaotic weekend when it comes to President Trump’s tariff trade war. On Friday, it was announced that electronic devices like smartphones and computers would be exempt from the looming tariffs of up to 145%—music tech investors’ ears. But by Sunday, the president had said that any exemptions would be short-lived. Despite this tariff exemption whiplash, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are all currently up in premarket trading this morning—the first trading session after the tariff exemptions were initially announced. Here’s what you need to know. Tariff exemption whiplash Since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country in the world on April 2, the stock markets have been hammered. But perhaps even worse than the tariffs’ effect on the markets has been the messaging around the tariffs. At various times over the past two weeks, administration officials have stated that the tariffs are both open to negotiation and permanent. And now the messaging over tariff exemptions is equally as confusing. On Saturday, Bloomberg was the first to report that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is charged with managing tariffs on imported goods, had posted a bulletin day earlier, on April 11, that the Trump administration had declared tariff exemptions on certain electronic devices. These exemptions meant that many popular consumer items—and items that are also critical to the supply chains of America’s Big Tech companies—would not be hit with staggering 145% tariffs if being imported from China (and lower, but still high tariffs from other nations). The bulletin said there were now exemptions on smartphones, computers, tablets, and even smartwatches, among other electronic items. This news was particularly welcome to Apple’s investors, as the company sources many of its iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches from China. But this relief surrounding the tariff exemptions was short-lived. That’s because, on Sunday, April 13, Trump officials and President Trump himself stated that the just-published exemptions weren’t actually permanent. Policy confusion continues As noted by CNN, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told ABC News on Sunday morning that “(Electronics are) exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” In other words, Lutnick seemed to confirm that smartphones and laptops are indeed exempt from the existing reciprocal tariffs. However, he further implied that, in a few months, the Trump administration will be rolling out another new type of tariff to cover items with semiconductors (computer chips) inside. That would mean smartphones and laptops will be hit with tariffs then. Lutnick also said that upcoming tariffs targeting products that are key to national security, which likely include semiconductor products, are “not available for negotiation.” President Trump also chimed in on Sunday on Truth Social, announcing that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump went on to claim that “There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday.” He said that the reportedly previously announced exempted products like smartphones and laptops were still subject to an existing 20% fentanyl tariff “and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” “The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” the president continued. “We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” Big tech stocks react in Monday trading While Apple would undoubtedly be the biggest winner from any electronics exemptions in the tariffs on China, nearly every major tech company would benefit as well. Even if they do not sell physical hardware products, they rely on servers and other electronics to keep their software services running. So it’s no wonder that, what the Trump administration says is now just a temporary pause, is still being met with a positive reaction in the markets when it comes to the stock prices of the Magnificent Seven. Here’s how Mag Seven stocks are reacting at the time of this writing in premarket trading: Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG): up 1.4% Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN): up 1.6% Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL): up 4.9% Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META): up 1.7% Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT): up 0.8% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): up 1.8% Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA): up 1.3% It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that while the Trump administration says any tariff exemptions are temporary, you have to take that with a grain of salt—or at least be aware that things could change in the future. The administration’s stance on tariffs—or at least the administration’s messaging around its stance on tariffs—has been all over the place this month. Things could be very different a week from now, as Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed out this weekend. “Nobody can figure out what the rules will be five days from now, much less five years from now,” she said (via CNN). This story is developing . . .",

        "description": "According to a new study by a software company called Instabug, AI models work better with Apple’s iOS than Google's Android when it comes to fixing mobile crashes. The company created a tool called SmartResolve which uses AI to detect app crashes, it causes and suggests code fixes. It was also revealed that it worked more effectively with iOS than Android. The tool was tested using various AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and Google on real app crashes.The main finding on all this was that AI models do better crash fixing on Apple’s iOS than on Android. The fixes on iOS were more accurate, better structured, and clearer across almost all models that were tested. Gemini 1.5 Pro, Google’s own AI model, wasn't able to do well on Android and scored 51.41% as compared to 58.53% on iOS. GPT-4o scored 59.81% on iOS and 48.97% on Android, while the o1 model scored 61.79% on iOS and 26.31% on Android. Claude's Sonnet 3.5 V1 scored 58.33% on iOS and 55.56% on Android.According to Sherief Abul-Ezz's blog post, \"The results highlight that most models performed better on iOS, with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku V1, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V1 emerging as the strongest contenders due to their consistency and structured outputs.\" Adding further, \"Conversely, models like LLaMA-3-70b and OpenAI o1 struggled significantly, particularly on Android, due to poor correctness, frequent failures, and slow response times.\"The chief product officer of Instabug, Kenny Johnston, said that iOS’s bigger success rate is mostly because of how its native languages like Objective-C and Swift are structured which makes AI models to detect and generate accurate fixes. On the other hand, Android uses Kotlin and Java have more variability in crash formats so AI cannot detect it accurately.

        "description": "Almost 23 years ago, an employee at Apple described Steve Jobs to me as one of the world’s few “rock star CEOs.” At the time, I didn’t understand why anyone would talk about the head of a company in that way. A rock star was an artist who defined the cultural moment and attracted a legion of rabid fans. A CEO was just a CEO, right? In my defense, I was young. I knew little about Jobs’s personal background or his impact on tech sector—this was just over a year after Apple had introduced the original iPod, and the device hadn’t yet completely taken over the world. Still, I smiled and nodded appropriately. After all, the rockstar CEO’s company had just hired me in a sales role. However, over the next five years that I worked for Apple, I came to understand what that person meant. My job at Apple was low-level and non-technical—nothing anyone would find too interesting. Yet when someone discovered that I worked for the company, their eyes lit up, and one of their first questions was, inevitably, “So, what is Steve Jobs like?” I never met Jobs personally, but I once saw him inside Caffe Macs—Apple’s employee cafeteria at 1 Infinite Loop. I recall relaying this mere fact to someone who had asked me if I met him, and to this day, I remember their reply: “Count yourself lucky. Very few people will ever be in the same room with a historical figure.” They went on to explain that listening to their iPod mini was often the best part of their day—and asked me to tell Jobs, if I ever did meet him, that they were thankful there was someone like him inventing such cool devices. That’s when I realized that Jobs really was a rock star—revered even by complete strangers. Now, 20 years after that encounter, having witnessed how technology has infiltrated every facet of our lives in ways even he probably couldn’t have foreseen, I have come to believe Steve Jobs will likely be the last nearly universally beloved tech leader the world will ever have. And that’s probably a good thing. The Musk Factor This realization didn’t just come out of the blue. I’d been thinking about tech CEOs a lot lately—one in particular: Elon Musk. I’ll fully admit that back in the early 2010s, I was a big fan of Musk. I admired how he was bringing electric vehicles to the masses and popularizing more climate-friendly means of transportation and energy distribution. It seemed that his products could genuinely change the world for the better. It also struck me that he was, in my then-opinion, the most charismatic tech leader since Jobs. When he spoke, people listened. Like Jobs, he appeared to be a visionary—and that was inspiring. During the early 2010s, I was convinced that he would be the world’s next Steve Jobs—a tech luminary who would change the world just as Jobs did and, like Jobs, be nearly universally beloved for it. Boy, was I wrong. I’ve never been in the same room as Musk, much less met him, so I won’t try to explain what has seemingly happened—why he changed so much over the past few years (or decided to reveal his true self). However, seeing furious people across the world picketing at his stores, I am certain that he will never be the next Steve Jobs. And there is no other tech CEO in the running, either. And I believe there are two main reasons for this. Big Tech—and its role in the world—has changed For one thing, Big Tech has become fairly toxic since Steve Jobs died in 2011. Silicon Valley used to inspire the general public. Every month in the early 2000s, it seemed like some new product or service was launched that truly improved our lives. However, in the last 15 years, many people feel that Big Tech has begun to cause more harm than good For all their convenience, e-commerce giants like Amazon undermine small businesses, which can be a contributing factor in their closure. When that happens, local communities become more barren, and people struggle to pay the bills. That breeds resentment towards Big Tech—not love of their billionaire CEOs. Similarly, while social media was once touted as a democratizing force that would unite people and facilitate the sharing of ideas, it is now widely recognized to have negative implications for individuals’ mental health, serve as a breeding ground for bullying, and is today a significant way misinformation and political polarization spreads. As Pew Research noted, most people also think social media giants have too much influence in politics. Again, none of this is going to endear the CEOs of these companies to the population at large. And the latest tech revolution—artificial intelligence—isn’t generating a lot of love from the general public, either. AI is likely to eliminate millions of jobs over the next three years alone. It’s also taking the humanity out of art. No wonder a YouGov poll last year found that the majority of Americans were cautious, concerned, and skeptical of AI. If you’re the CEO of a company that works on a technology that most people are leery of, you’re not going to find a lot of universal adoration. Yet there’s another reason why today’s tech leaders will likely never achieve Jobsian status. Big Tech is now inextricably entwined with politics and power in a way it never was in Jobs’s time. Elections are fought and won on social media, wars are carried out with the help of the hardware and software Silicon Valley builds, and Big Tech is spending tens of millions of dollars a year in political contributions and lobbying efforts in an attempt to influence government policy on everything from taxes to regulations—not to mention curry favor with politicians. Politics and power are, by their very nature, divisive. And America is more polarized today by orders of magnitude than during Jobs’s early-2000’s professional prime. If you love that Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg were honored guests at President Trump’s latest inauguration, you can bet that at least half the nation hates it. The Steve Jobs legacy All this is not to suggest that Steve Jobs was a saint, of course. It’s been well-documented that he could be difficult to work with and short-tempered in his pursuit of creative perfection. He was beloved as much as he was because he operated in a world before Big Tech was viewed as a Big Villain. And, unlike many of today’s tech leaders, Jobs chose to—or could afford to—keep his politics private. And he was beloved because nearly all of the products he helped unleash seemed to bring joy to the majority of their users, like the individual I met two decades ago who was grateful to Jobs for the simple everyday pleasure he derived from using his iPod mini. Given how the world—and Big Tech’s role in it—has changed since Jobs’s passing, I don’t believe we’ll ever have another tech leader as beloved as he was. And, again, I think that is probably a good thing. As much of a fan as I was of Jobs, the deification of any one individual is dangerous—especially in today’s environment, where modern tech leaders already wield significant influence over the platforms we use, the narratives we encounter, and even public policy itself. But in Jobs’ time, it was much more palatable—and harmless. The person who explained to me that Steve Jobs was a historical figure is now correct. Jobs was a product of a bygone era: a beloved leader in tech.",

        "description": "President Donald Trump’s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.But that’s an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China — the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.“The concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,” asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple’s every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn’t be done until, at the earliest, 2028. “Price points would move so dramatically, it’s hard to comprehend.”Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump’s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company’s financial results and strategy.And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple’s stock price has dropped by 15% and lowered the company’s market value by $500 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley’s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs’ toll on the company’s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple’s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump’s tariffs.“Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,” Chatterjee said.Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence — a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple’s investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. “If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,” Leavitt said.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” Lutnick said.But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.“In the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I’m not sure we could fill the room,” Cook said. “In China, you could fill multiple football fields.”Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then — a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump’s first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. “Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,” Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019. —Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer",

This time around, Trump is even more aggressive about punishing China — which Cook depends on to make his iPhones.One thing in Cook's favor: Apple is so big that the ripple effects from its tariff troubles could affect lots of people.The tariffs are paused, except the ones that aren't. Which includes a whopping 145% for products shipped from China.What does that mean for Apple?Yes, lots of giant tech companies have deep ties to China, from Amazon to Meta to Tesla. But Apple is fully enmeshed in China, where it has spent years building up the supply chain for its iPhones, which are the company's core business.If those tariffs stay in place, it could jack up the price of an iPhone by hundreds of dollars. Maybe more.So now what?Spoiler: No one seems to know. (An Apple rep declined to comment; I haven't heard back from the White House.) But if you're an Apple optimist, you are probably wishing for one, or both, of these plans.Plan one: Tim Apple to the rescue.After Trump's first election in 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook basically wrote the playbook for business leaders hoping to stay afloat in Trumpland. He frequently engaged with Trump privately, never criticized him publicly, and was willing to play along when Trump wanted to use Apple as a symbol of Big American Companies That Are Coming Back to America.That included keeping mum when the president falsely claimed that Apple had opened a MacBook plant in Texas during Trump's reign (the plant had opened years before, during the Obama administration).And that work paid off when Apple got exemptions from the China tariffs Trump enacted during his first term.Now Apple bulls are hopeful Cook will find a way to wriggle out again. They're especially buoyed by Trump's comments on Wednesday suggesting he will give certain companies some kind of tariff relief.\"Some companies, through no fault of their own, they happen to be in an industry that is more affected by these things than others,\" Trump said. \"You have to be able to show a little flexibility, and I'm able to do that.\"On the one hand, it would seem much harder for Trump to give Apple a pass this time around, since his administration has consistently talked about getting Apple to build iPhones in the US. Exempting Apple from some or all of his tariffs makes that even less likely.On the other hand, Trump is consistently inconsistent. For instance, while it is engaging with China in a trade war and talking about the need for the US to stay ahead of China in the AI arms race, Trump's administration has reportedly given Nvidia its blessing to sell its top-of-the-line chips to China. Prior to that, Trump was reportedly set to halt those sales.Plan two: The short-term end-runMaybe Cook convinces Trump to give Apple a pass, or a partial pass. But in the meantime, Cook has been trying to give himself as much flexibility as possible, by reportedly shipping planeloads of iPhones — perhaps as many as 1.5 million units — from China and India to the US in advance of new tariffs. That would give him the ability to keep selling the current versions of iPhones at the same price, at the same profit margin, at least for a while.But then what? Apple usually unveils, and starts shipping, new iPhone models in the fall. It's almost impossible to imagine those getting made anywhere but China, no matter how hard Apple scrambles to find extra production capacity in lower tariff countries like Vietnam or India. And those 1.5 million older model phones won't satisfy demand for a company that sells a reported 220 million phones a year around the world.And … that's kind of it, as far as options go. Note that there's no real consideration of Apple building up a brand new supply chain infrastructure that's fully separate from China — certainly not in the short to mid-term.Meanwhile, even if you don't own an iPhone and/or never plan on buying a new one again, Apple's iPhone dilemma is probably still your dilemma. Even if you don't own Apple stock directly, you are almost certainly exposed to it, because the $3 trillion company makes up a giant slice makes up a giant slice of the major stock indexes.As journalist Patrick McGee notes: \"If your retirement is invested in index funds, Apple is your single biggest investment.\"The fact that Apple's stock price only dropped by 4% on Thursday — compared to 7% drops for Meta and Tesla, and 5% for Amazon and Nvidia — suggests that investors feel reasonably confident that Tim Cook can navigate this one.

        "description": "Blockbuster report by Wayne Ma for The Information (paywalled and pricey, alas): But an equally important factor was the conflicting personalities within Apple, according to multiple people who worked in the AI and software engineering groups. More than half a dozen former Apple employees who worked in the AI and machine-learning group led by Giannandrea — known as AI/ML for short — told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution. They singled out Walker as lacking both ambition and an appetite for taking risks on designing future versions of the voice assistant. Among engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and struggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable nickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess. Ouch. Ma names names, and the report is full of scoops: One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that didn’t move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant. For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said. Another pet Walker project was removing the “hey” from the “hey Siri” voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more than two years to accomplish, they said. What Ma describes is a scenario where Walker missed the fact that the whole forest sucked and didn’t work while focusing on one or two nice trees. Faster response times are a great win, no question, but marginally faster wrong or useless answers are not a win. Obviously fast helpful answers are the goal, but slow helpful answers are infinitely better than fast useless ones. (I’m almost not sure eliminating the requirement to use the verbal “hey” prefix was a win at all. It’s purely anecdotal and personal, but I think I get more unwanted invocations now than I did when “Hey Siri” was the required prompt. Like when I’m talking to someone and start a sentence with “Seriously …” Siri will kick in on one of my devices with a “Sorry, I didn’t catch that.”) One last nugget: Other resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering group were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their colleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter that some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take longer vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced more-punishing work schedules. Distrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year one of Giannandrea’s deputies asked engineers to extensively document the development of a joint project so that if it failed, Federighi’s group couldn’t scapegoat the AI team. It didn’t help the relations between the groups when Federighi began amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning engineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by one of Federighi’s top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes. Hundreds of engineers for a machine learning team outside Apple’s AI/ML division sounds like the definition of dysfunction. I really doubt Federighi has also assembled a large team of silicon engineers outside Johny Srouji’s division, because Srouji’s team is not merely functional, but rightly regarded as one the highest-functioning engineering divisions in any field in the world. I wish I could share a gift link to Ma’s report, but The Information’s gift links for subscribers only work for up to three people. The best I can do is point to Hartley Charlton’s summary for MacRumors. ★ Blockbuster report by Wayne Ma for The Information (paywalled and pricey, alas): But an equally important factor was the conflicting personalities within Apple, according to multiple people who worked in the AI and software engineering groups. More than half a dozen former Apple employees who worked in the AI and machine-learning group led by Giannandrea — known as AI/ML for short — told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution. They singled out Walker as lacking both ambition and an appetite for taking risks on designing future versions of the voice assistant. Among engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and struggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable nickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess. Ouch. Ma names names, and the report is full of scoops: One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that didn’t move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant. For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said.

The rest of the iPhone 16 series, including the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, was released on September 20, 2024.The oldest iPhones Apple still sells in a new condition are the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, which were released on September 22, 2023.Below is a breakdown of the seven iPhones in Apple's current lineup, including the latest series and previous-generation models.The latest iPhones are the iPhone 16 seriesThe iPhone 16e is the newest iPhone, released on February 28, 2025. It starts at $599 and serves as Apple's entry-level value option. It runs the same powerful A18 processor as the iPhone 16 and supports Apple Intelligence features, too. See our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 guide for a comprehensive comparison.For its more affordable price tag, the iPhone 16e comes with compromises. Notably, it only has a single camera and omits the standard ultrawide camera on other iPhones. It also lacks Apple's Dynamic Island and its useful functionality and features instead of the static notch introduced with the iPhone X in 2017. There's also no larger \"Plus\" model of the iPhone 16e.The iPhone 16e is the newest iPhone and the latest model of the iPhone 16 series.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderOther feature gaps include connectivity to the fastest 5G networks, known as mmWave 5G. Still, the iPhone 16e supports low- and mid-band 5G networks, which are fast enough for most people's needs.The iPhone 16e also doesn't feature MagSafe support, which means it doesn't magnetically attach to MagSafe chargers and accessories. Still, this can be mitigated with a third-party case that includes MagSafe magnets.You can use a MagSafe case to wirelessly charge the iPhone 16e on a MagSafe charger, but it'll only charge at the Qi standard's 7.5W rate, significantly slower than MagSafe's speeds of up to 25W.Read our full iPhone 16e review, and see our guide to the best iPhone 16e cases.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus were released on September 20, 2024. The standard iPhone 16 is the top pick in our best iPhone guide for its balance of performance, features, and value. The iPhone 16 Plus is basically a larger version of the iPhone 16 with the same performance, design, and features, except for its larger 6.7-inch display, extended battery life, and higher price tag.The iPhone 16 (pictured in the Ultramarine color option) and iPhone 16 Plus (pictured in the pink color option) were released during Apple's usual September event in 2024.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderWith the iPhone 16 series, Apple considerably narrowed the gap between the base and Pro models by including features like Apple Intelligence, the Camera Control button, macro photography, ray tracing for games, faster MagSafe charging, an improved ultrawide camera, and the Action button in the base iPhone 16.While the base iPhone 16 models don't feature a dedicated zoom lens like the iPhone 16 Pro models, they have an optical-quality 2x zoom option that expands the cameras' range while maintaining flawless quality.For the price, it's only lacking Apple's ProMotion display that supports up to 120Hz refresh rate, which we feel should be standard on a phone in the $800 price range.Read our combined iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus review, and see our guides to the best iPhone 16 cases or iPhone 16 Plus cases.The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max were released on the same day as the base iPhone 16 models — September 20, 2024. With the iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple introduced new and larger 6.3 and 6.9-inch screen sizes. These models are best for people who value or often take zoomed photos, as they feature a dedicated 5x zoom lens.The iPhone 16 Pro (pictured) and iPhone 16 Pro Max were released in September 2024 alongside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderThey also include Apple's A18 Pro processor for the longest-lasting performance and unlock several professional features that truly fulfill the \"Pro\" denomination. These include 4K video recording at 120 frames-per-second (fps) in the Dolby Vision HDR standard; the ProRes, LOG, and ACES video recording formats; ProRAW photos; a studio-quality four-microphone array; and a USB-C port that supports up to USB 3 data transfer speeds.The iPhone 16 Pro models support Apple's ProMotion display with 120Hz refresh rates. This display delivers smoother animations when swiping around the iOS operating system and apps, imparting a premium feel that the iPhone 16's standard 60Hz display simply can't replicate.Read our combined iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max review, and see our guides to the best iPhone 16 Pro cases or iPhone 16 Pro Max cases.Apple still sells two previous-generation phonesApple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus remain available in new condition from the company, though they're not new or part of the latest generation.The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus were released on September 22, 2023, alongside the now-discontinued iPhone 15 Pro models.The iPhone 15 (pictured) and iPhone 15 Plus were released in September 2023.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are in an awkward position among Apple's iPhone lineup. On one hand, they run on an older processor than the iPhone 16e, and despite their higher prices, they can't run Apple Intelligence features.On the other hand, they're technically more high-end, as they include almost all the missing features we'd usually expect on iPhones, like an ultrawide camera, built-in MagSafe support, mmWave 5G connectivity, and the Dynamic Island.See our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15 guide for a comparative breakdown.Read the original article on Business Insider",

The effort, which brought up to 1.5 million of Apple’s flagship smartphones into the country, came after the company ceased productions in India to overcome President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Reuters reported Thursday (April 10), citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans. […] The post Apple’s Anti-Tariff Tactic: Flying 1.5 Million iPhones From India appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple has reportedly flown 600 tons of iPhones into the U.S. in an anti-tariff measure. The effort, which brought up to 1.5 million of Apple’s flagship smartphones into the country, came after the company ceased productions in India to overcome President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Reuters reported Thursday (April 10), citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans. According to the report, analysts warn that iPhone prices could rocket up in the U.S. due to Apple’s dependence on Chinese imports. China is the company’s chief manufacturing hub, and is facing a 125% tariff rate. India, meanwhile, has a much lower rate — 26% — which is now on hold after Trump instituted a 90-day tariff pause on all countries aside from China. Apple “wanted to beat the tariff,” one of the sources told Reuters. That source said the company had campaigned to get Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to make it through customs at the Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, from 30 hours down to just six hours. Apple sells upwards of 220 million iPhones worldwide each year, the report said, citing data from Counterpoint Research showing that 20% of those phone imports to the U.S. are from India, with the remainder coming from China. The Reuters report suggests that Apple’s plans were in place long before the tariffs, or even before Trump’s election victory, with a senior Indian official saying that the company had spent about eight months arranging its fast-tracked customs clearance. As noted here earlier in the week — in a previous report on Apple’s plans to use India to offset the tariff costs — the tech giant was among the companies that saw the biggest stock market losses after the new levies were announced. “The decline in shares of Apple erased $300 billion from the company’s market cap, largely because of the iPhone maker’s overseas production hubs,” PYMNTS wrote. When Trump announced the pause Thursday, the markets recovered somewhat, with the Dow surging by nearly 2,000 points, bringing temporary relief to many industries and markets, PYMNTS wrote in a separate report Thursday. “However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications,” that report added. “The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time.

        "description": "Tech giant Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India, after it stepped up production there in an effort to beat President Donald Trump’s tariffs, sources told Reuters. The details of the push provide an insight into the U.S. smartphone company’s private strategy to navigate around the Trump tariffs and build up inventory of its popular iPhones in the United States, one of its biggest markets. Analysts have warned that U.S. prices of iPhones could surge, given Apple’s high reliance on imports from China, the main manufacturing hub of the devices, which is subject to Trump’s highest tariff rate of 125%. That figure is far in excess of the tariff of 26% on imports from India, but which is now on hold after Trump called a 90-day pause this week that excludes China. Apple “wanted to beat the tariff,” said one of the sources familiar with the planning. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut to six hours the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, down from 30 hours, the source added. The so-called “green corridor” arrangement at the airport in the Indian manufacturing hub emulated a model Apple uses at some airports in China, the source said. About six cargo jets with a capacity of 100 tons each have flown out since March, one of them this week just as new tariffs kicked in, the source and an Indian government official said. The packaged weight of an iPhone 14 and its charging cable come to about 350 grams (12.35 oz), Reuters measurements show, implying the total cargo of 600 tons comprised about 1.5 million iPhones, after accounting for some packaging weight. Apple and India’s aviation ministry did not respond to a request for comment. All the sources sought anonymity as the strategy and discussions were private. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year worldwide, with Counterpoint Research estimating a fifth of total iPhone imports to the United States now come from India, and the rest from China. Trump consistently increased U.S. tariffs on China, to stand at 125% by Wednesday, from 54% earlier. At the 54% tariff rate, the $1,599 cost of the top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the United States would have surged to $2,300, calculations based on projections by Rosenblatt Securities show. SUNDAY SHIFTS In India, Apple stepped up air shipments to meet its goal of a 20% increase in usual production at iPhone plants, attained by adding workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggest Foxconn India factory to Sundays, the source added. Two other direct sources confirmed the Foxconn plant in Chennai now runs on Sundays, which is typically a holiday. The plant turned out 20 million iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models. As Apple diversifies its manufacturing beyond China, it has positioned India for a critical role. Foxconn and Tata, its two main suppliers there, have three factories in all, with two more being built. Apple spent about eight months to plan and set up the expedited customs clearance in Chennai, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government asked officials to support Apple, one senior Indian official said. Foxconn shipments from India to the United States surged in value to $770 million in January and $643 million in February, compared to the range of $110 million to $331 million in the prior four months, commercially available customs data shows. More than 85% of the January and February air shipments of Foxconn were offloaded in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Foxconn did not respond to Reuters’ queries. —Aditya Kalra, Abhijith Ganapavaram and Munsif Vengattil, Reuters",

But the technology works a lot better with Apple's iOS platform than Google's Android, according to a study released on Thursday.A software company called Instabug built a tool called SmartResolve that uses leading AI models to automate the process of spotting app crashes, diagnosing what's wrong, and generating usable software code fixes.They used models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta against a dataset of real-world app crashes. Each fix was scored on correctness, similarity to human fixes, depth of root-cause analysis, relevance, and overall coherence.A big takeaway: AI models consistently perform better on iOS than on Android. Instabug found on Apple's platform, crash fixes were more accurate, coherent, and well-structured across nearly every model tested.Even Google's AI model did worse AndroidOpenAI's models, for example, delivered significantly better results on iOS. GPT-4o scored 60% on iOS versus 49% on Android. With OpenAI's o1 model, the difference was even more dramatic: It hit 62% on iOS but dropped to 26% on Android, often failing to respond entirely in Android tests.Other models followed a similar pattern. Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5 V1 scored 58% on iOS and 56% on Android — a smaller gap, but still an iOS lead.Even Google's own Gemini 1.5 Pro performed worse on Android (51%) than on iOS (59%). Instabug found that it also faced more hallucination issues when using its larger context window.Why does Android lag behind?The discrepancy may come from Android's fragmented ecosystem. Compared to iOS, which offers a more uniform environment, Android's broader range of devices and crash types can make it harder for AI models to generalize fixes.\"The stronger performance on iOS is partially due to the structure of iOS native languages like Swift and Objective-C,\" Kenny Johnston, Instabug's chief product officer, said. \"Their syntax is more predictable and strongly typed, which makes it easier for LLMs to generate accurate fixes.\"Johnston said Android's languages — Java and Kotlin — plus crash format variability means higher complexity for fixes.

Batman and Spiderman assembling tech products. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance stitching red hats in a factory.These are some of the memes — many of which are AI-generated —that have been spreading on Chinese social media sites like Rednote and Weibo to mock Americans over Trump's tariffs.Trump has cited national security and a large trade deficit with China as reasons to raise duties on the long time rival and manufacturing hub. He also accused China of currency manipulation to offset the impact of tariffs. During Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement, he said China has been charging the US 67% in duties.One of the most viral memes, which has crossed over to American audiences on sites like TikTok and X, shows Americans in t-shirts looking sad as they sew clothes in a factory or screw cell phones together on an assembly line.Traditional Chinese music plays over the scenes, and Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\" flashes across the screen at the end of the apparently AI-generated video. One X user's post of the viral meme has been viewed more than 7 million times, and a TikTok post of the video has been shared over 34,000 times.The memes play on the concerns that Trump's significant tariffs on China, and his repeated calls to reduce US reliance on foreign goods and shore up American manufacturing, will hurt everyday Americans and be potentially regressive. While Trump has paused tariffs on other trading partners for 90 days on Wednesday, tariffs on China now stand at 125%.\"When you wanted to bring back manufacturing jobs to the US but you lost your overpaid, cushy powerpoint / excel job and now gotta hit the assembly line,\" wrote one user on X above a screenshot of \"The White Lotus\" character Piper looking emotional over not being able to endure living conditions in Thailand.The fear that white collar workers might soon need to work in factories builds on comments made by politicians like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Tucker Carlson's show last Friday that fired office workers could find manufacturing jobs \"to re-lever the private sector.\"\"So what we are doing: on one side, the President is reordering trade. On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down federal borrowings,\" said Bessent. \"And then on the other side of that, we will have the labor we need for new manufacturing.\"Other memes call out the countries Trump initially targeted in his sweeping tariffs, such as his 10% tariffs on the Heard and McDonald Islands. The group of Antarctic islands is an Australian external territory inhabited only by penguins, seals, and seabirds.One Rednote post includes a clip of \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" over a news article about the tariffs on the islands. \"Captain, walking into hostile environment,\" the penguins in the clip say. \"We're gonna need special tactical equipments. We're gonna face extreme peril.\"Also on Rednote, a slideshow of photos, some AI generated, depicts penguins wearing a red \"Make America Go Away\" hat, wielding weapons, and participating in a mass protest against Trump.The tariff war has also generated a renewed wave of nationalism on Chinese social media site Weibo. Users are rallying behind their government's decision to retaliate, temporarily leaving behind dissatisfactions toward the ruling party over the country's economic downturn since the pandemic.\"Fully support,\" wrote one commenter under a state media post about China raising retaliatory tariffs to 84% on the US that garnered nearly a million likes. \"May 1 holiday would be spent supporting domestic products.\"Another commenter cited an ancient Chinese tale from the Qin Dynasty, that when a nation ceded five cities to a large and powerful enemy, the invader soon asked for ten cities and more. In this context, the cautionary story is being used to justify why China should not make any concessions towards the US.A Bluesky comment perhaps best sums up how many tariff stricken Americans feel toward the long-time authoritarian rival right now: \"If you told my 2024 self I'd be rooting for China to not back down, I'd have said you were crazy.\"Read the original article on Business Insider An AI-generated meme of Donald Trump and JD Vance sewing red hats in a factory.Rednote user 拿到王炸没Memes that mock Americans over Trump's tariffs have taken over Chinese social media.AI generated videos feature Trump and tech workers on the iPhone assembly line or sewing clothes.Scott Bessent said that \"excess labor\" in the federal government could be labor for manufacturing.A finance bro in a Patagonia vest sobbing as he sews a sock.

Users are rallying behind their government's decision to retaliate, temporarily leaving behind dissatisfactions toward the ruling party over the country's economic downturn since the pandemic.\"Fully support,\" wrote one commenter under a state media post about China raising retaliatory tariffs to 84% on the US that garnered nearly a million likes. \"May 1 holiday would be spent supporting domestic products.\"Another commenter cited an ancient Chinese tale from the Qin Dynasty, that when a nation ceded five cities to a large and powerful enemy, the invader soon asked for ten cities and more. In this context, the cautionary story is being used to justify why China should not make any concessions towards the US.A Bluesky comment perhaps best sums up how many tariff stricken Americans feel toward the long-time authoritarian rival right now: \"If you told my 2024 self I'd be rooting for China to not back down, I'd have said you were crazy.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The Trump administration's massive tariffs on China have Apple reportedly flying planes full of iPhones to the U.S. and consumers rushing to buy them before the prices potentially skyrocket.Why it matters: The iPhone maker is one of many large companies caught up in an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Around 90% of iPhones are assembled in China, and more than half of iPhone sales are in the U.S.Driving the news: China announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on imports of U.S. goods on Wednesday after President Trump imposed a sweeping 104% tariff on Chinese goods, including clothes, shoes, toys and tech products.Trump later Wednesday announced he was increasing tariffs on China to 125% while pausing the sweeping reciprocal tariffs the U.S. imposed to other countries this week.State of play: U.S. consumers are rushing to stores to buy iPhones in anticipation that the new tariffs will prompt Apple to raise prices.Some customers told the WSJ that they aren't waiting to see if iPhone costs increase, with one person stating that \"the tariffs for sure pushed me out of the door.\"During the final week of March, Apple transported five planes full of iPhones and other products from India to the U.S. to avoid a 10% reciprocal tariff imposed by the Trump administration that took effect on April 5, according to The Times of India, citing senior Indian officials.Apple is also looking to ship more of its products to the U.S. from other countries, like India, to avoid the China tariffs, per WSJ.Zoom in: Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB could rise $350, or 29%, lifting the price tag to $1,549, according to data from UBS Investment Research. And that was before Trump increased the China levy again on Wednesday.What they're saying: Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"Category 5 Price Storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets.These tariffs on China and other nations is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he said.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Between the lines: Apple's stock, along with much of the market, roared back Wednesday afternoon after Trump announced a pause on reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for every nation but China.During the tariff meltdown, the company had suffered its worst three-day rout since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in 2001, seeing its market cap plummet by more than $500 billion.Of note: Most iPhones are manufactured in China and they account for about half of Apple's revenue.Apple can turn to alternate iPhone suppliers like India and Vietnam but it would take time and investment before they could match China's huge output.The Trump administration has said Apple should shift iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., but Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously stressed that it's not possible to find skilled industrial labor in the U.S. on a scale anywhere near what China offers.What to watch: Apple will report its second-quarter results on May 1, when executives are expected to discuss the effects of tariffs.

President Donald Trump is in a tariff battle with China, the main country that Apple depends on for manufacturing its products.With a 104% tariff in effect on Chinese imported goods, Apple is facing a tough decision: raise prices or find another way to offset the costs.With iPhone prices at risk of going up, customers are flocking to their local Apple stores to upgrade now rather than later.\"It's not innovation or a broken phone that brought me to the store,\" 42-year-old Joseph Donnelly told Business Insider after posting about his upgrade online.He had been planning on holding onto his iPhone 13 Pro until the iPhone 17 came out, but traded it in for an iPhone 16 Pro Max on Saturday after the tariffs were announced. Donnelly said he drew the line at paying an extra 20% or more for \"an incremental improvement\" on current or future models.At the downtown Brooklyn Apple store on Tuesday, I waited around 15 minutes to talk to a team member about iPhones since they were all occupied by customers setting up their new phones, they said. When I spoke with an employee, she told me the Tuesday crowd was nothing compared to the chaos on the weekend.As we stood around the iPhone display table, another customer, who asked not to be named, told me he was upgrading \"before they get way more expensive.\"\"I'm just getting the cheapest one to last me a few years,\" he said as he played with the $599 iPhone 16e.BI reached out to Apple, but the company declined to share data on store traffic or sales.Before Trump added a further bump to China's tariff rate, analysts had estimated a 40% price increase on tech devices. The iPhone 16 Pro Max, for example, would go from $1,599 to just under $2,300, according to BI's previous calculations. The 104% reciprocal tariff would push its top iPhone model well over $2,300 if Apple decides to let the cost fall to consumers.As Apple rolled out the iPhone 16 and its AI offerings in 2024, analysts predicted an upgrade supercycle. That didn't happen right away, but tariff fears could — briefly — spark an iPhone sales boom the tech industry has been discussing for nearly a year.Donnelly said he's content with his new iPhone 16 Pro Max for the next two years, at least.\"Maybe if the tariffs end by the 20th anniversary of the iPhone in 2027, I'll probably upgrade then, too,\" he told BI.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple stores are packed with concerned customers.Jordan Hart/BIApple users have been heading to stores to upgrade ahead of potential tariff-driven price hikes.Donald Trump increased tariffs on China, a hub for iPhone production, to 104% beginning Wednesday.Tariffs on Chinese imports could increase iPhone prices by over 40%, analysts say.Apple users are trying to get ahead of tariffs.The crowds at Apple stores over the weekend had Black Friday vibes, a retail employee said, but shoppers weren't there for holiday gifts.

        "description": "Some analysts predict some iPhone models will increase in price by $350.Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesSome analysts predict Apple could hike iPhone prices by up to $350 because of new tariffs.Apple's costs are expected to go up roughly 30% to 50% from tariffs, analysts said.Apple will try to negotiate with Trump and suppliers to avoid passing on the full costs to consumers, analysts said.President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement sent some consumers rushing to upgrade their iPhones because they were afraid of price increases. But how much more could you end up paying for a new iPhone?Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that iPhones and other Apple devices could go up \"hundreds of dollars.\"With the White House announcing plans to implement a total tariff rate of 104% on China, BI spoke to seven analysts about what consumers can expect in terms of price hikes.Estimated price increases of 30% to 40%In a blog post outlining how some tech products will be impacted by tariffs, UBS's Chief Investment Office wrote that the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256 GB, which is assembled in Mainland China, will likely see a price hike of $350 — bringing its price tag up to $1,549.Not all Apple products are likely to see the same price increases. For example, the iPhone 16 Pro with 128 GB is assembled in India, which is set to have a total 26% tariff rate that goes into effect on Wednesday. That model is expected to increase by 12%, which would be $120, UBS wrote in the blog.UBS wrote that it's \"near impossible\" to come up with exact figures on price increases, and it's also unclear how much the iPhone company will end up passing on to consumers.Bourne told BI that if consumers are grappling with tariffs on other goods, and also possibly dealing with a market crisis, they \"aren't going to want to pay\" for that kind of increase.\"Consumers really have to look at their bandwidth for discretionary expenses and certainly Apple's products, including the iPhone, can be a big ticket item,\" Bourne said.Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said that if Apple ends up passing on the costs to consumers, companies like Samsung, which are less impacted by tariffs, could gain a competitive edge.However, IHT Wealth Management chief investment officer Yussef Gheriani told BI that \"customers are too entrenched in their ecosystem to easily break from the brand.\" Gheriani said he expects \"a majority if not all of the cost increases\" that Apple endures to be passed on to consumers, although it's possible telecom companies could take on some of the costs, or that financing Apple purchases becomes more common. That could make price increases \"easier to swallow,\" he said.Why Apple may be able to get away with price hikesDipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, told BI that Apple can probably increase prices for some of its products, like the iPhone, \"without significant detriment,\" even if it has high margins and could afford to absorb some of the costs of tariffs.Chatterjee said many people have their lives \"entangled\" with Apple platforms and might not want to switch to a new brand. He said that people change their iPhones every year or two and line up the night before product launches to get the latest version of something that isn't much different from what other brands are offering.\"People do that because it's Apple, right,\" Chatterjee said. \"There's something about the brand that demands even now a degree of sort of fanaticism and loyalty.\"Apple will try to strike a dealChatterjee told BI that Apple could try a more long-term approach of moving its manufacturing to the US or move production from high-tariff countries to lower-tariff countries. Apple has already reportedly tried to do so, with plans underway to source more iPhones from India, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.In the short term though, all of the analysts BI spoke to agreed that Apple will try to avoid the extra costs by negotiating a deal either with the Trump Administration or the suppliers it works with.It wouldn't be the first time Apple tried to cut a deal under pressure. The tech giant is known to take on an assertive approach in its negotiations, and it's been successful in many instances.\"This is kind of their lobbying apparatus that kicks in and tries to convince the administration for whatever reason they should not be subject to it,\" Chaterjee said.Trump previously praised Apple CEO Tim Cook for his dealmaking approach. Trump said that during his first-term, Cook reached out to him when a 25% and 50% tariff would impact Apple products imported from China. The two ended up making a deal that Trump would back down from the tariffs if Apple manufactured more in the US.The sooner, the betterEven if Apple can't dodge the tariffs this time around, price hikes to its products likely won't happen overnight.Emarketer analyst Bourne said that Apple could potentially get by on months on emergency shipments of iPhones that it flew in ahead of tariffs to avoid some of the impact. Willcox, from Consumer Reports, said pricing will also depend on how much inventory Apple has, and how fast it ends up selling it. In the last week of March, the tech giant reportedly transported five planes of iPhones and other products from India to the US, The Times of India reported on Tuesday.Bourne said if a buyer has less urgency for a new iPhone, they could hedge their bets and hold off on a purchase until tariffs and negotiations are finalized.That said, if you know you'll need a new iPhone soon, it's not a bad idea to act now.Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson told BI that Apple isn't expected to drop anything \"Earth shaking\" with the iPhone 17. So buyers \"might as well jump now to get ahead of any price increase risk.\" Plus, it's not a bad time to lock in a phone deal, Moffett said, with Verizon offering a free phone deal and three year price guarantee.Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider Some analysts predict some iPhone models will increase in price by $350.Michael M.

        "description": "A lot of debate has arisen over President Trump’s array of tariffs and how that could impact Apple. Many fear that the obvious result would be the price of devices going up severalfold. Now, a new report from media giant The Wall Street Journal is sharing the most probable outcome that might arise. They’re also digging down deep to determine how much it really costs the company to produce iPhone 16 Pro and how that could alter, thanks to the tariffs rolled out by Trump.The latest report crafted the costs encountered by Apple to design the iPhone 16 Pro featuring 256GB of storage. The total involving the battery, Pro Chip, display, storage, rear camera, main enclosure, memory, and other parts gives a grand total of $549 before Trump’s tariffs were shared. We must add how that does not take into account matters like development and research, marketing, and other costs that aren’t related to hardware for the tech giant. When those do get factored, the WSJ shared how the profit margin for the Cupertino firm is still huge.Currently, Apple charges $1099 for its 256GB variant of the iPhone 16 Pro. Remember, the parts do come from different places around the globe, but the final assembly arrives in China before they are shipped to America. Trump shared how the 54% tax on all Chinese goods would be implemented soon. So it’s Apple that would be paying that on the total expenses of all the parts, not the retail cost, which is $1099. The 54% tariffs would mean the iPhone 16 Pro would now cost $847, which is a major hit in the face for the profit margin. This is when you take into consideration various other factors like packaging, shipping, and research. For now, the iPhone maker isn’t commenting on how it wishes to respond to the tariffs. The company isn’t likely to take the entire 54% tariff, which means consumers will pay a higher price for products in the end.Some asked if making iPhones in the US would be a viable or better option. As per experts, it’s not clear if anyone can design a competitively priced product in the US. Only assembly labor would cost $30 per device in China, but in the US, it would be nearly $300. So in case you’re in the mood to buy your dream iPhone, do it now because later might not be an option. The same goes for other leading Apple products like AirPods, chargers, power banks, smart watch, and more.

        "description": "The E2E encryption battle involving the UK government and Apple is one that many assumed would stay hidden for quite some time now. As shared by the British Broadcasting Corporation recently, that won’t be the case as tribunal judges rejected the government’s decision to keep all details about the matter hidden. They claim it would be extraordinary to carry out a hearing that’s a complete secret without any form of revelation to the public, making them unaware that such a hearing was really taking place.The entire fiasco began in February of this year when the British government forced iPhone maker Apple into developing a backdoor for iCloud encryption. Instead of following that order, the Cupertino firm chose to get rid of its Advanced Data Protection service in the country. Other domains for this iCloud data continue to stay E2E encrypted like health, payments, and passwords, including all iMessages and FaceTime. With this, the iPhone maker couldn’t publicly acknowledge the issue of demands coming out from the UK under the latest law.Apple went to the courts to file a complaint to the Powers Tribunal and sought to challenge the country’s order to break encryption for certain special cases. That secretive hearing started last month, even though a lot of pressure was on to make it go public.Many arguments arose about how it would be threatening to national security if the details went public about the legal action. As per the BBC, this argument wasn’t able to withstand scrutiny. The latest ruling on this front was shared yesterday, where tribunal judges refused the request. They shared how media reporting and highlighting of these principles were necessary for justice.It would be a massive step to carry out such hearings as a whole in private without the public knowing that such a matter actually took place. For the reasons outlined in the private judgment, they don’t accept such revelations of how baring the details could be damaging to the public or a threat to national security. So now, the public can expect to see more light being shed on the matter soon.

        "description": "The markets are crashing, businesses large and small are worried about their future, and the world is increasingly looking toward a global recession. But most people I talk to about this chaotic economic landscape want to know one thing: “How much is my next iPhone going to cost?” They are asking for a very good reason: The predominant countries where Apple makes many of its products—China and Vietnam (and to a lesser extent, India)—are the ones being hit the hardest by President Donald Trump’s tariffs at sky-high rates of 54%, 46%, and 26%, respectively. This means that if the tariffs stick there’s a very good chance iPhone prices may rise. But by how much? And could Apple find a way to avoid price hikes? Let’s look at some possibilities. Will an iPhone soon become 54% more expensive? First, it’s important to note that this article is purely speculative. It’s impossible to predict the future—and the Trump administration’s economic policies could change in the days and weeks to come. Second, estimating how much more an iPhone might soon cost in America if the tariffs do remain in place depends on numerous variables, including the country of origin for each part and where it is assembled (such as China or Vietnam), along with other factors. Still, with those caveats in mind, let’s dive in. For the basis of this thought exercise, let’s say that every iPhone comes from China, and the Trump administration ends up sticking that 54% tariff on an iPhone when it comes into America. If that’s the case, then I have some good-ish news for you: Your iPhone probably won’t be 54% more expensive. That’s because, as FreightWaves noted last November, tariffs are applied to the declared value of the goods when they enter the country—not to the final retail value. When Apple imports a 256GB iPhone 16 Pro from China into the U.S., it doesn’t declare its value to be its final U.S. retail price of $1,099. Apple is very tight-lipped about the cost of the individual parts that go into an iPhone, but several companies have put estimates on it. For example, The Wall Street Journal recently said that according to research analysts at TechInsights, a 256GB iPhone 16 Pro’s parts cost Apple around $550 in total. Let’s say that that’s roughly in the ballpark. If Trump hit that iPhone with a 54% tariff, assuming the entirety of the phone and its parts came from China, then Apple would need to pay the U.S. government around $297, which is 54% of $550. If Apple wanted to fully recoup that $297 cost exclusively from the U.S. consumer, it would add that amount to the iPhone 16 Pro’s existing retail price. This would mean that the 256GB iPhone 16 Pro would rise from today’s price of $1,099 to $1,396. That represents a significant price increase of approximately 27% from the consumer’s perspective. While it’s not anywhere close to 54%, it is more than a quarter more expensive than the current iPhone model. Of course, this is just one estimate for one iPhone model. Others have suggested some iPhone models could be up to 43% more expensive if Apple were to pass the costs of the tariffs on to customers. The good news is that Apple doesn’t have to pass that cost on to the end buyer. Apple has options to keep iPhone prices down Many companies, particularly small and midsize ones, often have limited options for dealing with tariffs. They generally have one of three choices: The first is to maintain retail prices and absorb the cost of the tariff themselves. This approach would satisfy customers and likely not result in a direct drop in sales, but it could negatively impact the company’s profit margins and bottom lines—which could make continuing to operate financially unfeasible. The second is to pass the cost of the tariff on to consumers by incorporating the tariff cost into the retail price. This would allow the company to maintain its current profit margins, but the increased costs of its goods could alienate customers and result in reduced sales, ultimately leading to a worse bottom line. A third is a hybrid of the two: absorbing some of the tariff costs while also passing a portion of the costs on to customers. This approach requires a delicate balance and could still impact profit margins and alienate customers, ultimately leading to a decrease in the bottom line. Apple has all three options available. However, the company also possesses a few additional choices—simply because it is so large, powerful, and wealthy—that most small and midsize businesses do not. As noted by respected TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple could pressure its suppliers in Asia to reduce the prices they charge the iPhone maker. Why would Apple’s suppliers be willing to take the tariff hit? Because Apple is likely their biggest customer—one they want to keep for decades to come. Those suppliers may be willing to endure a short- to medium-term financial loss if it keeps Apple happy in the long term. Kou also notes that Apple could move more of its production away from China to Vietnam and India, which face lower tariffs (although not significantly lower in Vietnam’s case). More importantly, those countries are more likely to negotiate new trade agreements with the Trump administration faster than China. So, what will Apple do? The only thing I can say with any kind of reasonable certainty is that if you are thinking of buying an iPhone, you should do it sooner rather than later if you want to lock in today’s prices. The Times of India reports that Apple spent the last week of March flying planes full of iPhones from India to the U.S. to beat Trump’s tariffs, which take effect on April 9. Because those iPhones made it into the U.S. before the tariffs took effect, Apple will still be able to sell them at today’s retail price without needing to take the tariff hit. But those planeloads of iPhones are only going to last so long. Any iPhones imported after April 8 will be subject to tariffs—meaning Apple may subject the iPhone to price hikes a short time later.",

Apple’s plans for dealing with the U.S. tariffs imposed on China — which is at the center of the company’s supply chain — reportedly include sending more iPhones made in India to supply the U.S. market. The company is doing so because while the tariffs announced by the Trump administration impose a 26% rate on goods from India, they place at least a 54% rate on those from China, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (April 7), citing unnamed sources. About 50% of American demand for iPhones could be met with devices made in India, according to the report. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company is also attempting to get an exemption from the tariffs, as it did during the first Trump administration, the WSJ report said. Making the products in the U.S. — which is the stated goal of the new tariffs for all goods — is a “nonstarter” because that would be much more expensive than paying the tariff, per the report. Bloomberg reported Monday that Apple stocked up on inventory ahead of the tariffs as part of its efforts to prepare for their arrival, which should delay the impact of the tariffs until into the next quarter. Apple is also likely to squeeze its suppliers and lower its margins in order to keep the prices of its iPhones from soaring, the report said, adding that the company has kept the starting price of its flagship device at $999 since 2017. In the meantime, consumers’ concerns that tariffs may cause a surge in iPhone prices sent them racing to Apple stores this weekend, leading to crowds like those normally seen during the holiday shopping season, per the report. Apple was among the companies that took the biggest hits to their stock price on Thursday (April 3), the day after the new tariffs were announced. The drop seen by the company and others like Nike and Wayfair was due to their dependence on imports. The decline in shares of Apple erased $300 billion from the company’s market cap, largely because of the iPhone maker’s overseas production hubs.

        "description": "As the European Union looks at how best to respond to Donald Trump’s trade war, officials are considering further escalating things, taking them to a point where it could really hurt Big Tech companies. Sophie Primas, a spokesperson for the French government, said the EU is deciding on its response to Trump’s blanket tariffs that would include not just tech goods, but tech services as well, an area where the U.S. enjoys a massive trade surplus. That would potentially target companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and X. Apple is already under pressure as tariffs on imported goods will likely result in higher prices for the company’s products, such as the iPhone and iPad, but Microsoft’s stock has largely escaped the drubbing other tech companies have seen on Wall Street since Trump announced the tariffs. (Shares are down just 5% in the past five days vs. 10% for Nvidia and 18% for Apple.) That’s because Microsoft’s chief products are software and services, such as cloud storage and Microsoft 365. Should the EU place tariffs on those, it would cause more pain for tech companies, which are already sore after a series of tariff-inspired body blows in recent days. Other examples of tech services include Google’s ad and cloud network; Meta’s ad network as well as the Quest (and digital store); Apple’s Music, Arcade and TV+ offerings; Amazon’s Web Services and Prime loyalty program; and X’s AI offering and planned financial services unit. The nuclear option The EU, it’s important to note, has not imposed these reciprocal tariffs yet. On Monday, the European Commission said it had offered a “zero-for-zero” tariff proposal to Washington. Michal Baranowski, deputy economy minister of Poland, following a meeting by the Commission Monday, said EU officials did not want to be “trigger-happy.” (Elon Musk has espoused a similar zero tariff proposal, in a video call to Italy’s right-wing, co-ruling League Party.) The White House has, so far, shrugged off talk of “zero tariffs,” with Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade advisor who is seen as the architect of the tariff plan, dismissing Musk as a “car assembler” that relies on parts from other countries. “When it comes to tariffs and trade, we all understand in the White House—and the American people understand—that Elon is a car manufacturer, but he’s not a car manufacturer. He’s a car assembler,” Navarro said. “He’s a car person. That’s what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.” Should the Trump administration refuse to deal, which has not yet been discussed, EU officials said nothing was off the table, though there appears to be different schools of thought among members about whether placing a tariff on services would be wise. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Harris said doing so would be “very much the nuclear option.” The likelihood of putting tariffs on services is part of what the EU calls the anti-coercion instrument (ACI). Adopted in 2023, it was designed to defend the EU against a trade war with China, but now it’s being seen as a tool to battle Trump, if necessary. Some EU officials refer to it as the “bazooka”. The ACI has wide ranging potential powers. It can be used to limit American banks’ access to certain EU markets or it “could also increase tax and regulatory pressure on American digital platforms,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen last week. Talk that the EU could be considering a tariff on services from U.S tech companies comes as the market continues to show extreme volatility. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw trading range from 36,705 to 39,198- a nearly 2,500-point swing.",

Waltz publicly claimed that Goldberg's number was \"sucked in\" to his phone and added to a different person's contact information without his knowledge. A report published yesterday by The Guardian said a forensic review by the White House IT office \"found that Waltz's phone had saved Goldberg's number as part of an unlikely series of events that started when Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign last October.\" The Guardian reported:Read full article Comments",

OpenAI has reportedly considered acquiring a startup connected to its CEO. Sam Altman had teamed with former Apple designer Jony Ive’s studio to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered personal device. According to a report Sunday (April 6) by The Information, OpenAI has in recent weeks weighed a deal that could include a team of engineers at work on the device at the startup, known as io Products. The report says that OpenAI at one point considered a purchase price of at least $500 million. Among the designs for io Products’ AI device are a “phone” with no screen and AI-enabled household devices, the report adds. However, these designs are still in their infancy and have yet to be finalized. The Information notes that this acquisition would add to OpenAI’s rapidly expanding product stable, which include AI software that can control users’ web browsers, AI server chips, and humanoid robots. In addition, this could help OpenAI get its technology in front of more consumers while also placing it in stiffer competition with Apple, one of its key AI partners, the report adds. PYMNTS has contacted OpenAI for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. News that Altman and Ive were at work on an AI device first surfaced in the autumn of 2023. As PYMNTS wrote at the time, the two appeared to be trying to recreate the success of the iPhone and App store with AI. “Apple’s business model has always emphasized a tight integration between hardware and software,” that report said. “This approach allowed Apple to control both the device and the operating system, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience, as well as facilitating the rise of subscription-based pricing models for apps and content, allowing users to pay on a recurring basis for access to premium services or content.” In other OpenAI news, last week saw reports that billions of dollars in the company’s funding was contingent on its plan to restructure into a for-profit entity. The startup is finalizing a $40 billion funding round that includes a condition that if it fails to complete that restructuring by the close of the year, the round could be scaled back by $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. Another report, this one from CNBC, said the provision would reduce the funding round by $10 billion, from $40 billion to $30 billion. The restructuring requires the approval of both its largest shareholder, Microsoft, and the California attorney general. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Elon Musk — who helped launch the company — attempting to halt the restructuring. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Apple has reportedly decided to keep TikTok in its App Store for at least 75 more days. This decision came after the tech giant got a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi telling the company it should adhere to President Donald Trump’s executive order that will extend the pause on a U.S. TikTok ban, Bloomberg News reported Sunday (April 6), citing sources familiar with the matter. The letter apparently arrived Saturday (April 5), the same day the White House had set as a deadline for TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the video sharing app. PYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. Trump had said he expected a deal to be struck before the deadline, with a variety of players — ranging from Amazon to groups of private equity investors — in the mix. The new agreement being hammered out would have give new outside investors 50% of TikTok’s U.S. business in a unit that would be spun off from ByteDance, Bloomberg reported. ByteDance’s existing U.S. investors would also own around 30% of the business, reducing ByteDance’s stake to just under 20%. Then came the latest round of U.S. tariffs on overseas products, including 54% duties on Chinese imports, leading ByteDance to back away. Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,” leading him to authorize the 75-day extension. Apple had restored TikTok in February after Bondi sent a similar letter offering the same reassurances. That followed a ban that went into effect earlier in the year, stemming from a law passed due to national-security-related concerns about TikTok’s Chinese ownership. Trump had initially supported banning TikTok — it was something he pushed for during his first presidency — but reversed his position last year, lobbying for a solution even after the Supreme Court ruled against ByteDance in trying to quash the ban. Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about Amazon’s push to become TikTok’s new owner, arguing something that would give the eCommerce giant a powerful tool for influencing consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics. “Moreover, such an acquisition could allow Amazon to integrate TikTok’s influential advertising ecosystem into its own retail infrastructure, providing a seamless link between content discovery and direct purchasing,” the report added. “While the deal remains speculative, it highlights Amazon’s willingness to pursue unconventional strategies to remain at the forefront of consumer engagement.” The post Apple Reportedly Keeping TikTok in Store Following AG’s Reassurance appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Even when you account for Apple’s advertising budget and all the included services — iMessage, iCloud, etc. — there’s still a healthy profit margin.

        "description": "Keeping our inboxes organized often feels like an overwhelming task. If you’re fortunate, yours contains only messages from people you wish to communicate with. Realistically, though, most are cluttered with newsletters, receipts, social media digests, and more. These emails aren’t necessarily spam, but they complicate the process of quickly sifting through to find the messages we want to see. This week, Apple introduced a feature to the Mac that aims to help cut through inbox clutter by automatically organizing messages into smart categories. The feature is new in the Mail app in macOS 15.4 and comes several months after Apple debuted the feature on the iPhone in iOS 18.2. Here’s how to use it. As of this week, the new Mail categories features are available on all Macs, iPhones, and iPads that are capable of running the latest operating systems. That’s macOS 15.4, iOS 18.2, and iPadOS 18.2 and later. The central concept behind Mail categories is that it uses on-device processing—meaning Apple is not reading anything—to sort your emails into five categories: Primary: Signified by a blue banner, this category displays personal messages to you as well as any messages with time-sensitive information (like a flight change notice). Transactions: Signified by a green banner, this category displays emails that contain receipts, such as from Amazon, shipping notices, and confirmations. Updates: Signified by a purple banner, this category contains all your newsletters, social media roundup digests, and more. Promotions: Signified by a pink banner, this category contains emails that relate to advertisements, such as an email from Target drawing your attention to its upcoming sale. All Mail: Signified by a black banner, this category shows you every email in your inbox in chronological order, including those from the categories above. By clicking or tapping on any of the category banners, you will quickly see all the emails that fit into that category displayed in your inbox. This can help decrease the time it takes you to find the email you’re looking for and eliminate the need to sort your emails yourself. As excited as many people are about Apple’s new Mail categories feature, it’s worth noting that Apple isn’t exactly innovating here. Google’s Gmail has offered automatic email categorization for years. How to use Apple’s new Mail category feature The best thing about Apple’s new Mail category feature on Mac, iPhone, and iPad is that it’s pretty much automatic. Once you have the email app set up to display categories, Apple’s email client will do everything. The new categories feature is part of the Mac’s built-in email client, Mail. To make sure your Mail app is set up to display categories, do the following: On your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, select the inbox you want to display categories for. Now select the three-dots button (…). On Mac, tap “Show Mail Categories”; and on iPhone and/or iPad, tap “Categories.” You will now see a new button bar above your inbox with five buttons, each featuring a unique icon: a person (Primary), a shopping cart (Transactions), a word balloon (Updates), a megaphone (Promotions), and a drawer (All Mail). Select any of the buttons to quickly see the emails that are sorted into the respective categories. Easily reassign emails into other categories Apple also knows that some people may prefer to have emails from certain senders appear in a category other than the one Mail has assigned. That’s why the company also allows users to manually change the category designation for emails from the same sender. The feature is also available on the iPhone and iPad. For example, if you would prefer that the emails you receive from your local movie theater be sorted into the Promotions category instead of the Updates category, you can automatically reassign it. Here’s how: On Mac, right-click on the email, select Categorize Sender, and then select the category you desire. On iPhone and iPad, tap on the email and then tap the three dots (…) at the top of the email. Select “Categorize Sender” from the dropdown menu, and then select the category you desire. One nice thing about the new Mail category feature is that it is not part of Apple Intelligence, which means it is not limited to Macs, iPhones, and iPads that can run Apple Intelligence. As long as your Mac can run macOS Sequoia and your iPhone and iPad can run iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, respectively, you can take advantage of the new Mail categorization features right now. Of course, it’s worth noting that not everyone may like the new Mail categorization feature. And if you’re one of them, there’s an easy way to turn it off. Simply go to your inbox and select the three dots button (…). On Mac, click “Show Mail Categories” so the checkmark next to it disappears. On iPhone and iPad, tap “List View” and the Categories feature will be hidden.",

For Apple, the 54% tariff rate on China and a 46% tariff on Vietnam present a challenge: analysts estimate the vast majority of its product line is made in the two countries.If things continue as they are now, Apple is on track to face $40 billion in tariff costs, Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note. The tech giant will have to decide if it will try to offset the fees by raising iPhone prices.Crockett and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predict a roughly 40% price increase on tech devices to ease the impact of the tariffs. iPhones could get more expensive at the same time that Apple is pushing for more demand. Apple shares were down more than 8% at market close following Trump's announcement — its largest one-day drop in five years.Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.The iPhone 16 starts at $799. A 43% price increase, as Rosenblatt estimated, would bring it up to $1,142 before taxes — $50 cheaper than the most expensive iPhone in Apple's current lineup. For the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max, which costs up to $1,599, a 43% bump would put it at just under $2,300, according to BI's calculations.Shifting production to the US likely won't save consumers either, Ives said. He estimates that an iPhone made in the US would cost $3,500. However, Crockett wrote that the shift isn't feasible for the immediate future.China swiftly clapped back at Trump's tariffs with its own on Friday.

Fast-growing hubs in Apple's supply chain, including India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, were hit with tariffs well above Trump's 10% global baseline rate.Though Apple secured an exemption from the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term, there are no signs yet that Apple will be able to secure a similar exemption this time. Apple's market capitalization fell to $3 trillion, wiping almost nine months of gains.Trump's tariffs add further woes to Apple, which has faced a difficult few months as investor concerns over iPhone sales and future bets such as Apple Intelligence and the Vision Pro have weighed on its stock. Shares are down more than 16% year-to-date.The tariff plans have raised concerns among analysts about the potential hit to consumer demand for iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and other Apple products if the company decides to raise prices to counter the spiraling costs it would face from tariffs.Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at investment bank Raymond James, wrote in a research note published Thursday that Apple would \"need to raise US hardware prices by about 30%, all else equal,\" to fully offset the tariff impact on earnings per share.If the company chooses not to raise prices, analysts forecast a significant hit to its profit margins, which have long been prized by investors.Apple was not the only tech company whose shares took a hit on Thursday, with Nvidia down about 7.8% and Tesla down about 5.5%. The Dow Jones Index closed down nearly 4%, while the S&P was down over 4.8%.

Shares are down more than 16% year-to-date.The tariff plans have raised concerns among analysts about the potential hit to consumer demand for iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and other Apple products if the company decides to raise prices to counter the spiraling costs it would face from tariffs.Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at investment bank Raymond James, wrote in a research note published Thursday that Apple would \"need to raise US hardware prices by about 30%, all else equal,\" to fully offset the tariff impact on earnings per share.If the company chooses not to raise prices, analysts forecast a significant hit to its profit margins, which have long been prized by investors.Apple was not the only tech company whose shares took a hit on Thursday, with Nvidia down about 7.8% and Tesla down about 5.5%. The Dow Jones Index closed down nearly 4%, while the S&P was down over 4.8%. Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "The Apple ATT backlash has arrived. In a ruling that could rattle the scaffolding of digital advertising, France’s competition authority has fined Apple €150 million ($162 million) for what it deems an antitrust violation disguised as privacy reform. At the heart of the matter is Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework, the marquee feature of its privacy push — hailed by some as a principled stand against surveillance capitalism and by others as a velvet-gloved power grab. The decision marks a rare European rebuke of Apple’s dominance and raises larger questions about who truly benefits from the era of so-called privacy. What follows is a closer look at the questions this decision surfaces — not just for Apple but for the entire advertising ecosystem built on the promise (and pretense) of privacy.Continue reading this article on digiday.com.

        "description": "Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced a slew of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—over 180 of them, notes CNBC. The tariffs Trump announced are higher than most economists and business leaders feared. Trump chose to hold off on announcing the tariffs until after the markets closed yesterday, and after seeing how those markets have since reacted, it’s easy to understand why. Individual stocks and the markets as a whole plummeted after the tariffs were revealed, and in premarket trading, those markets and stocks remain greatly depressed. Major American companies like Apple, Amazon, Nike, Tesla, and Walmart are seeing their share prices decline this morning, while Nasdaq, Dow, and S&P futures have fallen significantly. President Trump’s tariffs explained Trump’s tariffs were announced yesterday on a day the president coined “Liberation Day.” Business leaders, economists, and global heads of state were on edge before the announcements, fearing just how high the tariffs would be. It turns out, in many cases, they were worse than expected. President Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on nearly every country worldwide. That means that nearly every good that is imported into the United States will be slapped with a default 10% levy—a levy which will then either have to be absorbed by the U.S. company importing the product, leading to reduced profits, or passed on to American consumers, leading to increased prices. However, countries that were only hit with a 10% tariff could count themselves relatively lucky. That’s because Trump levied much higher tariffs against dozens of countries, which are also the countries from which American companies import most of their goods and parts. Here are some of the countries that got hit the hardest with high tariff rates: China: 54% Cambodia: 49% Vietnam: 46% Bangladesh: 37% Thailand: 36% Taiwan: 32% South Africa: 30% India: 26% Japan: 24% European Union (27 member states): 20% There are two big omissions from the list of key trading partners above: Canada and Mexico. Trump did not announce new tariffs on either country yesterday, but previous tariffs imposed on both nations remain in place, notes Reuters. Reactions from global leaders to the swatch of new tariffs have been vocal and swift. Many condemned Trump’s tariffs and vowed to retaliate in kind, leading to fears that an all-out global tariff war is about to begin. Foreign stock markets have already fallen today, but the worst fall may be yet to come when U.S. markets open in just a few hours. American stock markets—and tech shares—sink American investors are already not taking the news of Trump’s tariffs well. As of the time of this writing, America’s three largest stock markets are down a significant amount, according to data from Yahoo Finance: S&P 500 Futures: down 3.23% Dow Futures: down 2.57% Nasdaq Futures: down 3.6% But things are even worse for many big-name tech stocks. Here is how many of America’s largest tech giants’ shares have reacted as of the time of this writing: Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG): down 2.76% Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN): down 5.7% Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL): down 7.4% Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META): down 4.23% Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT): down 2.27% NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA): down 4.46% Shopify Inc. (Nasdaq: SHOP): down 10.13% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): down 4.84% Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA): down 4.86% As you can see, some tech stocks are being hit worse than others. Apple’s shares are among the worst hit. A significant reason for that is that Apple manufactures most of its products in China, Vietnam, and India—all countries that got hit with some of the most considerable tariffs. That means that Apple will either need to absorb those costs or increase prices for consumers. If Apple does the former, it will reduce the company’s margins and profitability. If it does the latter, fewer people may buy its products, reducing the company’s profitability. Likewise, NVIDIA and TSMC shares are among the biggest tech losers since their products rely on supplies from some of the hardest-hit countries, including China and Taiwan. As for Amazon, many of the goods the company sells—from tech to clothing—come from a number of the hardest-hit countries, including China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and more. Shopify is one of the hardest hit tech companies this morning, because many of the goods sellers on its platform offers originate from the countries that are hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs. As for Tesla, many of the components that go into its electric vehicles are sourced from overseas. Even tech giants that don’t generate too much of their revenue from selling physical goods imported from overseas—like Meta and Google—are seeing their share prices fall, because those companies rely on infrastructure made overseas, like servers, to keep their businesses going. Physical retailers and apparel makers see stock prices get hit, too But it’s not just America’s tech stocks that are getting hammered. Here is how many of America’s largest retailers and apparel makers’ shares are reacting: Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST): down 3.4% Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU): down 12.48% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE): down 9.6% Target Corporation (TGT): down 5.12% Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT): down 4.96% Much of the apparel Americans buy comes from countries like China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India—all of which were hit hard by Trump’s tariffs. It’s no wonder then that apparel makers, including Lululemon and Nike, are seeing some of the biggest share price drops today. And just as Amazon and Shopify are seeing large declines in their stock prices, America’s brick-and-mortar retailers are as well—again, due to the fact that they import many of their goods from the countries hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs. These retailers include Costco, Target, and Walmart. How will the tariffs affect me? Every American will likely be affected by Trump’s tariffs. This will primarily happen in two ways. First, Americans will likely see most of the goods they buy—from gadgets to food to clothing to cars—jump in price over the next days and weeks. This means Americans’ money will be able to buy less, and Americans with lower incomes will be hit harder than those with higher incomes because they already have less discretionary spending power. Second, as of this morning, many Americans who invest directly or indirectly in the stock market—whether through a brokerage account, 401 (k), or pension plan—will likely see their investments be hit. Those who don’t need to tap into these funds for years or decades may be able to ride out the tariff storm. But those older Americans who are or will be tapping into their investments in the coming weeks will, if the stock price declines today hold, see that their investments are worth less than they were before the tariffs went into effect. However, as poorly as the markets have already reacted after Trump’s tariff announcements yesterday, things could get even worse in the days ahead. That’s because we do not yet know how, exactly, other countries will respond. If they respond as strongly in kind—and it’s likely many will, including trading powerhouse China—then many experts fear that Trump’s tariff wars could lead to another global recession like the one the world has not seen since 2008.",

        "description": "A new study by security researchers is speaking about how iPhone farms are sending nearly 100,000 scam iMessages every single day. These farms are banks of devices filled with rotating temporary Apple IDs. Instead of texting, they use iMessages so scammers can bypass any kind of spam filters that might be in place on the user’s device. Moreover, these scammers don’t need any special skills to carry out such attacks in the first place. You can think of them as companies providing Phishing-As-A-Service (PhAAS), which is a special kind of phishing attack.Most of the scams taking place today entail false demands for tasks like traffic toll fees or shipping fees for packages arriving at the Customs. There are also fake warnings about any kind of unpaid tax.The majority of the scams are rolled out through email and texts, and then a common cat and mouse game takes place between one criminal to the next. There is also the arrival of mobile carriers who try to alert users about suspicious message transfers to block all of them.The news comes to us from research experts at Catalyst who say that scammers are switching to iMessage as they’re encrypted. Networks cannot see the material, so they aren’t ever blocked or highlighted.What makes the whole situation so much worse is how one platform from China is offering iPhone farms for sale that people can use by paying. For instance, one example is Lucid, which is operated by threat actors from China. They target 169 entities across 88 different nations around the globe.It’s all very scalable, and the subscription-based designs enable cybercriminals to carry out large-scale phishing attempts. These can harvest sensitive details like credit cards for matters like money fraud. To ensure it’s not caught, it makes use of Android RCS and Apple’s iMessage to get more support and acceptance. This will bypass all classic filters for spam and also improve better rates for deliver and success.Some scammers go all the way to produce convincing-looking alternatives to pages for organizations that seem so real, like a courier service. One group called the XinXin group was seen putting phishing templates on sale. These are created to copy postal services, tax refunds, and even road toll fee systems. There’s even a group on Telegram that sells PhAAS attacks that feature up to 2,000 different members. Experts warn to never clicking on these phishing links seen in emails. No matter how much you might be tempted to do so, it’s better to use personal bookmarks or add a known URL.It’s simpler to make emails or texts appear like they came from real companies, so we feel trusting anyone online is never advisable. If there’s any message asking for a quick acceptance or forcing you to act immediately to avoid a fee, there is something wrong here for sure.

It adds to an existing 20% tariff, meaning the effective tariff rate on the country is now 54%.China has long been its central hub for manufacturing and assembling everything from iPhones to MacBooks. Tariffs now threaten to raise the cost of Apple goods imported from the center of its supply chain universe.Although the sweeping tariffs are also set to hit other tech companies with sprawling supply chains — such as Tesla or Nvidia — it's a particularly big hit for Apple.Jamie MacEwan, senior analyst at Enders Analysis, previously told Business Insider he estimates that \"almost half of Apple's revenue is exposed to China through direct sales and the supply chain.\"It is also a blow to Cook, who has spent years trying to build a tight-knit relationship with Trump. The Apple CEO met the president for dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December, attended his inauguration in January, and pledged a $500 billion investment in the US in February.Apple has made moves in recent years to diversify its supply chain away from China in the face of geopolitical tensions, but Trump's levies appear to diminish even those efforts.The countries Apple has increasingly shifted manufacturing and assembly operations to — India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Ireland — have all been hit with tariffs above Trump's baseline 10% rate.Though Cook managed to secure an exemption for the company when Trump first escalated a tariff-led trade war in 2018, as things stand, Apple has no escape from the latest wave of tariffs.Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.The reality facing Apple is already being digested by markets. Apple shares were down 7.4% in premarket trading as investors triggered a panic sell-off over fears of the implications of Trump's plans.In a note, analysts at investment bank Citi wrote that \"if Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"Analysts at Jefferies, meanwhile, wrote in a Thursday note that in their worst-case scenario — one in which the 27 million iPhones made in China and imported to the US are subject to the 54% tariff — Apple's net profit for the fiscal year could be reduced by 14%.This all paints a less-than-pretty picture for Apple and, potentially, its consumers.

        "description": "iPhone maker Apple was just stuck with a mega $162 million fine by a leading French watchdog over the rollout of its ATT privacy framework. The penalty comes for abusing its monopoly position as a top distributor of mobile apps in the region after launching the App Tracking Transparency model. As per the Autorité de la concurrence, the Cupertino firm rolled this out in 2021 and carried on for all iOS and iPadOS devices until 2023. This feature forces mobile apps to get users’ explicit permission to access the phone’s unique ad identifier. Once that’s done, it can be tracked through different platforms and pages for the sake of targeted ads.Until they get permission, the device cannot track the user, and no revenue is generated in terms of identifier value and targeting. However, once the permission is received, it’s a whole other game where the company will benefit at the users’ tracking cost.App developers must also speak about the purpose behind why features like tracking are necessary, the French regulator shared. It’s not only about attaining consent. They also shared how the ATT model is not the main or core issue here, but the fact that there’s no transparency about the matter for users is where the real problem lies. How this ATT gets implemented is not important or proportionate, as Apple shared its objectives for why it wants to protect users’ personal information.Describing the ATT is mostly complex as the consent attained through such frameworks doesn’t meet the legal obligations needed under this law. It forces developers to use their own consent as solutions. This leads to several different consent pop-ups being put on display to all.One issue is that consent tracking needs to be shown and confirmed by all users more than once, and also that refusal should only be a one-step process. This would make such models more neutral and acceptable.Publishers were needed to attain double consent from people for tracking on third-party pages and apps. The iPhone maker didn’t ask for consent from people when it came down to its own apps. So this was another major loophole.There was also a discussion about how double consent is needed when it comes to the collection of data. However, when it comes to collecting user consent for Apple’s own data collection, it’s only done once, which was called unfair.It’s worth mentioning how this order doesn’t impose any kind of certain changes made to this framework. As per Reuters, it’s now the company that has to make sure that it’s complying with all the rulings. The fine is a major game changer for Apple, whose earnings hit $36B on a revenue of $124B in Q4 of last year.A statement that was shared with AP, the company explained how the ATT model is the same for all developers. It has attained support for this feature from different consumers, authorities for data protection, and privacy advocates around the globe.

        "description": "Apple rolled out its iOS 18.4 update yesterday, and mixed in with new notification tweaks, an expansion of Apple Intelligence features, and some changes to Photos, there’s a hidden gem that’s destined to become an enduring symbol of 2025. IOS 18.4 comes with eight new emoji, including a radish, fingerprint, purple paint splatter, harp, and, weirdly, the flag of Sark—an island off the coast of France which has a population of just over 500 (according to the blog Emojipedia, this last can be chalked up to a legal workaround.) But one of the new emoji stands out from the pack: “Face With Bags Under Eyes,” an expressive new “smiley” face. It’s about to be unavoidable on X, TikTok, and in group chats everywhere. “Face With Bags Under Eyes” is a beleaguered little guy with drooping lids, dark circles, lowered eyebrows, and a mouth represented by a single straight line. It has the kind of resigned expression of someone who’s well past their limit, but is still soldiering on. It’s an elementary school teacher who’s “not mad, just disappointed.” It’s a corporate worker who’s opened his Outlook inbox to 47 unread emails. It’s a parent returning home to find a sink full of dishes. It’s all of us. And in an era when scrolling through X, buying eggs, or checking Zillow for local home prices can foster enough existential dread that smashing your laptop and fleeing the country feels like the only option left, “Face With Bags Under Eyes” is not just an emoji—he’s also a sign of the times. Under a tweet revealing iOS 18.4’s new emoji, one commenter predicted, “I bet this is the most used emoji of the year. 3 months into 2025 and everyone is already tired.” Another user added, “Never thought they’d approve an emoji of me in Unicode.” And a third managed to sum up how we all feel about the update: “God this is me rn.” The new emojis, included this extremely usable haggard one, are available now.",

        "description": "It’s telling that the plot premise of the first episode for the new Apple show The Studio—episode three drops today—revolves entirely around the notion of a Kool-Aid movie. Created by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the entire show revolves around the elevation of Rogen’s character Matt Remick to studio head, a job he got only because he committed to getting into bed with the brand IP of a 98-year-old beverage. How the premiere episode subsequently ties in Martin Scorcese and a film about Jonestown to the Kool-Aid brand is both hilariously absurd and somehow absolutely believable. Speaking of believable, watch the scene in which filmmaker Nick Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Captain Underpants, Neighbors) pitches Remick his Kool-Aid script idea and tell me it couldn’t be hitting theaters next summer. There is a scene in the first episode that undoubtedly had marketers of all stripes howling with laughter and cringing with recognition. It takes place in a boardroom of the fictional film studio Continental Studios, in which newly promoted Remick tells the studio’s head of marketing (played by Kathryn Hahn) that they will be making a movie based on Kool-Aid brand IP. “Let’s fucking go!” exclaims Hahn’s character, holding a giant Stanley cup. “I could sell the fuck out of that!” Kathryn Hahn and Chase Sui Wonders [Photo: Apple TV+] We then get a very short, yet incredibly accurate, summary of the current tension in Hollywood when it comes to brand IP. Remick details why Barbie was successful. “It had Greta Gerwig, a writer-director behind it,” he says. “It had a filmmaker’s vision. That’s what we’re going to do with Kool-Aid. We’re going to make the auteur-driven, Oscar-winning Kool-Aid film.” Hahn’s character groans. “Oh fuck me, you want to make a fucking fancy Kool-Aid movie?” she says. “Why? Nobody even fucking watches the Oscars anymore. Did Mario Bros win an Oscar? No, it didn’t. But you know what it did win? $1.3 billion.” Rogen said last week on the podcast Armchair Expert that prior to writing the show, he and Goldberg interviewed just about every studio head, and their heads of marketing. As profanely hysterical as this show is, its depiction of the relationship between Hollywood, marketing, and brands is rooted in an immediately recognizable reality. I spoke to sources that include execs and creatives who work across brands and entertainment, studio marketers, and yes, Kool-Aid parent Kraft Heinz, to see just how recognizable it really is. Here are three things The Studio gets right. [Photo: Apple TV+] The Marketer Kathryn Hahn is both brilliant and brilliantly over-the-top, but her character’s role in the studio decision making process is illustrated perfectly. The modern studio marketer is now a part of the project approval process for films, given the ongoing challenges of getting our attention and convincing us to actually go to the movie theaters. But just as Remick initially ignores her advice, the marketers are also at the mercy of those above them in the studio food chain. In his Armchair Expert interview, Rogen said (starting around 50-minute mark), even though the marketer is on the greenlight committee, “Often they get directly overruled,” he said. “They would say, ‘We should not make this movie! We cannot sell it!’ And then they’re told (by studio execs) ‘Guess what, we made it anyway and if it fails you’re the one who’s going to get fired.’ That was just a really funny dynamic to have in the show.” Of course, sometimes that dynamic works incredibly well. Back in 2023, I spoke to Universal’s CMO Michael Moses about Cocaine Bear, which went on to make $88 million worldwide on a $35 million budget. Moses’ department helped boost the hype around that film by making fun social posts like the bear snorting the chalk lines of the football field, and creating a 8-bit, Pac-Man-style online game called The Rise of Pablo Escobear. Rogen told the podcast that the studio marketers he spoke to view themselves as more creative than the executives. “They’re like, ‘We actually make stuff. We create things. We’re making commercials, content, posters, we’re thinking of little ads, while these guys (execs) are just sitting in rooms and giving notes,” said Rogen. Studio marketers I spoke to on background told me that the show has been a hot topic in their office hallways. They said that the balance between how recognizable and farcical it is, is a ton of fun, and they love Hahn’s sweatily trendy marketer and her willingness to tell the truth. Bryan Cranston [Photo: Apple TV+] The Brand Tension Patient zero of Hollywood’s latest Great Brand IP Experiment is obviously Barbie, and the iconic doll subsequently catches some hilariously vulgar strays in The Studio. While the hype around brands and Hollywood is very real, there is really a small number of companies like Superconnector Studios, ACE Content, and Modern Arts that have been able to bridge the two in a meaningful and consistent way. Modern Arts cofounder and cochief creative officer Zac Ryder says The Studio’s first episode nails how hungry Hollywood is for IP that it believes audiences already know and love. “And I think it nails how hungry brands are to be part of pop culture in a real way,” says Ryder. “Now more than ever, they need each other if they’re going to survive. There’s a sense of desperation to the episode, which I think is spot on.” In the wake of Barbie’s success back in 2023, Mattel announced plans for more IP-driven film projects that sound straight out of The Studio—like a Polly Pocket movie directed by Lena Dunham, or a Barney movie produced by Daniel Kaluuya. Dunham dropped out of the former last year, but Mattel confirmed to Fast Company earlier this month the film is still in development. The Barney project is very much in progress, written by Ayo Edebiri and co-developed and produced by A24. This sounds straight from the Remick playbook. Ryder says a lot of studio execs still think of brands as a blank check. “That a brand will just go along with anything for an opportunity to be involved in a project,” he says. “The connection between Kool-Aid and the Jonestown massacre is an insanely far fetched, hilarious example. But I do think there’s some truth to it.” However, as evidenced in the dramatically slowing pace of brand IP projects being announced since the initial Barbie afterglow, that attitude towards brands has evolved. “There are a lot more executives and producers in the business who see the value a brand can bring to the table, especially when it comes to marketing and understanding an audience,” says Ryder. Ryder says there are insights for brand marketers watching The Studio. “Make sure you aren’t just getting your brand involved in a project because you want to tell people about your movie at a cocktail party,” he says. “Be very clear and very intentional with what you want the brand to get out of the deal. Also, know what you bring to the table. In many ways, the studios need you more than you need them.” Martin Scorsese [Photo: Apple TV+] The Kool-Aid Movie While Martin Scorcese’s repurposed Jonestown film is so very clearly miles over the line, Stoller’s treatment is entirely believable. Superconnector Studios cofounder Jae Goodman says that its believability extends beyond the fictional world of The Studio. “Despite the hilarity of the brand’s role in the studio, no chance any reasonable brand manager stays officially connected to the studio once the Jonestown idea appears,” says Goodman. “If the storyline veers away from Scorcese’s Jonestown, then I think there’s an opportunity down the line to do an actual Seth-and-Evan-led Kool Aid movie.” One thing that nagged me while watching this episode was just how visible and upfront Kool-Aid was in all the jokes. The iconic Kool-Aid Man character even makes an appearance in a quick TIKTok dance diversion created by Hahn’s marketing team. Could the real Kool-Aid brand actually be involved here? Sources close with the brand and its parent Kraft Heinz say that Rogen and Goldberg did approach the brand, including sharing scripts and rough edits, in the hopes Kool-Aid would be officially involved. Obviously, the Jonestown plotline and jokes got in the way of that. But sources also said that Kraft Heinz has been in discussions with Apple to explore potential paths forward. While the show’s portrayal of Kool-Aid may not always align with its brand ethos, the company recognizes the value in having its brands in the cultural zeitgeist. It’s refreshing to see that a brand has enough self-awareness and confidence to not freak out over its portrayal in a subversive comedy. I’ve got a feeling that Kool-Aid isn’t the last IRL brand to get name-checked and more as the show goes on. As much as Mattel must be doing its best Lloyd Christmas impression while watching the show, do you think the folks at Kraft Heinz are cautiously optimistic for where all this could lead? Mr. Kool-Aid has a catchphrase for that.",

The offer came as the payment network and rival American Express are trying to win the Apple card business, and Mastercard is fighting to keep it, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (April 1), […] The post Report: Visa Offers $100 Million to Get Apple Credit Card Business appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Visa reportedly offered Apple about $100 million to get the tech giant’s credit card business, which is held by Mastercard. The offer came as the payment network and rival American Express are trying to win the Apple card business, and Mastercard is fighting to keep it, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (April 1), citing unnamed sources. Reached by PYMNTS, a Visa spokesperson said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. The Apple card business is in play because the bank behind it, Goldman Sachs, is exiting the consumer lending sector, according to the WSJ report. While Apple is looking for a new bank, it plans to select a payment network first, the report said. The payment networks are competing for the business because not only is Apple one of the biggest co-branded credit card programs — with about $20 billion in balances — but the company plays a growing role in many consumers’ payments and other financial needs, per the report. Apple debuted its credit card in 2019 in conjunction with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard, PYMNTS reported at the time. At launch, key features of the card included no fees, daily cash-back rewards, and the ability to sign up for the card with an iPhone in the Wallet app and get the card within minutes, issued straight to the phone. It was reported in July 2023 that Goldman Sachs’ credit card partnership with Apple could be nearing an end, and that the banking giant was in discussions with American Express to take over the credit card and other collaborations between Goldman and Apple. Goldman had announced plans in late 2022 to scale back its consumer banking offerings, though its agreement with Apple remained untouched at the time. In January, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Barclays and credit card issuer Synchrony Financial to replace Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said at the time that while the bank had a contract with Apple to run the partnership until 2030, there was a possibility that it could end before then. The bank was narrowing its strategic focus and exiting some businesses. The post Report: Visa Offers $100 Million to Get Apple Credit Card Business appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Apple only supported RCS on the big three carriers in the first iOS18 releases. Apple spent years ignoring RCS, allowing iPhones to offer a degraded messaging experience with Android users. This made Android folks unwelcome in many a group chat, but Apple finally started rectifying this issue last year with the addition of RCS support in iOS. It has been a slow rollout, though, with Google's mobile service only now getting support. While Apple supports RCS messaging on iPhones now, it has not exactly been enthusiastic about it. Anyone using Google Fi on an iPhone was left in the lurch even after Apple changed course. The first RCS update rolled out in iOS 18 last fall, but it only supported postpaid plans on the big three carriers. Everyone else was left waiting, including Google Fi, as confirmed to Ars last year. It was a suitably amusing outcome, considering Google is largely responsible for reviving the RCS standard and runs the Jibe back-end servers through which many iPhone RCS messages flow. Slowly but surely, Apple is making good on its promises to enable RCS. The company released iOS 18.4 this week, and hiding amid the control center tweaks and priority notifications is support for RCS on Google Fi and other T-Mobile MVNOs. Some users spotted this feature in the recent beta releases, but the servers that handle RCS for Google's mobile service were not yet connectable. With the final release, Google has confirmed that RCS is ready at last.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Updates bring new emoji, Mail organization for Macs, easier Mac setup, and more. Apple dropped a big batch of medium-size software updates for nearly all of its products this afternoon. The iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and visionOS 2.4 updates are all currently available to download, and each adds a small handful of new features for their respective platforms. A watchOS 11.4 update was also published briefly, but it's currently unavailable. For iPhones and iPads that support Apple Intelligence, the flagship feature in 18.4 is Priority Notifications, which attempts to separate time-sensitive or potentially important notifications from the rest of them so you can see them more easily. The update also brings along the handful of new Unicode 16.0 emoji, a separate app for managing a Vision Pro headset (similar to the companion app for the Apple Watch), and a grab bag of other fixes and minor enhancements.Read full article Comments",

France's competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that third-party applications use for targeted advertising. The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a press release today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms \"smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,\" the agency said. User consent obtained via the ATA framework \"authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes,\" the agency said. \"If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers ('IDFA'), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites.\" The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.Read full article Comments",

France’s competition regulator has fined Apple 150 million euros (about $162 million), alleging that the company’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) made the use of third-party applications in the iOS environment “excessively complex.” This complexity amounted to abuse of Apple’s dominant position in the distribution of mobile apps on iOS and iPadOS devices between April 2021 and July 2023, the Autorité de la concurrence said in a Monday (March 31) press release. “As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the Autorité found that while the objective of the App Tracking Transparency (‘ATT’) framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple’s stated objective of protecting personal data,” the release said. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company told Reuters, per a report posted Monday: “While we are disappointed with today’s decision, the French Competition Authority has not required any specific changes to ATT.” ATT, which Apple introduced in April 2021 with the launch of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, protects the privacy of users of iPhones and iPads by asking for their consent before allowing third-party applications downloaded from the App Store to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes, according to the French regulator’s press release. In October 2020, after Apple announced that it would introduce ATT, several associations representing players in the online advertising industry filed a complaint with the regulator, saying the technology would present an obstacle to targeted advertising, per the release. The regulator ruled that ATT is abusive in terms of competition law because it leads to multiple consent pop-ups being displayed, requires users to consent twice to advertising tracking but refuse only once, and, until the implementation of iOS 15, required users to consent only once to Apple’s data tracking but twice for third parties’ data collection, the release said. Apple told PYMNTS in July 2023 that ATT gives users added control by requiring apps to ask permission before tracking them. The company said it had received “strong support from regulators and privacy advocates on the goal of ATT,” and would continue to work to make sure users hold onto control of their data.

Apple is reportedly working on an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can dispense health advice. It’s all part of what the company has dubbed “Project Mulberry,” Apple’s latest — and perhaps strongest — push into the health field, Bloomberg News reported Sunday (March 30). According to that report, this project is an interaction of an earlier effort called “Project Quartz,” a health coaching service that would deploy AI to help users exercise, develop healthier eating and sleeping habits. Now, the project has ramped up development, the Bloomberg report said, with release possible as soon as Apple releases its iOS 19.4 operating system update, something that could happen in spring or summer of 2025. The idea, the report said, is to have the Health app collect data from devices, with the AI coach then offering users tailored recommendations on improving their health based on that data. Apple is also training an AI agent using data from doctors it has on staff, but is also looking to recruit outside doctors — such as experts in sleep, nutrition, physical therapy, mental health and cardiology — to create video explainers about different health conditions. The revamped app will also have a major focus on food tracking, an area that — per the Bloomberg report — Apple has mostly shied away from. Such a move would mean going head-to-head with companies like MyFitnessPal and Noom, the report added. As Bloomberg noted, Apple’s health efforts have run into roadblocks in the past. For example, the company last year decided to remove a blood oxygen feature from its smartwatch following a yearslong patent dispute with medical technology firm Masimo. In other news from the intersection of AI and healthcare, a new PYMNTS Intelligence report — “Healthcare Firms Going Long on GenAI Investment” — finds that investments in this technology are yielding returns, leading to a wave of additional adoption by major players. The report is based on surveys of C-suite executives at healthcare firms with at least $1 billion in yearly revenue, with the goal of understanding their generative AI (GenAI) strategies. “The findings indicate a strong conviction in the technology’s potential, with 9 in 10 executives anticipating a positive return on their GenAI investments,” PYMNTS wrote. “Consequently, a majority of these leaders plan to further escalate their GenAI spending in the coming year, placing healthcare ahead of the cross-industry average in its bullish outlook. The report highlights the strategic prioritization of GenAI in crucial operational areas as businesses strive to stay competitive.

        "description": "Have you ever wanted to sign up for an online service but you didn’t want to provide your real email address as part of the process? There’s a good chance your email address has your actual name in it. Or perhaps you want to avoid the risk of getting spammed. What if you’d rather just sign up privately and have a quick “no more emails please” button? That’s precisely where a reliable email forwarding service can save the day. It empowers you to create a special disguised email address and then use it when signing up with a new app, services, or website. You’ll still get any emails sent to the anonymous email address in your normal email inbox—but the service you sign up with won’t ever see your real address, and you can turn off the incoming emails whenever you like. Most such services require a payment, and they aren’t all trustworthy. But I’ve got a great exception to recommend. Unearth all sorts of fantastic tech treasures with my free Cool Tools newsletter from The Intelligence. A useful new discovery in your inbox every Wednesday! Protect your privacy with anonymous email addresses The best email-masking service for casual, everyday purposes is ​SimpleLogin​. It’s owned by Proton—a reputable company with a history of trust around the privacy-focused ProtonMail and ProtonVPN services. ➜ With a free SimpleLogin account, you can create up to 10 disguised email aliases for free. You can then use them wherever you want online to shield your real email address. ⌚ You can get started in about 30 seconds: Go to ​​the SimpleLogin website​​ and sign up for an account. Just provide your real email address (here, at least, lest you be unable to receive any of your fake-address forwarding messages)—then choose a password and click a link sent to your real email account to confirm. Click “Random Alias” on the SimpleLogin dashboard to create your first new random email alias. (There are other options, too—and a nice little tutorial.) Provide that email alias to any website while creating an account instead of your actual, real address. ~simplelogin.pngSimpleLogin makes it easy to create and copy privacy-minded masked addresses.~ That’s it! You can manage email addresses on the SimpleLogin site—for example, you can click a switch and stop receiving new emails sent to the alias. It’s very helpful for avoiding spam. SimpleLogin is available ​on the web​ as well as through ​an Android app​ and iPhone app​, if you’d rather. The service is free for up to 10 aliases. For ​$36 per year​, you can get unlimited aliases and more features, including the premium version of the Proton Pass password manager. SimpleLogin’s ​privacy policy​ looks great. The service says it never keeps your emails, and it does not log your IP address. Treat yourself to even more tech treasures with my free Cool Tools newsletter—one new off-the-beaten-path gem in your inbox every Wednesday and an instant introduction to an exceptional audio tool to start!",

        "description": "One week back, the European Commission shared its reservations about tech giants Google and Apple. Both companies were accused of violating the region’s DMA or Digital Markets Act. Therefore, a heavy punishment in the form of fines would ensue if the necessary changes were not made in due time. Now, it appears that the EC has taken a back seat on those claims, which could have included fining up to 10% of the company’s global revenue figures, which amounts to billions. Right now, the EU is showing flexibility, and it might be linked to the pressure of facing Donald Trump. The current US president’s administration warned against such actions, which could prove to be troublesome for companies working in the EU. Trump warned against extortion of US tech giants, which is why we might be seeing limited fines for Apple and Meta under the latest law. So while the fines would be minimal, they’ll still be implemented as the EU wants to save its face as per the new report. This is why the Cupertino firm would receive the fine, but at the same time be asked to make changes to the App Store. Meanwhile, Meta would be forced to pay a fine or consent to altering its business model. Meta’s Pay or Consent model has been under scrutiny for a while now, which the EU says is not fair. It doesn’t like the clause of paying a certain fee to avoid being tracked through ads, as that’s not something that should be done without consent. So the arrival of Trump has led to more rethinking amongst the EU think tank, and it includes the arrival of more modest fines than those seen before. The officials will surely be downplaying this decision, as caution is necessary, but experts know that the EU is under a lot of pressure from Washington. The comments from the Trump administration have been continuous and relentless. Many leading American tech executives also shared dissatisfaction with the EU regulation. In another analysis, it was discussed how the DMA is designed to target American tech titans. However, the EU says that’s not the case. It’s just trying hard to do its job and focus on matters such as being more compliant with tech giants than high fines that hit billions.

        "description": "Few apps are as inextricably linked to the iPhone as Apple’s Messages. Introduced with the original iPhone almost 18 years ago, the app (then called “Text”) has become the primary messenger for most iPhone users worldwide. It allows users to receive Apple’s proprietary iMessages, as well as RCS messages and old-school SMS messages. In recent years, Apple has introduced several new features to the Messages app and its iMessage protocol. Most recently, in iOS 18, the company allowed users to stylize text by bolding or underlining words, incorporated animated effects that make words shake or appear to explode, and enabled users to react to a message with any emoji. But while the above additions are nice, they’re mainly eye candy—and that only gets a messaging app so far. When it comes to being truly useful, Apple’s Messages still lacks some basic functionality—and reliability—other messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal have had for years. Apple is expected to preview the iPhone’s next operating system, iOS 19, at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9. Here’s hoping the company adds the following improvements currently sorrowfully lacking in Messages today. iMessage needs to work when traveling internationally Apple needs to address how its iMessages work when a user is traveling internationally and using a temporary travel SIM—as anyone who has tried to text a friend who is traveling overseas, or who has traveled internationally themselves, knows too well. If an iPhone user removes their domestic SIM card and replaces it with a temporary travel SIM, they often will not receive messages sent to the iMessage account associated with that phone number. Instead, the messages will, more often than not, simply disappear into the ether, never to be received again—even after the domestic SIM card is reinstalled. It may be natural to think that, of course, a person won’t receive a text if they don’t have the SIM card with the phone number the text was sent to installed in their phone. But that’s not how iMessages work. When you send an iMessage, you’re not actually texting the user’s phone number. Instead, you’re using their phone number as a routing identifier to deliver a message to the associated iMessage account. This is why your Mac and iPad can receive and send messages to and from your phone number-linked iMessage account. In other words, it shouldn’t matter that the user’s normal SIM card isn’t in their iPhone—they should still be able to receive the iMessages. This is how it works with competing apps like WhatsApp and Signal, which also use phone numbers as routing identifiers. Indeed, whenever a friend travels internationally, and I don’t get a response to an iMessage I’ve sent, I follow up via Signal or WhatsApp. They immediately receive those messages despite not having their domestic SIM card installed. I reached out to Apple about why iMessages don’t work in a similar matter, and the company told me that it was a security measure. Apple says that the measure triggers when an iPhone is without its domestic SIM cards for a few weeks, until which time users can still receive iMessages sent to their usual phone number. However, in my experience, this two-week timeframe is not accurate, and as soon as a domestic SIM card is removed from the phone, iMessages sent to the number will not go through. Apple also says that users can keep getting iMessages with a travel SIM if they have their friends send the iMessage to their email address instead of their phone number. But this relies on everyone texting you knowing that you are traveling internationally and without your domestic SIM card. While I understand the security reason behind this problem, it would be great if it were accurate that it only kicks in after two weeks. Even better: Apple should give users the option to disable this security measure for a period of time that the user can designate whenever they switch from their default SIM to a travel one. Archiving would help reduce clutter But reliability isn’t the only issue that Messages faces. For some reason, Apple still hasn’t added a feature that allows users to archive chat threads. Archiving helps declutter your messaging app by letting you move chats with people you no longer or rarely interact with—like the plumber who fixed your sink last month—to a separate folder. This frees up screen space and allows you to keep your most important and active chats front and center. Archiving is a great intermediary option between keeping a chat thread forever or deleting it entirely. It has been a standard feature in nearly every major messaging app for years. Why Apple’s Messages still doesn’t support such a basic feature in 2025 is beyond me. Bookmarking would offer quick access Speaking of basic features—Apple’s Messages lacks another one: the ability to bookmark individual messages. Other messaging apps, like WhatsApp, have allowed users to do this for a long time (WhatsApp calls this “starring” messages). Bookmarked messages are saved to a smart folder that the user can easily access inside the app in order to view their most important messages. This is a great way to quickly access an old message that you would otherwise have to scroll through lengthy threads to find again. There are many reasons to bookmark a message, ranging from the sentimental to the practical. An example of the latter might be when you want to quickly access important information someone had previously texted you—like the PIN code to a friend’s smart door lock so you can enter their house to feed the cats while they’re away. Labeling forwarded messages would eliminate confusion Even when iMessage does offer basic features that most other messaging apps offer, they are sometimes poorly implemented. The most glaring example of this is message forwarding, which allows you to easily forward a text one person sent you to another person. Other apps clearly indicate that a message is forwarded—often with an arrow or label in front of the forwarded message. But with Apple’s Messages, the forwarded message simply looks as though it was written by the person forwarding it. Case in point: The other day, I received a message from a friend that had a very uncharacteristic tone and subject matter. It confused me quite a bit. While I was reading it a second time, I received a follow-up message stating that the first one was from another individual, and my friend was simply forwarding it to me. Without that additional text message from my friend clarifying that the first message was forwarded, I wouldn’t have known, because Apple’s Messages doesn’t give any visual indication distinguishing a regular message from a forwarded one. Will Apple implement any of these changes in Messages in iOS 19? I hope so, but we’ll just have to wait to see. Apple is expected to preview iOS 19 at WWDC25 in June.",

        "description": "Gorilla Glass Ceramic will be appear on its first phone in the coming months. As a society, we have decided to carry expensive electronic devices that are made out of glass. It's a real problem, especially if you have butter fingers. Gorilla Glass maker Corning has announced a new material that might help save the day the next time you drop a phone. The company claims its latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic can withstand drops that would shatter lesser materials. As the name implies, Corning's new glass incorporates ceramic components to improve strength compared to other types of hardened glass. Corning has offered a bit of data to support this claim. In its lab tests (PDF), Gorilla Glass Ceramic withstood 10 drops from one meter onto surfaces that closely resemble asphalt. Why Corning does not use real asphalt for this test is unclear. Regardless, the company says an unspecified \"competitive\" type of aluminosilicate glass would typically fail on the first drop. Chemically strengthened glass has been a key component in the proliferation of smartphones across the world. Since the company provided the glass for that first iPhone back in 2007, it has made glass for more than 7 billion devices. That makes Corning the largest glass supplier in the mobile industry, but it does face increasing competition in the budget and midrange segments.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Ever since it became obvious that the iPhone was one of the most transformative consumer products in history, a question has been floating out there: Would its impact ever be matched by a device in an even newer category? And if something pulled it off, what would it be? After a decade and a half—so far—we aren’t any closer to getting answers. Yes, Apple has had its monster hits since then, especially the iPad, AirPods, and Apple Watch. But they haven’t been iPhone-size landmarks. Meta and others have poured billions into headsets and glasses with the explicit goal of replacing smartphones; still no iPhone. Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno—veterans of the iPhone—tried to leap to the next level with their startup Humane’s AI Pin, flopped, and recently off-loaded the remains to HP. I can’t help feeling, though, that the most promising territory for the next great device is right there in front of us. It’s our wrists, a location we’ve found handy for gadgets since the 19th century. Smartwatches demand no fundamental changes in human behavior to become part of our lives. By contrast, the AI Pin—which you wore affixed to clothing, with your palm serving as the screen for its laser-projected interface—was a failed bet on an altogether new experience. The fact that even the Apple Watch is merely an enormous success rather than an epoch-shifter doesn’t mean the opportunity to create a radically new smartwatch is lost. After all, Apple didn’t invent the smartphone. Contenders such as the BlackBerry and Palm Treo already existed. They were popular, even. It’s just that the iPhone sprinted right past them into a new era of computing. It even surpassed fantasies about what an Apple smartphone might be like. (In 2009, I wrote about what most pundits had been expecting: pretty much an iPod that could make phone calls.) So as much as I cherish my Apple Watch, I’d love to see a watch come along that makes it look like a BlackBerry. A few recent developments have had me thinking about that possibility—and, especially, the obstacles preventing it from happening. First, there’s the future of the Apple Watch itself. Last week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is investigating building cameras into its watches—not for snapshot-taking or FaceTime calls, but to enable the company’s “Visual Intelligence” AI. In theory, a camera-equipped Apple Watch could offer all sorts of new features based on it seeing the world around you, from better walking directions to nutritional information about food you’re about to eat. It might have a shot at fulfilling some of the AI Pin’s utterly unfulfilled ambitions to weave AI into everyday life. Given Apple’s unsteady footing in AI (as exemplified by its ongoing failure to ship the new and improved Siri it first demonstrated last June) it would be ridiculous to get giddy over the prospect of Visual Intelligence on the Apple Watch. To be even mildly intrigued, you need to buy into Apple getting a lot better at conducting ambitious AI in real time, and doing it on a device greatly constrained by computing power, connectivity, and battery life. Still, it seems likely that someone will build serious AI vision into a smartwatch. One no-brainer candidate: Google, whose Lens AR technology has been useful for years and could become part of a future Pixel Watch. That brings up a fundamental issue with smartwatches, at least for iPhone users, and anyone who covets their business. It’s that only Apple has a clear pathway to building an amazing new smartwatch that works with an iPhone. That is by design: The company provides itself with multiple custom affordances for integrating its phone and watch and is unwilling to share them with other manufacturers. For the decade-plus history of the Apple Watch, this fact has stunted the growth of the entire field. Back in 2012, before there was an Apple Watch, Eric Migicovsky’s Pebble helped create the smartwatch category. Migicovsky sold the company to Fitbit in 2016, ending its original run. Now he’s back with a company called Core Devices that, as he told my colleague Jared Newman in February, is building a very slightly modernized version of what Pebble once offered. It’s a sign of how slowly smartwatches have evolved that a minor upgrade to the 2016 Pebble actually sounds quite appealing. But in a blog post, Migicovsky wrote that the limitations Apple imposes on third-party smartwatches frustrate even Core Devices’ modest aspirations. His new smartwatch can’t handle notifications as adeptly as an Apple Watch, is shut off from supporting SMS and iMessage, lacks an easy way to integrate with third-party iPhone apps, and can’t access the internet if the Pebble app isn’t running on the iPhone. The title of Migicovsky’s post—“Apple restricts Pebble from being awesome with iPhones”—conveys his bottom line, which is that Google’s Android is a far friendlier platform than iOS for a company such as Core Devices. Migicovsky published his post on Monday of last week. Coincidentally, the European Commission dinged Apple the following day for the same kind of limitations that raised Migicovsky’s ire. However, the EC can do more than simply complain. In a ruling based on its Digital Markets Act, it has instructed Apple to make iOS work better with third-party smartwatches and other devices, providing a list of specific features (such as notifications) that the company needs to open up by the end of 2025. It also requires Apple to improve its communications with developers integrating products with its platform. As you’d imagine, Apple is not looking forward to adjusting its product strategy and technical road map based on a government edict. “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” the company grumbled in a statement. “It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.” Apple hasn’t yet explained its objections to the new EC ruling in detail. But it undoubtedly has several that go beyond its disinterest in helping other companies compete with the Apple Watch. For example, giving third parties more access to iMessage will introduce security issues that don’t exist with the current closed loop between the iPhone and Apple Watch. Widening the deep iOS access that the Apple Watch enjoys to support other devices could also lead to a less reliable experience. The most likely outcome may resemble Apple’s compliance with an earlier EC ruling that forced it to enable competitive app stores. In that instance, the company acted grudgingly, making changes only in the EU and without any effort to create a great experience for anyone involved. I do hope there’s at least a tiny chance that the EC’s ruling leads Apple to make government-mandated lemons into lemonade. It could surprise us all by supporting other manufacturers’ smartwatches wholeheartedly—not just where it’s a legal requirement, and not in such a cumbersome fashion as to discourage anyone from taking advantage of it. This much seems certain: If Apple doesn’t invent the next great wrist-worn gadget, somebody else will. It’s kind of fun to think about that somebody else creating something so compelling that Apple sees welcoming it onto the iPhone as being in its own self-interest—or at least a better option than giving iPhone fans any reason to even toy with the idea of switching allegiances.

        "description": "iPhone users can celebrate as they now have the option to switch to WhatsApp as their primary default messaging and calling platform, as reported by WBI. This means anyone trying to dial a phone number through the browser can now make the call through WhatsApp if they choose to allow so. The similar feature applies for sending out texts from any location, such as Maps, Contacts, and more. The iPhone maker says the feature is optional, so there’s no force. However, this has really opened up an array of options, so your phone setup is more customized to accommodate this service.Image: WBIIf you’d like to avail it, there are a few simple steps to follow to make the app a default option on iPhones. Firstly, make sure you are running iOS 18.2, and if not, update your app. After that, open up your Settings tab and then click on the Apps tab. Once that’s done, you go into the Default Apps, and that’s where you’ll see a host of compatible platforms. Simply choose WhatsApp on the Messaging and Calling menus. This is it! Next time you decide to shoot a text or make a call from a different component of your iPhone, it gets sent to your app’s setup.Remember, the feature is only listed for beta right now. This seems to be up for grabs on the new version of iOS, but it’s not as shared by the company. It’s a test flight beta for WhatsApp, but we do see it getting launched soon for all to use. If you’re keen on being some of the first to try it out, you can download and use it to trial the newest features before anyone else. However, this does mean that the company hasn’t sorted out the issues that come with bugs, so it’s really not for everyone out there.We can see this rollout being the beginning of a new change, and we can also hope to see more customization for apps owned by third parties after being added. Who knows, you might see an option to make Telegram soon, or heading to Maps after entering Google Maps. For that to work out, we’ll just need to wait and watch, so stay tuned.

        "description": "\"We didn't need BNPL for a burrito,\" a DoorDash executive said at Shoptalk, explaining that the platform's recent buy-now, pay-later deal with Klarna was intended for non-food, bigger ticket items like AirPods. Last week, DoorDash announced that it would partner with financial services firm Klarna to bring buy-now, pay-later capabilities to the delivery app. The news fueled heated commentary on social media and news outlets, wondering what it said about how debt-burdened Americans were that they would pay for a burrito in installments. But at Shoptalk, DoorDash’s vp of ads, Toby Espinosa, told Modern Retail that the partnership instead was designed less for food and more for the 25% of its customers —around 10 million of its 42 million monthly active users — who order from non-restaurant retailers. That could include deliveries of AirPods, flowers or other larger ticket items. And in fact, the financing offers — which allow customers to pay in four installments — are limited to products over $35. That share of non-food orderers has risen from 20% three to six months ago. Over the last few years, DoorDash has been partnering with more retailers to provide delivery services. DoorDash has 150,000 non-restaurant retailers on its platform, including grocery stores, convenience stores and pet stores. That number has doubled since 2022. Just last year, the platform added Camping World, The Vitamin Shop, Pet Supplies Plus, Sally Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, Lowe’s and DSW. As just one example of how much DoorDash increasingly relies on non-food deliveries, Espinosa said DoorDash delivered roughly 350,000 bouquets on Valentine’s Day.Continue reading this article on modernretail.co.

        "description": "Apple Watch sales are enduring a years-long backslide. While Apple first launched its watch in 2015, sales didn’t spike until the pandemic, when consumers were highly focused on their health. But competitors quickly caught up, with fitness-focused companies like Garmin integrating more smart technology. Meanwhile, Apple stumbled in adding compelling new features—getting into some legal spats along the way. For the past three years, Apple Watch sales have declined year-over-year, according to research firm IDC. In 2022, Apple sold 43 million units; by 2024, that number dropped to 34 million. The Apple Watch also lost market share, falling from 29.6% to 22.5%, while high-end competitor Garmin and budget alternatives like Huawei and Xiaomi gained ground. And although Apple doesn’t break out revenue by individual product, its “Wearables, Home and Accessories” segment was the only one to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. “Apple is in a weird spot,” says Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at IDC studying wearables. “They make great stuff but, at least on the watch side, things are a little bit iterative.” Where did the Apple Watch upgraders go? Apple Watch sales have fallen far from their 2022 peak. While some analysts remain optimistic—Ubrani expects Apple will regain modest growth in 2025—the numbers are still well below pandemic highs. Part of the drop, experts say, comes down to durability. “A lot of people bought a new smartwatch or replacement smartwatch during the pandemic,” says Ben Hatton, analyst of connected devices for CCS. “Those devices are yet to reach the point where they are beginning to be replaced. So there’s that longevity of device, especially for the top-end devices, that does hamper growth.” Unlike the iPhone, which users often upgrade for new features, the Apple Watch hasn’t changed dramatically in recent years. Ubrani notes that the device’s health and fitness sensors have remained largely consistent across generations. “You’re not getting a whole new experience, apart from maybe a shiny new case,” he says. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.) That could soon change. According to Bloomberg, Apple is currently testing watches with added cameras and Apple Intelligence. Ubrani says these updates could appeal to Apple loyalists—but they’re already standard features among competitors. “If we’re talking AI, I think Apple is behind, and visual intelligence would be a part of that,” he says. “In terms of adding cameras, they wouldn’t be the first one.” Who needs an Apple Watch these days? Apple isn’t the only company facing headwinds; the entire smartwatch industry has seen declining sales over the past three years, per IDC. But Apple’s competitors have weathered the downturn more gracefully. In 2023, when Apple Watch sales fell 15.8%, Google’s declined just 4.3%. And while both are expected to return to growth in 2025, Google’s projected 9.4% gain far outpaces Apple’s 4.9%. Even in a shrinking market, Garmin is gaining ground. Though its share remains modest at about 5%, the company sold nearly two million more watches in 2024 than the previous year. “You’ve got a group of consumers that are looking to buy the best, top of the range fitness trackers,” Hatton says. “They may have gone into them through the Apple Watch or the Samsung Watch, but increasingly, they’re realizing that what they want it for is the pure fitness element. Garmin is probably best positioned to serve that demand.” The wearables category has also diversified. Watches once dominated the space, but now consumers can choose from smart rings that track sleep, headbands that boost focus, and AI-powered sunglasses. While these devices are still niche, Hatton says their rapid growth poses a longer-term threat. Apple sold an estimated 40 million watches last year; by contrast, only about 2 million smart rings were sold across all providers. “If they continue to grow very quickly, then they may start to become a real challenger to watches,” he contends. And some consumers are simply over it. Maybe they grew tired of the endless notifications. Maybe they were shamed for wearing an Apple Watch at their wedding. Maybe they just missed the feel of a classic timepiece. “There’s been a resurgence of traditional watches,” Ubrani says. “People like the idea of having something that’s a little less mass produced, something that’s away from the mainstream.”",

        "description": "The EU has decided not to fine iPhone maker Apple after all for its choice of default web browser on iPhones and iPads. In 2024, the company was left with no choice but to comply with the Digital Markets Act by enabling the default web browser option from an entire list of choices for iPhones using iOS 18.2. In the past, they were allowed to use the default browser option of Safari only. Apple's initial compliance attempt faced backlash from browser companies, which accused it of deliberately delaying implementation. The delay hindered users from switching from Safari to alternatives like Chrome. Additionally, Safari remained the default browser for those who didn't manually select another option.The EU explained how the Safari browser still served as an unfair advantage. To improve this, Apple pushed new options on screens that show up at the start when using the iPhone. It could list Safari among different third-party options for browsers. The iPhone maker also enabled different browsers to use the web engines.The changes seem to be enough to make the EU happy, as per media outlet Reuters, as they’ve withdrawn all the fines and chosen to close the investigation. Many experts feel it might also have to do with the fact that the new Trump administration has rolled out threats for tariffs against the EU and will be forced to take stricter actions against different American organizations.If they did go ahead with the fine, it would be as high as 10% of the firm’s global revenue figures. Now Apple would certainly be happy with this news, but it’s not out of deep waters yet. It remains under investigation for more ongoing anti-steering cases. The Cupertino firm is accused of adding restrictions for developers to stop them from taking external payments across App Stores free of charge. So we still need to see how that unfolds with time. However, it can definitely breathe a sigh of relief as making the EU happy is not easy, and that’s why many tech giants, including Apple, face serious setbacks and legal challenges in this part of the world.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Instagram Addresses Concerns About Student Safety By Collaborating with Schools to Address Bullying and Harassment",

A new ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that Apple cannot participate in Google's upcoming antitrust hearing, which could leave a multibillion-dollar hole in Apple's balance sheet. The judges in the case say Apple simply waited too long to get involved. Just a few years ago, a high-stakes court case involving Apple and Google would have found the companies on opposing sides, but not today. Apple's and Google's interests are strongly aligned here, to the tune of $20 billion. Google forks over that cash every year, and it's happy to do so to secure placement as the default search provider in the Safari desktop and mobile browser. The antitrust penalties pending against Google would make that deal impermissible. Throughout the case, the government made the value of defaults clear—most people never change them. That effectively delivers Google a captive audience on Apple devices.Read full article Comments",

In the business realm, the word “startup” conjures up the garage as innovation lab, the bootstrapping and scrapping micro-firm that has the potential to disrupt an industry and grow into a behemoth. Apple comes to mind, and so does Microsoft. Social media platforms were once only a twinkle of a college student’s daydream mused upon in a dorm room. For middle-market companies and especially those with $100 million to $1 billion in sales — which means that they are already well-established — the smaller players in their respective industries, particularly within the services verticals, are gaining currency as formidable competitors. As detailed by PYMNTS Intelligence in the “Navigating Uncertainty: How Middle-Market Executives Adapt, Compete and Innovate,” 60 heads of product said that the development and tech-driven businesses they help steer are finding that the competitive landscape is shifting. Among middle-market firms, 42% consider innovation a primary or significant factor in their competitive strategy. But 13% of middle-market product leaders now see startups as their biggest competitive threat, a 2.6x increase from six months ago. Among the reasons that these smaller players are able to pose new challenges: They may be outstripped by their larger brethren in terms of sales, but they also have the key edge of being nimble, and quite often they harness artificial intelligence (AI) to improve their operations and to innovate in new ways. Large corporations remain the most frequently cited rivals for the middle-market companies, though the trend has been declining a bit, as the share of middle-market companies stating that these juggernauts are the biggest competitive threat has declined (in favor of smaller companies) from 33% to 27%. Rival middle-market businesses also saw a slight uptick in being named top competitors, rising from 12% to 15%. Private equity-backed competitors seen as a concern were lower among middle-market companies, inching lower from 10% to 6.7%. Drilling Down Into Service Industries The competitive shift is most keenly felt in service industries like real estate and finance. In those fields, 16% of leaders now view small businesses or startups as their main competitors, up from 11%. There’s awareness among all middle-market firms that innovating — in a bid to joust with the smaller challengers — has the beneficial effect of improving their own fortunes. The data shows that, in particular, heads of product prioritizing tech-driven strategies report 54% fewer instances of high uncertainty. Innovation leads to product differentiation and better perceptions of their brands in their respective marketplaces. In just the past half year, the share of middle-market firms citing technological advancements as a competitive challenge has risen fivefold. Innovation Is Key to Competitive Strategy We found that the firms that make innovation a primary or significant factor in their business development roadmaps are likelier to emphasize industry shifts (36%) and customer demand for more advanced solutions (24%), enabling them to pivot faster and reduce uncertainty. But the road to tech-driven innovations is no straight line. With technological advancements also emerging as a greater challenge — rising from 3.3% to 20% — middle-market firms must balance policy compliance with innovation to avoid falling behind in a complex business landscape.

At […] The post Apple CEO Tim Cook Calls DeepSeek’s AI Models ‘Excellent’ During China Visit appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told the official China News Service that DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) models are “excellent.” Cook said this on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing, a day before Apple is set to hold its developer conference in Shanghai, the South China Morning Post reported Monday (March 24). At the developer conference, Apple is expected to share details about Apple Intelligence with Chinese developers, according to the report. The company is waiting for final approval to add Apple Intelligence to iPhones in the country, the report said. When a new AI model from DeepSeek was launched in January, tech stocks plunged as the company claimed it achieved performance comparable to those of U.S. rivals while using substantially fewer Nvidia chips. During Apple’s Jan. 30 earnings call, Cook was asked about the rise of DeepSeek and said, “In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that’s what you see in that model.” In February, a top executive from China’s Alibaba said his company partnered with Apple to help bring AI-powered iPhones to China. “They want to use our AI to power their phones, so we’re very fortunate and extremely honored to be able to do business with a great company like Apple,” Joe Tsai, Alibaba’s chair, said at a conference in Dubai. It was reported in January that Apple’s iPhone sales dropped 5% late last year amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals and that much of the decline could be attributed to the lack of Apple’s AI features on phones sold in China. One roadblock was that Apple had not yet been able to add those features to iPhone 16s sold in China even as Chinese companies like Huawei added them. The company was trying to secure partnerships with Chinese companies to roll out its AI features. China requires generative AI operators to secure government permission before they can debut a product. “Apple’s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch,” Tarun Pathak, director at Counterpoint Research, said at the time.

        "description": "Let’s say you were spending tens of thousands of dollars to build yourself a fancy home theater. How would you go about actually watching movies in it? While you could always set up a Roku or Apple TV box to stream on, they’re not going to feel all that theatrical. Most streaming devices are too bogged down with banner ads and obnoxious upsells, and the streaming services themselves compromise on audiovisual quality for the sake of smoother streaming. Maybe what you actually need is a device that explicitly caters to videophiles with obsessively-manicured home theater setups. That’s what Kaleidescape has been trying to accomplish for the past two decades. This small company—with roughly 54 employees across its Mountain View headquarters and engineering offices in Waterloo—has made a name for itself among A/V diehards with its eye-poppingly expensive video players, which combine the convenience of digital delivery with Blu-ray quality. Just as notable, though, is its unfussy movie player software, which clears away all the cruft of modern streaming platforms to focus on the films themselves. “What we’re aiming at is trying to get you to an experience that is as close to the director’s intent as you possibly can get,” says Tayloe Stansbury, Kaleidescape’s CEO and chairman. Tayloe Stansbury [Photo: Kaleidescape] The cost of near-cinema quality doesn’t come cheap, at $4,000 for Kaleidescape’s entry-level Strato V Movie Player. But believe it or not, this is the start of Kaleidescape’s attempt to move down-market, having previously charged upwards of $10,000 for its hardware (plus the cost to purchase movies at about $20 apiece). Stansbury, a former Intuit CTO who took the helm at Kaleidescape after getting hooked on the system himself, says he’s on a mission to revitalize the company and reach new audiences after years of stagnant product development. But if that’s the goal, Kaleidescape may eventually need to reckon with the streaming business models it’s spent all these years rejecting. [Photo: Kaleidescape] Hi-fi movies Unlike most TV boxes you can buy today, Kaleidescape does not work with any streaming services or come with a free catalog of ad-supported content. After setting up the Strato V, you are presented with a sparse menu system for downloading movies—either for purchase or rental—and watching them. And “downloading” is the correct term, as Kaleidescape does not believe in the vagaries of streaming. Each film takes about 10 minutes to acquire over a gigabit wired ethernet connection—no Wi-Fi allowed—at which point it will play back even if the system’s offline. No other streaming platform supports that unless you’re on a mobile device. “When you play it, it’s perfect every single time,” Stansbury says. But the main differentiator is the quality of the content itself. While Kaleidescape gets the same source files from studios as every other digital movie store, it’s not in the business of seeing how much compression it can get away with. The company encodes video files at an average 65 Mbps, versus 12 Mbps to 30 Mbps for other services according to FlatpanelsHD, and it delivers lossless audio at 6 Mbps, matching or exceeding the quality of 4K Blu-ray discs with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Kaleidescape is also obsessive about finding issues in its video files through human review, and will either request updates from the studio or apply its own transcoding coding changes to address them. (Stansbury says the company’s record number of revisions for a single film is 92.) “It doesn’t matter if you’re on an inexpensive TV with no soundbar, or you’re in a million dollar theater, it will look and sound better when you feed it with high fidelity content,” he says. The result is sort of like listening to a CD instead of a lossy MP3 file: There are folks who will insist the difference is night and day, others who will never notice, and a third group that feels better on some gut level about having a pristine version either way. I probably fall into the third category. Kaleidescape loaned a Strato V to review for this story, and I made my eyes numb looking for barely-perceptible differences between Kaleidescape’s films and their 4K HDR streaming counterparts. On my Samsung QD-OLED TV, the colors in Mad Max: Fury Road seemed more natural than the on-demand version from Amazon, and maybe the audio was a little clearer, but was I just fooling myself? Hard to say. There was, however, one obvious improvement: Kaleidescape does a better job with subtitles. Its version of Parasite, for instance, used a much nicer font with no black background like Netflix’s version, and certain translated phrases made more sense (like “check WhatsApp” instead of “check the messenger”). Even more noticeable, at least to me as a longtime reviewer of streaming players, was the straightforward nature of Kaleidescape’s interface, which in a way it scratches the same simplistic itch as an iPod for music. There’s a row of recommended movie purchases at the top, a row of downloaded movies underneath, additional rows for movies-in-progress and favorites, and that’s it. The absence of distraction stands in sharp contrast to every modern streaming platform. Sometimes the sparseness can be vexing. There’s no voice search—at least not without dictating into Kaleidescape’s smartphone remote app—and the infrared remote requires line-of-sight to the box. But the system has some niceties as well, like the collection of popular scenes you can jump to in each film and the integration with Lutron, which allows for home automation in response to certain video queues, such as raising the lights when the credits start rolling. Those kinds of experiences have made Kaleidescape a favorite among A/V installers, says John Sciacca, who covered Kaleidescape extensively as a contributing editor for Sound & Vision and works as a partner at an installer in South Carolina. “Everybody wants it,” Sciacca says. “You might not want to pay for it, but you would love to own it. And there’s not too many things out there that deliver that kind of an experience.” Cheating death Kaleidescape didn’t start off in the movie download business. Its first product, which launched in 2003, was a $30,000 video server that made digital copies of users’ DVDs and played them all through single menu system. Bloggers mocked the concept. (“If that’s not worth selling a kidney, we don’t know what is,” Engadget‘s Paul Miller wrote in 2006.) But Kaleidescape won over home theater enthusiasts, who marveled at how it made sense of their DVD collections. It even skipped the FBI warnings and other annoyances that DVD viewers had to sit through. “The experience was just better,” says Josh Goldman, a longtime owner who runs the independent Kaleidescape Owners Forum. “You could instantly sort and find other movies you wanted. You could find related movies to the one you just liked. You couldn’t really do that with a rack of DVDs in their cases.” But there was a problem: The DVD Copy Control Association took issue with Kaleidescape’s digital copies, which had no way of ensuring that users still owned their original DVDs and weren’t sharing them. The group sued Kaleidescape in 2005 and eventually prevailed after seven years of court battles. A settlement in 2014 allowed existing customers to keep using their systems, but barred Kaleidescape from selling any new systems with DVD ripping capabilities. The lawsuit took its toll on Kaleidescape, which also ran into manufacturing problems developing a new Blu-ray-based product around the same time. In 2016, the company almost shut down, with then-CEO Cheena Srinivasan blaming the lawsuit for “millions of dollars in legal fees and years of lost focus” before it secured an equity funding round to stay alive. Sciacca says the company’s brush with death helped accelerate its pivot toward digital distribution, which had began several years earlier. With new funding and no more legal clouds, it was able to make more deals with movie studios. “Kaleidescape was founded on disc-based importing,” he says. “The lawsuit paved the way for Kaleidescape 2.0, but also kind of put an end to Kaleidescape 1.0.” [Photo: Kaleidescape] Making moves Stansbury wound up in control of Kaleidescape for somewhat selfish reasons. He acquired his first system in 2011, on the recommendation of an A/V dealer who was overhauling his home theater. Although he fell in love with the product, he wound up getting frustrated with some gaps in the movie catalog and had some ideas on how to revamp the product line. He reached out to Kaleidescape, offering to make introductions with his contacts in Hollywood, which led to him becoming an investor in the company before taking the helm outright in 2020. “I was annoyed with some decisions that were made about product roadmaps, and I called them up to grump about those,” he says. “And eventually that developed into meeting the chairman and being asked to take over leadership of the company.” Stansbury points to a few things Kaleidescape has done since then. Beyond shipping the Strato V, the company has released new server products with higher storage capacities, and it’s made a foray into B2B with a server product for movie theaters. The idea is that exhibitors can use Kaleidescape for quick, flexible access to back-catalog films at high quality instead of arranging for delivery from studios. “What we’ve done is cranked out a whole new bunch of products,” Stansbury says. “We’ve got a whole bunch of new products I won’t talk to you about that are in the pipeline for the future, and we’ve also been steadily growing revenue and improving the financial picture for the company as well.” Sciacca, who was close with former CEO Cheena Srinivasan, says that while Srinivasan was more engineer",

Apple has been sued for false advertising due to its delayed artificial intelligence (AI) rollout. As Axios reported, the proposed class action suit, filed last week in federal court, seeks unspecified damages for customers who purchased Apple products outfitted with the company’s AI capabilities, dubbed “Apple Intelligence.” “Apple’s advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release,” the suit says. “This drove unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple, as the company knew it would, and as part of Apple’s ongoing effort to convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price and to distinguish itself from competitors deemed to be winning the AI-arms race.” However, the suit adds, Apple’s products featured “a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence,” thus misleading consumers. The suit also says Apple advertised its products based on “overstated AI capabilities.” The lawsuit also notes that Apple has pulled a recent ad campaign touting AI capabilities of its Siri voice assistant from YouTube, but has otherwise “failed to retract all the similarly false representations in the market that began in the summer of 2024.” PYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. The suit comes at a time when — as noted here last week — Apple is struggling to catch up to competitors such as Amazon and Google as those companies roll out more advanced AI features. The company has said that improvements to Siri — originally planned to debut this year — had been pushed back until 2026. Amazon, meanwhile, recently announced Alexa+, an updated version of its home voice assistant that embeds generative and agentic AI. “It is a remarkable fall from grace for Siri that has culminated in a rare move by Apple: demoting the executive in charge,” PYMNTS wrote. The executive in question is John Giannandrea, ex-head of search and AI at Google, who had been overseeing Siri’s upgrades before. That job now goes to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Speaking with PYMNTS earlier this month, Siri co-designer Luc Julia said that an obsession with perfection is likely weighing down efforts to introduce an upgraded Siri. “They are falling behind because of this fear of not being perfect,” said Julia.

Apple is reportedly working on a new version of its Watch that includes a camera. As Bloomberg News reported Sunday (March 23), the camera would help the watch see the outside world and use artificial intelligence (AI) to provide relevant information. These watches are likely still generations away from hitting stores, writes Bloomberg’s Mark Gruman, but are on the company “roadmap,” with plans to add cameras to both the standard Series and Ultra Apple Watch models. But each watch would have a different camera set-up, the report added. In the Series watch model, the camera would be inside the display, as with the front-facing lens on an iPhone. With the Ultra version of the watch, the camera lens would sit at the side of the watch near the crown and button. This way, an Ultra user could point their wrist at something to scan an object, while Series wearers would have to flip over their wrists. Gruman added that it’s likely the watch cameras would not support FaceTime, as the screens are too small for adequate video-conferencing. Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about Apple’s struggles to catch up with its rivals on the AI front, with Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android devices, and Samsung’s Galaxy AI all ahead in integrating more advanced AI features. The company told Reuters recently that upgrades to its Siri AI assistant would be delayed until this year after promising those enhancements for 2025. Robby Walker, head of Siri at Apple, has said that delays and missteps by Siri were “ugly” especially after aggressively advertising its capabilities, according to a recent Bloomberg report. “It is a remarkable fall from grace for Siri that has culminated in a rare move by Apple: demoting the executive in charge,” PYMNTS wrote. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly removed AI head John Giannandrea, the former head of search and AI at Google, from running Siri operations, replacing him with Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. According to Siri co-designer Luc Julia, Apple’s obsession with perfection is likely hindering efforts to launch an improved version of Siri faster. “They are falling behind because of this fear of not being perfect,” Julia told PYMNTS in an interview this month. He noted that Siri was not created at Apple but rather by SRI International, directed by Julia. Apple later acquired Siri in 2010, and only after the intervention of one legendary executive. “Only one guy wanted it,” Luc recalled. “It was Steve Jobs.” ’ The post Apple’s Product Roadmap Reportedly Includes Camera-Equipped Watch appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Earlier this month, Apple officially announced that it would be postponing the launch of some planned Apple Intelligence features to a later, unspecified date in the future. These features mainly revolved around an AI-supercharged Siri. The news of the delay sent the tech press into a frenzy, with many writers criticizing the company for failing to deliver on its promises. Additionally, people speculated that the delay of these features could impact iPhone sales this year. While the criticism is justified, I think the prediction that the delay will impact iPhone sales places too much faith in the appeal of AI. Apple delays new Siri AI features As noted by 9to5Mac, the delayed features include Siri’s ability to understand queries based on personal context (“What time does dad’s train get in?”), consider what you are doing on your screen when you ask it to carry out a certain task (“Make a reservation at this restaurant”), and perform in-app actions (“Crop this photo using a square aspect ratio”). When the news officially dropped—Apple made the announcement in a statement to well-known tech blogger John Gruber—there was a big reaction from the tech media, including my colleague Harry McCracken, who wrote a smart response in his newsletter, Plugged In. Reporters and Apple fans alike weren’t merely disappointed that Apple delayed the features; they were upset that Apple purportedly showcased the features “working” last year—but in reality, that demonstration was nothing more than an animated mockup. “There’s a name for products like that: vaporware,” McCracken said. “The tech industry is rife with examples. Apple, in its modern history, has been atypically disciplined about avoiding them—which makes this incident only more striking.” When evaluating Apple’s actions from this perspective, I agree. You don’t expect a company of Apple’s caliber and market cap of over $3.2 trillion to show off what are essentially just concepts. Other companies, yes, but not Apple. What I don’t necessarily agree with is the belief by some Wall Street analysts that Apple’s delay of some of its AI features will negatively affect iPhone sales in the near term—or even into next year, when some of these features are now expected. That argument doesn’t make a lot of sense to me—for two big reasons. The average consumer doesn’t seem to care about AI smartphone features too much While I know that tech enthusiasts like me seem to care a lot about Apple’s AI offerings, I don’t believe that the same holds true for average consumers (e.g. those who don’t follow tech news or consider tech gadgets to be a very important aspect of their lives). Why do I think that “average” consumers care so little about Apple Intelligence? Because ever since Apple announced Apple Intelligence last June and rolled it out in October, I’ve never met a single person who said Apple’s new AI platform is why they are planning on buying a new iPhone. I’ve had people tell me they bought a new iPhone 16 Pro because of the camera upgrades or because they wanted a bigger screen or a faster device. But not once has anyone ever cited Apple Intelligence as the reason for their purchase. I’ve also had people tell me that they can’t wait to buy the iPhone 17 Air, rumored to be released this fall, but only because of its ultra-slim design, not because of Apple Intelligence. It’s not just my anecdotal observations that support my belief. As CNET reported in December 2024, a survey from trade journal SellCell found that 73% of iPhone owners and 87% of Samsung owners said that AI features “add little to no value” to their smartphone experiences. This was on top of an earlier CNET survey that found that among the 10 things that motivate consumers to upgrade their smartphone, “AI integrations” took 7th place, with only 18% of respondents saying it matters (beating out “phone color”). The most motivating factor spurring upgrades was “longer battery life” (61%), followed by “more storage” (46%), “camera features” (38%), “phone display/screen size” (32%), “keeping the ecosystem (i.e., iOS to iOS, Android to Android)” (24%), and “a new product release” (23%). Meanwhile, in January, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo—one of the most reputable and respected Apple analysts—published a blog post stating that there was no evidence that Apple Intelligence was actually driving hardware upgrade cycles. If Kuo, SellCell, CNET, and my observations are correct—and I think they are—then Apple’s delay of Apple Intelligence features won’t have much of an impact on iPhone sales in the near term. The iPhone is already one of the most versatile AI smartphones on the market But let’s say I’m wrong. Let’s say the average consumer really does care that their smartphone is packed with AI. I still don’t think Apple’s delay of some Apple Intelligence features matters that much—at least when it comes to the delay’s impact on iPhone sales. Why? Because the iPhone is already a powerful AI smartphone—and it has been for years. Not only are the majority of previously announced Apple Intelligence features already integrated into supported iPhones, but the App Store is filled with hundreds of AI apps, all of which allow you to expand the iPhone’s AI capabilities. These apps include chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, plus myriad AI image-generation apps, like DaVinci and WOMBO, and AI note-taking apps like Otter. Like other tech enthusiasts, I’m looking forward to the complete rollout of Apple Intelligence. But the iPhone doesn’t depend on it for its AI capabilities. The iPhone is already a platform on which hundreds of AI apps and services can run—and Apple’s delay in releasing its own AI offerings doesn’t change that.",

And no, she won't be responding to any of them.\"Up until now, I've been scared to 'like' it in case they might think that that's a confirmation that they're correct or something,\" Lachman told Business Insider.Keeping tight-lipped is tough work, especially when your character plays one of the most pivotal roles in Apple TV+'s hit workplace thriller. As Mark's (Adam Scott) wife Gemma, who is being held in captivity and experimented on at Lumon Industries, Lachman holds the key to the show's core mysteries.Season two, episode seven of \"Severance\" finally showed us what was happening to Gemma on Lumon's mysterious testing floor while her husband's innie was toiling away at his \"mysterious and important\" macrodata refinement work on the severed floor: Mark was refining 25 different severed consciousnesses for his wife. After he's done, there will be no need for her to exist anymore.The season two finale revolves around the rescue mission to free Gemma from Lumon, which seems successful in the end, with one major twist: After depositing Gemma outside Lumon's doors, Innie Mark opts to say inside with his love interest, Helly, rather than become his outie and join his wife.The ending was a surprise to Lachman, who said she didn't even know that Gemma would ultimately escape Lumon at the start of filming \"Severance\" season two.

Ditto what Emile the goat had to do with any of it.Honestly, we're just glad Emile is safe.Apple TV+She does, however, suggest that Gemma might not necessarily have been killed in a physical sense.\"In our show, death can mean different things.

Whether she's bluffing is unclear, but \"Severance\" creator Dan Erickson was just as tight-lipped about Cobel's interest in Mark and Gemma and whether their bond is potentially familial.\"All that I'll say is I think it's a big question throughout the series how earnest her affection is for Mark,\" Erickson told BI.\"I think that Cobel is somebody who's had to wear a lot of masks in her life and she has had to sort of spin a certain identity for herself given her place at Lumon,\" he said. \"And when we see her in season one as Mrs. Selvig, she is playing a role, but the question is always sort of which 'mask' is more real, which mask is more true to who she actually is? And Mrs. Selvig really cares for Mark and Ms. Cobel doesn't seem to.\"A third season of \"Severance\" is already confirmed to be in the works, and would likely reveal more about Cobel's true motivations.\"I think that who we care about in life is a big reflection on our identity and who we are,\" Erickson said. \"So this question of does she actually care for Mark on a personal level or is it a professional thing, pokes at the question of who she is deep, deep down inside.\"The \"Severance\" season two finale is now streaming on Apple TV+.Read the original article on Business Insider",

This week in artificial intelligence (AI) news saw Apple facing an AI reckoning, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said computing demand is set to jump 100-fold. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs looks ahead to a year of scaling AI; Hollywood’s upset at AI and IP issues; and Citi sees AI agent-to-agent payment systems coming. Apple Demotes Executive as Siri Lags in AI Upgrades Apple took the rare move of removing its top executive in charge of Siri upgrades as the AI assistant struggled to keep up with rivals like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android and Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Apple’s obsession with perfection, a top management that lacked vision and the missing brilliance of Steve Jobs have now come home to roost. Read more: Apple’s Siri: Once a Pioneer, Now an AI Laggard Nvidia CEO: AI Will Need 100-Fold More Computing Power Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the next stage of AI will “easily” need 100-fold more computing power. At its GTC developer conference, Huang said the shift to AI agents and reasoning models means the amount of computation necessary to train and do inference on those models “has grown tremendously.” He also predicted that in the future, working alongside the world’s one billion knowledge workers will be 10 billion AI agents.

Celebrities including Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Paul McCartney decried recommendations by OpenAI and Google to “remove all legal protections and existing guardrails” around the use of copyrighted content for AI training.

For actor Tramell Tillman, that means he's doing his job right.The Apple TV+ series became a critical sensation when it premiered in 2022, landing on many lists of the year's best TV and cultivating an extremely dedicated audience. Because \"Severance\" functions as both a brilliant send-up of corporate culture and a mystery box of unanswered questions, bizarre moments (those goats!), and cryptic dialogue, it's ideal fodder for fan theories. But like any good middle manager, Tillman is trying his best to stay professional and not engage with them.One of the biggest mysteries for fans is whether Milchick, the straight-laced, verbose Lumon Industries manager, is a good guy or a bad guy. Some are convinced that he's a loyal Lumon soldier, while others believe he's a double agent working against the company from the inside.As it turns out, Tillman doesn't know, either.\"This is a big exercise in faith and in trust,\"Tillman told Business Insider.\"I, like the fans, make guesses and theories. I'm usually wrong about them, so I always keep it to myself,\" Tillman continued. \"But I do not have the information.\"Is Milchick a friend or foe to MDR? Not even Tillman knows.Apple TV+In fact, Tillman says it's actually ideal not to have all the answers as an actor — that uncertainty helps him give a subtle, layered performance. \"The creative process is so tender and it can easily become a moment where you have too many cooks in the kitchen,\" he said.Despite rumblings of an \"endgame\" for how Mark's journey inside Lumon will ultimately conclude, the show is also malleable. Creator Dan Erickson, who also wrote the season two finale, has said that while the endgame for the show hasn't changed, the twists and turns along the way have taken shape as the show is actually shooting. Part of that is thanks to input from the actors.\"This experience, from season one to now, has always been this living, breathing, artistic exploration,\" Tillman said. \"There are always changes, there's always dialogue, and there's always collaboration.\"Mark S. faces off with Milchick on \"Severance.\"Apple TV+The \"Severance\" cast makes choices, including some that Erickson didn't map out himself, that are then picked up and overanalyzed by ever-vigilant viewers, who are constantly trying to solve the show's mysteries on places like Reddit.While Tillman appreciates the \"sheer brilliance\" of how attuned the fans are to the show's details, he says their attention can be a double-edged sword. In fact, Tillman said the creators tell the cast to be careful about what they're reading online, because a viewer making a connection that may or may not actually be there may influence their performance.\"A lot of the theories, and the ideas and the numbers and the connection to history and to Kier, some may just be a fluke,\" Tillman told BI. \"And I'll read it and I'm thinking, 'Wait, did they intend for that color to be used here, or did they intend that?' I was like, 'Wait, I played that scene all wrong. Wait a minute, let me go back.' And it's like, no.\"While Tillman typically avoids fan theories so they don't color his performance, he admits that being asked about them intensifies his curiosity to look them up. One especially weird theory he's seen is that there are actually several versions of Milchick running around the office and that they start off as goats. (He doesn't think that one's true, for what it's worth.)The unfalteringly loyal Milchick is placed on a performance improvement plan.Apple TV+Throughout \"Severance\" season two, Milchick is increasingly torn between being a loyal Lumon employee and his burgeoning apparent anger at the slights against him — the racist Kier paintings, getting a negative performance review, and his verbal sparring with Robot Kier in the finale.Tillman says he doesn't know if there's anything to the theories that Milchick is a secret double agent already working against Lumon from the inside, or whether Milchick is on a path that will ultimately lead him to turn against the company once and for all, but he enjoys playing into that duality as an actor.\"This is a man who is a keeper of secrets. And for me, if you keep a lot of secrets, there's a tendency to play your cards very close to the chest because either you don't want people to know that you have all the secrets or you don't want anyone to see your secrets,\" Tillman said. \"And he is, of course, a representation of this Lumon culture. And you notice that everyone in Lumon is pretty stoic. They're very inscrutable.

        "description": "Tech giant Apple has received orders from the EU to further open up the iPhone’s connectivity features so third-party devices like headphones and smartwatches can benefit. The goal is to enable them to tap into various iOS offerings by Apple and is in line with the region’s DMA. Basically, the EU wants to foster healthier competition among tech giants by creating a more leveled playing field among various social media apps, video-sharing apps, and search engines. The same goes for cloud systems, operating systems, and beyond. Apple designated several large firms as gatekeepers who continue to be scrutinized. That group entails Apple was complying with the DMA’s requirements for interoperability. Now this week, we saw more work done on that front including an investigation that spoke about what Apple needs to do to better comply with the Digital Market’s Act requirements.The EU shared how nine iOS offerings were predominately used for the likes of connected devices like TVs, smart devices, and headphones. So now, the regulators want Apple to say yes to device producers and app developers who wish to access their features that ming with such devices. This can include allowing quicker data transfers, displaying alerts on smartwatches, and simpler setup pairing for devices. Remember, all of the EU’s latest set of instructions arrive with deadlines. This iOS notification alert for smartwatches needs to be implemented by next year June. At the same time, instructions to design alternatives for AirDrop and AirPlay need to arrive by the end of next year.The EU says it wishes for Apple to have better transparency and effectiveness in this entire process that developers follow to attain interoperability through various devices. The EU wants the company to give developers the right documents on how to design alternatives for features like AirDrop and AirPlay. Furthermore, the Commission is asking Apple to produce a new channel whereby developers can roll out tech queries and feedback about the implementation of different features linked to hardware and software offerings through iOS. All new instructions are coming with deadlines for Apple. So as one can expect, the Cupertino firm is not happy with the news. They called the matter one which bounds the firm in red tape. This really slows them down restricts innovation for various users across the EU and forces them to give new features away. The goal is to level the playing field for all and ensure healthy competition where developers can similarly benefit. But Apple fails to see the light at the end of this tunnel. They called the decision a poor one that can negatively impact its products for EU users. However, it did hope to sit down with the EC and make them understand what reservations they have on this matter. Before this news, we saw Apple be fined for practices on the App Store. It was also forced to enable third-party app stores on different devices. Read next: OpenAI Unveils Three New Exciting Voice Models With Advanced Offerings",

When Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Siri, debuted in 2011, it was revolutionary for giving users the ability to “talk” to their smartphone. Siri’s capabilities were made possible by machine learning, which was state of the art at the time. Today, Siri lags behind competitors such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Gemini for Android devices, and Samsung’s Galaxy AI — all of which are ahead in incorporating more advanced AI features. Earlier this month, Apple told Reuters that improvements to Siri would be delayed until 2026. Previously, it had said Siri would see enhancements this year. Apple did not give a reason for the delay. The news comes as Amazon recently announced Alexa+, which embeds generative and agentic AI. Robby Walker, head of Siri at Apple, reportedly said that delays and missteps by Siri were “ugly” especially after heavy marketing on its capabilities, according to a Friday Bloomberg report. It is a remarkable fall from grace for Siri that has culminated in a rare move by Apple: demoting the executive in charge. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly removed AI head John Giannandrea, the former head of search and AI at Google, from overseeing Siri, according to Bloomberg. Instead, Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell will take over upgrading Siri. Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea will still oversee other AI efforts at Apple. The change was made following Apple’s secretive Top 100 meeting that gathers its most important executives to an off-site location to chart Apple’s course — an event Apple co-founder Steve Jobs himself created. Bloomberg said the top topic at the meeting was Apple’s AI efforts. Read more: Report: Apple Makes Leadership Changes to Speed Development of AI-Powered Siri Perfection and Corporate Myopia According to Siri co-designer Luc Julia, an obsession with perfection is likely hampering efforts to roll out an upgraded Siri faster. “They are falling behind because of this fear of not being perfect,” said Julia, in a previous interview with PYMNTS earlier this month. Julia said Siri was not actually created by Apple. Rather, nonprofit research and development group SRI International, directed by Julia, developed it. SRI was spun off as a separate company in 2007; Apple acquired Siri in April 2010 and integrated it into the iPhone 4S in 2011. At the time, Apple executives didn’t see the opportunity Siri presented. Apple wouldn’t have acquired Siri’s technology if it weren’t for Jobs, who insisted on it, according to Julia, who later joined Apple as a director. “Only one guy wanted it,” Luc recalled. “It was Steve Jobs.” Julia sees the same cautiousness now among Apple’s top management about revamping Siri. “It’s the same story we are talking about today, which is, don’t go too fast. We’ll see if we want to do it.” Since Jobs’ passing in 2011, new ideas at Apple have been few, and they were hit or miss. The most innovative thing Apple has done since then is the Apple Vision Pro, its augment reality headset, Julia said. The rest of the company is “basically running on what exists.” See also: Siri’s Original Co-Designer Says Apple’s ‘Fear of Not Being Perfect’ Hampers Siri Revamp ‘We Saw Apple Without Steve Jobs’ In 2013, Oracle Chairman and then-CEO Larry Ellison was asked by CBS how he thought Apple would fare without Jobs. “We conducted the experiment. It’s been done. We saw Apple with Steve Jobs,” said Ellison, drawing his finger up to mimic rising fortunes, “we saw Apple without Steve Jobs,” bringing his finger down to show declining sales. Ellison was referring to the time when Apple’s board fired Jobs in 1985 after he lost a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley. Apple’s business began to fail. In 1997, Jobs returned as CEO. Jobs would go on to launch the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, dominating the music, smartphone and tablet industries. “He’s irreplaceable,” Ellison said. “They will not be nearly so successful because he’s gone.” The post Apple’s Siri: Once a Pioneer, Now an AI Laggard appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Apple TV+ has about 45 million subscribers but is losing more than $1 billion a year, The Information reported Thursday (March 20), citing […] The post Report: Executives Scrutinize Apple TV+ Costs Amid $1 Billion Annual Losses appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple executives are reportedly taking a closer look at the costs of the company’s streaming service, Apple TV+, because it is the only part of Apple’s services business that is not profitable. Apple TV+ has about 45 million subscribers but is losing more than $1 billion a year, The Information reported Thursday (March 20), citing unnamed sources. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Losses are not unusual in the early years of a streaming business, and Apple’s business plan for Apple TV+ foresaw losses of $15 billion to $20 billion in its first decade, according to the report. However, amid executives’ scrutiny of spending, Apple trimmed about $500 million last year from the $5 billion annual Apple TV+ had for content, per the report. Apple’s services sector is a major growth driver. This business — which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals — achieved record revenue and a 14% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, PYMNTS reported Jan. 30. The company reported at the time that it had over 1 billion subscriptions, including direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud and subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store. The services business has seen nearly $100 billion in revenue in the past year, with paid subscriptions growing at a double-digit pace and customer engagement with service offerings increasing. In February, Apple made the Apple TV app available on Android, allowing users of Android mobile devices to download the app to subscribe to Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass, the home of Major League Soccer. “Following its launch on November 1, 2019, Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service in its debut,” the company said at the time in a press release. The company’s February announcement about this change marked the first time the Apple TV+ app was made available for Android devices, though it already worked on Roku devices, game consoles and most other smart TVs, in addition to Apple’s own devices.

        "description": "Apple is looking to right the ship after a major Siri delay. Apple was slower than most Big Tech firms to jump on the generative AI hype train, but it finally got there with the release of Apple Intelligence. The first components of Apple's AI rolled out last year, but it's going to take a bit longer for one of the most hotly anticipated features. After announcing that the improved Siri was delayed until 2026, Apple has reportedly begun an uncharacteristic reorganization of its executive ranks. The new report from Bloomberg claims that Apple hopes to get its AI-backed Siri efforts back on track after months of delays. The updated assistant is supposed to leverage on-device data to improve personal context to make interactions more natural and work across apps. CEO Tim Cook has apparently become dissatisfied with John Giannandrea, the company's AI head. Apple leadership discussed the lagging Siri AI features at length during a recent summit, and the result is that Giannandrea will no longer be overseeing Siri development. In the coming days, Apple is expected to tell employees that Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell will be stepping in to take over development of the next-gen Siri. This will remove Apple's troubled virtual assistant completely from Giannandrea's oversight, leaving him to work on AI research and testing initiatives. Apple's Vision Products Group, which is responsible for developing the company's VR headsets, will be managed by Rockwell deputy Paul Meade going forward.Read full article Comments",

Apple TV+ is nearly six years old, and reportedly losing $1 billion a year.Apple can afford those losses. But it's still unclear why Apple would want to fund a money-losing, niche streamer.\"Severance\" is the thing Apple always wanted but never had until this year: An HBO-style show that critics and chattering classes adore — and that regular people actually watch — streaming on its Apple TV+ service. The season finale debuts Thursday night.That's the good news for Apple. The less-good news: Apple has been working on Apple TV+ for six years. And it's still unclear why, exactly, Apple has spent many billions on it.That's the takeaway from The Information's new report on Apple's high-profile, very expensive service.

But Netflix now makes lots of money, and Wall Street has forced the big media companies that own other streamers to turn those operations profitable, or at least close to it.But the issue isn't that Apple, which made close to $100 billion in profit last year, can't afford to fund Apple TV+ losses. It's that Apple still seems unclear about why Apple TV+ exists.Ma says Apple executives have thrown out different ideas that all seem like a stretch — like that people who already own iPhones will be more inclined to keep them if they also watch Apple TV+, or that people who watch Apple TV+ on non-Apple devices might be inclined to buy one if they watch Apple TV+.\"However, the company didn't have internal data on whether that strategy ultimately led to higher device sales, according to multiple people who worked for Apple TV,\" Ma reports. Apple hasn't responded to my request for comment.And, of course, there's the idea that Apple TV+ is just one of the services Apple uses to boost revenue when its core iPhone sales are slowing or actually declining.

Apple TV+ is nearly six years old, and reportedly losing $1 billion a year.Apple can afford those losses. But it's still unclear why Apple would want to fund a money-losing, niche streamer.\"Severance\" is the thing Apple always wanted but never had until this year: An HBO-style show that critics and chattering classes adore — and that regular people actually watch — streaming on its Apple TV+ service. The season finale debuts Thursday night.That's the good news for Apple. The less-good news: Apple has been working on Apple TV+ for six years.

Apple has reportedly made some leadership changes to speed up its development of artificial intelligence (AI) products. The company has put Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell in charge of its virtual assistant, Siri, and removed Siri from the oversight of AI head John Giannadrea, Bloomberg reported Thursday (March 20), citing unnamed sources. Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, according to the report. He will leave the Vision Products Group (VPG) and be succeeded there by Paul Meade, who has run hardware engineering for the Vision Pro. The moves have not yet been announced, but the news will be shared with Apple employees this week, per the report. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The leadership changes follow an annual offsite meeting of Apple’s senior leaders, the “Top 100,” at which the company’s AI efforts were a key topic of discussion, according to the report. The company’s AI system, Apple Intelligence, is considered a flop and efforts to add new features to Siri have been repeatedly delayed, the report said. Rockwell has a demonstrated ability to ship new products and, with the Vision Pro, became one of the few Apple leaders over the last decade to take a major hardware device from conception to market, per the report. Apple must move faster on AI improvements to Siri because consumers are starting to notice that the company’s AI is lagging behind competitors in the market, such as ChatGPT, the new Alexa, Google Gemini and others, Luc Julia, a co-designer of the original Siri and now chief scientific officer at French automaker Renault, told PYMNTS in an interview posted March 7. “People are realizing more and more that they are not at the front end of the technology,” Julia said. It was reported in February that Apple was dealing with tech issues that could delay its long-awaited Siri update. The company first introduced plans for a new, AI-powered version of the voice assistant at its developers conference last year, and went as far as to advertise some of its features, but was still scrambling to finish the software. At the developers conference in June, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the suite of AI features included in Apple Intelligence was set to “introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation.” The post Report: Apple Makes Leadership Changes to Speed Development of AI-Powered Siri appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "iPhone maker Apple has been facing a serious amount of scrutiny in the past by Brazil for disabling app sideloading. At the start of this month, a leading Brazilian judge gave the Cupertino firm just a three-month deadline to enable iOS sideloading for users in the country. Despite that call, we’re seeing things change drastically after another court ruling. This includes not forcing Apple to implement the necessary changes for now. The news was shared with the local media outlet Estadio yesterday who confirmed the ruling done by the Federal Civil Court judge found in Brazil. They ruled out the iPhone maker could carry on distributing these apps exclusively via the App Store without enabling developers to select other apps. This is what sideloading is all about.Last year, the Brazilian antitrust regulator dubbed Cade shared how Apple needs to enable the distribution of various apps located outside the Brazilian App Store. Therefore, the company would get just 20 days to comply with the call. On that note, the iPhone maker didn’t waste much time and appealed against the decision. This went in the company’s favor as another judge ruled that this measure wasn’t necessary at all nor was it urgent. Therefore, Apple was given more time to discuss this particular case. A hearing with Apple was carried out in the public and various organizations such as Epic Games were included. This led the court to rule against Apple and provide them with just 90 days to enable sideloading. It felt this was necessary as the limitations put forward by the organization might jeopardize the arrival of new competition in this segment. The court went on to claim how Apple rolled out similar types of changes across the EU without any kind of major impact or damage to the business. During that time, a spokesperson for Apple mentioned how this decision would impact privacy as well as security negatively of all iPhone users. So as you can see, the appeal clearly had a very positive outcome for the tech giant as the Brazilian court also felt how Apple was getting punished in a manner where it appeared as if it was convicted. This is although the case isn’t closed just yet.Now we cannot assume that Apple had come out on top. However, we can admit that this provides the company with a lot more time to prepare for what the next court has to bring forward. One name that will not be too happy with this news is definitely Epic Games. They shared just recently how it would be rolling out Fortnite for all Brazilian Apple users in July. We must remember that the regulator in Brazil could still appeal such a decision of the court. Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Who Does Israeli Spyware Maker Paragon Cater To?

        "description": "The European Commission has decided to slap Google and Apple with antitrust charges. The news comes despite American President Trump vowing to block the EU for overseas extortion of American tech giants. The EC which is deemed the executive body for the EU mentioned how Google’s parent firm Alphabet breached the DMA which is a landmark law designed to tackle serious competition problems present inside Search and Google Play.The latest bloc targeted Google Search for giving preference to its own services over other archrivals in the industry. This phenomenon known as self-preferencing is usually not allowed under the Digital Markets Act.The European Union also shared how Google Play stops app developers from freely driving consumers to different alternatives. In reply to the actions carried out by the EU, Google shared how such actions were harming both its business and clients. The company provided examples of changes that it made to search results so it could comply with the DMA.This means allowing traffic to divert towards other intermediate platforms which it claims gave rise to higher costs for clients. The findings of the commission are making the company make more changes to display certain kinds of Search results, Google confirmed. This means it might be more difficult for people to nail the right search and reduce traffic diverted to different businesses in the EU. Google disagrees with the accusations.Meanwhile, the EC is also sharing with the world how Apple needs to make similar changes to better comply with the Digital Markets Act. Through such interoperability obligations through EU competition rules, it hopes Apple can level the competition playing field.This includes giving other platforms the chance to communicate with one another more simply. So users can port data from one place to the next without facing Apple’s restrictions. For the iPhone maker, it means giving third parties the chance to create more innovative goods and services on the tech giant’s gatekeeper apps.In reply to the measures taken by the EU, Apple shared how the decision puts red tape on the organization and slows down its ability to provide innovation to various users inside the EU. This also means Apple might be giving away new features without any additional cost to firms that do not play by any similar kinds of rules.The EU hopes to work closely with tech giants and establish a positive and healthy competition landscape as shared in the latest press statement with media outlet CNBC. Now what is interesting is how Donald Trump has threatened to slam the EU with a new tariff which it feels is necessary. According to the Trump administration, excessive regulation of American tech giants is unfair and unacceptable.This is why they threatened to impose new taxes on Europe to prevent overseas extortion of big tech firms through means like digital services taxes, policies, and serious measures. In reply to that, the EU threatened to make use of anti-coercion instruments that enable such practices to arise.

        "description": "Following continuous trade tensions between the European Union and the United States, the European Commission moved forward with the enforcement of its digital antitrust rules on Alphabet’s Google and Apple. On Wednesday, the commission said in a press release that Alphabet treats its own services, such as shopping, hotel booking, transport, or financial or sports results, more favorably than other results offered by third parties, and that Alphabet displays its own services at the top of Google Search results with enhanced “visual formats and filtering mechanisms.” The commission noted that it informed Alphabet that its app marketplace, Google Play, does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), as app developers are prevented from steering consumers to other channels that may have better offers. Alphabet now has the opportunity to review the documents in the commission investigation file and respond. If the commission upholds its preliminary assessment, it would then issue a noncompliance decision. “We will keep engaging with the Commission and comply with its rules,” Google said in a blog post. “But today’s findings now increase the risk of an even worse experience for Europeans. The DMA is designed to regulate large platforms like Google, Apple, and Meta, and boost competition, but in reality, it is having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers.” In another press release, the commission specified the measures that Apple has to take to comply with certain aspects of its interoperability obligation. According to the commission, “interoperability enables a deeper and more seamless integration of third-party products with Apple’s ecosystem” and is the key to “opening up new possibilities for third parties to develop innovative products and services on Apple’s gatekeeper platforms.” The commission then outlined its recommendations for Apple to enhance the interoperability of its iOS devices with competitors’ products, such as headphones, smartwatches, and virtual reality headsets, in order to comply with the DMA. These included requiring Apple to improve the compatibility of third-party smartwatches and headphones with iPhone and iPad operating systems and simplifying the pairing process for users. “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” the company said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal. The decisions on Apple and Google are just the latest of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and EU. On March 13, President Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European alcoholic beverages in response to the EU’s 50% tariff it imposed on American-made spirits. The EU’s move came in retaliation to Trump’s 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel, which took effect on March 12.",

Even if you don't know its roots as an outgrowth of a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project, Plex is not your typical \"streaming\" service, given how most people use it. So as Plex announces its first price increase to its Plex Pass subscription in more than 10 years, it has its work cut out explaining why, what's included, and what is changing. Starting April 29, the cost of a Plex Pass rises from $5 to $7 monthly, from $40 to $70 annually, and a lifetime pass now costs $250, previously $120. In a blog post, Plex cites rising costs and its commitment to an independent service that supports \"personal media.\" \"We are all in on the continued success of Plex Pass and personal media,\" the post states. \"This price increase will ensure that we can keep investing dedicated resources in developing new features, while supporting and growing your favorites.\" The post cites a roadmap that contains an integration with Common Sense Media, a new \"bespoke server management app\" for managing server users, and \"an open and documented API for server integrations,\" including custom metadata agents.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Since the term “design thinking” took off in 2000, the once boutique industry of design became a household term. Spurred on by the stratospheric growth of Apple after the iPhone launch in 2007, businesses invested untold sums purchasing design companies and building design proficiency in-house. The cherry on top arrived when McKinsey published a report in 2018 cementing the value of design in leading businesses cross-sector. And then? For the last several years, the design industry has quietly lost some of its luster. We’ve published multiple stories examining how the world of business broke up with design, while a generation of design leadership has grappled with the effects. Truth be told, the reality is more complex. Design is still vastly more present within companies than it was decades ago, but it’s certainly been deprioritized during a business cycle that’s championing technology and marketing. Things look so bad because, for a moment, they looked so good. At Chicago’s The Future Of… conference in early March, dozens of design leaders—chief design officers, VPs, and other high ranking designers at companies including P&G, 3M, Ford, J.M. Smucker, Verizon, Duracell, Whirlpool, and GE Healthcare—gathered to respond to the provocation: “Is Design Dead?” My favorite moment was when design teams from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo formed an impromptu circle mere feet from a careful assortment of each company’s products on ice. Consultant John Gleason—who organized the conference alongside David Butler (Coca-Cola’s first VP of design) and industry vet Fred Richards—kicked things off by sharing some disquieting data. In analyzing hundreds for Fortune 500 companies, he found that 39% had cut the top one to two levels of their design organization, downgrading the level or title of heads of design. Nine percent had eliminated half of their design team in the last year. And in 84% of all cases, design reported not to the CEO, but to a specific function (like marketing) or functional executive. And in 74% of those cases? The head of design was not even reporting to the head of their functional unit. [Photo: Andrew Boynton] I was invited as the only journalist to attend the conference, to both share my perspective on stage and listen in to private, frank debates about the state of design and its future. Given the sensitivity of corporate perspectives being shared, I agreed to Chatham House Rule reporting. In other words, I could publish themes and even quote what was said, but for the protection of everyone, nothing will be attributed to anyone. [Photo: Andrew Boynton] Here were my 10 takeaways from two days of talks, though I would offer a significant caveat: Most designers in attendance worked for CPG companies, meaning this information is heavily biased toward that industry, versus what we might hear from technology, UX, product, interior design, etc. For the tl;dr version, let me say: Design is a practice as old as humankind. It can never and never will die. But for the industry to re-achieve its peak relevance, the practice needs to evolve, think bigger, and maybe go get that MBA already. 1. Yes, design is hurting at a lot of companies Companies have slashed back and demoted their design practices. With definite exceptions in the room, the general consensus was that designers were struggling to be relevant, and even have jobs, at their companies. “It’s a shitshow out there,” one person put it, bluntly, while another offered that “design is not healthy.” 2. Designers blew their big moment Out of 2010, the investment big in design teams promised true business innovation. When one panelist challenged the room to cite a major breakthrough design generated in this era, they were met with crickets. “We were sexy,” one person put it, but the farther you ride, the farther you fall.” The solution to earning back credibility in the meantime is that designers need to “do less with less,” another suggested, taking a more “surgical approach” to projects that could meet needs in the business. 3. We’re in a down cycle One of the most commonly recurring themes from the panels were about cycles of investment. That for whatever reason, we’re in a down cycle of design. I agree with this argument, and presented a take of my own: We are in a technological cycle and a marketing cycle. Gen AI drove the need for immediate investment in core technological capabilities. Mature social media (TikTok in particular) rewarded rich investment in data driven marketing campaigns. And in the meantime, design was deprioritized as a less essential job during years of cost cutting layoffs. However, designers will ultimately be the ones that turn AI into functional products, and there are only so many marketing collabs Gen Z will buy before they, too, prioritize more meaningful consumption, and sustainability (hopefully) becomes a global priority again. But for now, companies are abandoning climate pledges to build AI data centers. 4. Designers sell their practice without solidifying their value One theme I noticed was that designers in the room that still boasted rich investment from their companies proselytized the quantifiable impact of their work—often that they saved their company money, or measurably added brand equity—whereas most admitted that designers were poor at articulating the ROI of their own practice. But you know who is great at talking ROI? CMOs. “Marketing leaders can outline their strategy. Design leaders can’t,” someone said. “No wonder design has trouble competing with marketing on solutions.” These days, many design teams are answering to a CMO, which is a failure of designers’ self-marketing inside the company. As one design leader pointed out, they see three paths forward: One, marketing takes over design. Two, marketing and design share responsibilities. Or the third, where marketing reports to design. To most designers, the third option is the most ideal—but it also might be the most sustainable for business. Design as a broad practice can contain marketing, while marketing does not naturally contain the umbrella of design. 5. Designers have failed to speak the language of business Why don’t designers keep the ear of the C-suite? “Enough designers don’t speak the language of business,” one person put it, flatly. And over two days, several people pointed out that designers simply do not know the proper lingo to be taken seriously inside companies. Designers tend to be spreadsheet adverse as they hang their hats on liberal arts. Especially at large organizations, most business units will be run by MBAs and traditional, business-minded people. This mismatch creates friction to sway a CEO, sure, but the issue compounds as designers really need buy-in from cross functional teams to make things happen. “Our gift is synthesis, which is why we need to bring in our own data,” said one leader. “I spend all my time building relationships [across the company] to get to that data.” 6. Design thinking has undercut the value of design Over two days of talks, I witnessed all variety of reaction to the term “design thinking.” But especially with the fall of Ideo—the mecca of design thinking—it’s clear that the term has often become shorthand for, what an IDEO partner once framed to me as enabling a “theater of innovation.” It’s a methodology to problem solving akin to the scientific method, and it’s every bit as intelligent as the person wielding it. Yet the design industry has spent two decades rallying behind the term, leveraging it to get buy-in from companies that used it to teach everyone “how to think like a designer.” But “Design thinking is not design, and there’s a huge disservice done when educating business on how to run a design thinking session,” said one panelist. Namely, it cheapens the practice of design, commoditizing a craft to something you learn over a box lunch. “If the height of the [design] curve was the Ideo shopping cart video, we may be in the pit of despair right now,” joked another. Not everyone at a company is a designer. Just like they aren’t all an accountant. Or an IT specialist. 7. Maybe design needs a new name There is no vagary what someone means when they tell you they are an “architect.” But what does a “designer” conjure? A million possible things. “The term ‘design’ is a problem,” says one expert, noting that we’ve tried being more specific with “CX” and “UX” but each permutation comes with its own costs. “The term ‘interior design’ is more limiting than effective,” they posit. The terms seem either too big, or too small, for designers to fit any definitional impact. 8. Design’s lack of diversity limits its reach We’ve reported on the lack of diversity within design for the last decade and, over that time, the numbers haven’t measurably improved. Noting the majority of whiteness in the room, one designer said, “We design for people who don’t look like most designers.” I’ll admit some disappointment by how shocked some in the room were at this statement. (Should we really be surprised to contemplate that design is too white in 2025?) But that doesn’t make it any less true. With the current administration’s attacks on DEI, diversifying design is only a greater uphill battle. However, design representation isn’t just a path toward equality; it’s a path toward understanding the needs and desires of more customers. 9. Corporate reorgs kill design strategy Whether it’s a new CEO or a completely new org chart, the increased instability of business drives an instability of the design practice. “I’ve had seven reorgs in four years,” one designer lamented—who was not the only one to share such a sentiment during the week. But why is this bad for design? As many echoed through the conference, designers think well in the medium- to",

        "description": "The iOS 18 came with a unique spin-off of Apple’s password management tool stored in settings. This new standalone platform dubbed passwords was the iPhone maker’s first chance to make credential management so much more useful for so many users. It’s now been shared that a serious HTTP bug left plenty of them vulnerable to phishing attacks for about three months from the release of iOS 18 until we saw a patch arrive for iOS 18.2. The news comes to us thanks to security experts at Mysk who first highlighted this flaw after findings from Apple’s App Privacy Report showed some alarming statistics. It ended up contacting up to 130 different web pages over the insecure HTTP traffic. This prompted the duo to carry out more investigations. That is when it was shared how the app was getting account logos and icons over the HTTP but also defaulting to opening up new reset pages for passwords through the unencrypted protocol. This leaves the user so much more vulnerable and the attacker gets exclusive access that might intercept the HTTP request and redirect people to other phishing pages. Many were so surprised that the tech giant did not enforce this HTTPS by default for such sensitive platforms. Furthermore, Apple needs to provide options for those who are privacy-conscious so that they can disable downloading icons as a whole.Many modern websites enable unencrypted HTTP connections but then redirect those to HTTPS via the 301 redirect. It’s imperative to mention that while this app before the iOS 18.2 launch would make requests over HTTP, it would end up getting redirected towards the safer HTTPS variant. The issue arises when attackers are linked to similar networks like users and they intercept the actual HTTP request before redirecting them. That is where manipulation of traffic takes place in different ways. From there onwards, it might manipulate traffic uniquely. As shown by Mysk’s demo, this entails modifying requests for redirects to phishing sites which are similar to Microsoft’s live.com. This is where the attacker can get credentials easily from victims and launch various kinds of other attacks. We saw this get patched in December 2024 silently but the fact that Apple is disclosing it now is major news. The Passwords apps use HTTPS now by default for various connections so you need to ensure you are running nearly 18.2 on different devices. Now we won’t be too surprised if the facts continue to travel below the radar.

Apple is expanding Tap to Pay on iPhone to nine new countries in Europe. The contactless payment method is now available in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland, the tech giant said Tuesday (March 18). “With Tap to Pay on iPhone, merchants can accept contactless payments through a supporting iOS app on an iPhone Xs or later running the latest iOS version,” Apple said in a news release. “At checkout, the merchant will simply prompt the customer to hold their contactless credit or debit card, iPhone or Apple Watch, or other digital wallets near the merchant’s iPhone, and the payment will be securely completed using NFC technology. No additional hardware is needed, so merchants can accept payments from wherever they do business.” According to the release, the solution is available on a range of different payment platforms throughout Europe, including Adyen, myPOS, Revolut, Viva, Stripe, SumUp, Worldline, Nexi and PlanetPay. Tap to Pay on iPhone works with contactless credit and debit cards from American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa. The announcement comes weeks after Visa revealed that Tap to Phone adoption has surged by 200% year over year around the world. In the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, rates have jumped to a combined 234% growth rate. “Tap to Phone is a tech equalizer for businesses. Walk into some of the world’s largest retailers or go to your local farmer’s market and they’re using this same technology to accept payments right on their phone,” Mark Nelsen, global head of Consumer Products at Visa, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster in an interview in connection with the announcement. The news is noteworthy for its relevance to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), with new small businesses accounting for 30% of “tap” sellers, according to Visa. For these SMBs, Nelsen said, turning a smartphone into a point-of-sale device offers a more level playing field for small businesses. And by not having to invest in new hardware or setting up registers, formerly online-only SMBs have an easier time shifting into the physical, brick-and-mortar realm. “Think about how those SMBs operate and how they’re able to deliver a different consumer experience,” Nelson said. “Think about how they can set up their storefronts in a different way. It is very, very transformative. It’s less about the technology, which is clearly important, and more about the customer experience of walking into that store.” The post Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Apple's new entry-level model, the iPhone 16e, is a better long-term option than the iPhone 15 unless an ultrawide camera is a top priority. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreIt's a common debate each time Apple releases a new iPhone. Is the older, more premium phone a better value than the newer, less premium model? Identifying your priorities can solve the iPhone 16e versus iPhone 15 debate. Do you want the best performance and the latest Apple Intelligence features? Or do you want an ultrawide camera in exchange for an older processor and no Apple Intelligence? Without upgrading to the more premium iPhone 16, you can't have it all. Unless your biggest priority is taking ultrawide photos, the iPhone 16e is the best iPhone for most people between these two models. Despite missing some features, like an ultrawide camera, connectivity for the fastest 5G networks, and MagSafe compatibility, it's still an excellent option with amazing performance relative to its $600 price. Plus, you'll get the latest Apple Intelligence features.The iPhone 15 is also a worthwhile phone that offers a fuller flagship feature set than the iPhone 16e, but not Apple Intelligence. Its ultrawide camera distinguishes it from the iPhone 16e. Yet, its older processor is a trade-off that struggles to justify the $100 price premium over the new entry-level model. iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: SpecsSpecsiPhone 16eiPhone 15Dimensions5.78 × 2.82 × 0.31 inches5.81 × 2.82 × 0.31 inchesDisplay6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLEDProcessorApple A18 (4-core GPU)Apple A16Storage128GB, 256GB, 512GB128GB, 256GB, 512GBWireless chargingQi wireless charging; lacks MagSafe15W MagSafe chargingRear cameras48MP Fusion main48MP main, 12MP ultrawidePrice$599, $699, $899$699, $799, $999iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: Design and buttonsThe iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 look and feel very similar, save for minute differences in dimension (the iPhone 15 is slightly taller).The main visual difference is the iPhone 16e's somewhat dated static display notch, which houses its Face ID sensors and front camera, compared to the iPhone 15's sleeker Dynamic Island, a convenient shape-shifting module for interacting with apps and notifications. The iPhone 16e also has a single camera on the rear, whereas the iPhone 15 has a dual camera system.The iPhone 16e (left) has a display notch and slightly thicker borders compared to the iPhone 15's (right) Dynamic Island and slightly narrower borders.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderThe black borders around the iPhone 16e's display are also slightly thicker than those on the iPhone 15. Still, the iPhone 16e looks like a modern premium phone.The iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 have exactly the same buttons, including the Action button that replaced the iPhone's signature silent switch with the iPhone 15 series. iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: PerformanceIn our benchmark results, the iPhone 16e running on Apple's latest-generation A18 processor is more powerful than the iPhone 15's two-year-old A16 processor. But in day-to-day use, the difference will not be perceivable.That said, the iPhone 16e's quick performance will likely last at least a year longer than the iPhone 15's due to its newer processor. The iPhone 15 might start to open and run apps somewhat slower in about three years, whereas we might expect slower iPhone 16e performance in four.Considering Apple's usual seven-year support window for the iOS operating system, we'd expect the iPhone 16e to be supported until 2032. The iPhone 15, released in September 2023, will likely stop getting support in 2030.For gaming, the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 score about the same in benchmark tests. They also play games as well as each other at similar graphics settings and frame rates. However, the iPhone 16e supports AAA games in the App Store, as well as ray tracing (enhanced lighting effects), while the iPhone 15 doesn't.iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: Apple IntelligenceOnly the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence features thanks to its A18 processor. The iPhone 15 doesn't support Apple Intelligence.The iPhone 16e runs Apple Intelligence features, like ChatGPT integration with Siri.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderThere's no reason to rush or force an iPhone purchase for the sake of Apple Intelligence, especially if the iPhone 15 has features you want that the iPhone 16e doesn't have — namely, the ultrawide camera. Writing Tools and other Apple Intelligence features aren't going anywhere, and every iPhone Apple sells will likely support Apple Intelligence in a year or two.Plus, Apple Intelligence is still in its early stages, and it's continually improving with new features being added over time.The feature that will most likely enhance your iPhone experience is ChatGPT's integration with Siri. If you've previously abandoned Siri for getting answers to questions, the ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence will change that.With that said, the ChatGPT app is available on any iPhone that runs iOS 17 or later, so you can run it on the iPhone 15 with a similar effect as the iPhone 16e with Apple Intelligence. Instead of using Siri to access ChatGPT, you can use the ChatGPT app itself, which also lets you use your voice to ask questions. You can even set the iPhone 15's Action button as a shortcut for ChatGPT voice functionality.It's easy to get used to having Writing Tools write emails for you with Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16e.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderBeyond ChatGPT's integration with Siri, the Writing Tools feature is useful for writing emails for you based on short, descriptive prompts. It's incredibly handy, but it's not a reason on its own to \"downgrade\" to the iPhone 16e or upgrade to the iPhone 16.As noted in our iPhone 16e review and iPhone 16 review, the rest of the current slate of Apple Intelligence features have less overall impact and could use refinement. Read our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 guide for a comparative breakdown of the models.iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: DisplaysBoth iPhone models use Apple's 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with essentially the same resolution and features, like a 60Hz refresh rate and first-generation Ceramic Shield glass.The biggest difference on paper is the iPhone 16e's 1,200 nits peak HDR brightness compared to the iPhone 15's 1,600 nits peak HDR brightness and even 2,000 nits peak brightness outdoors. Despite the iPhone 16e's lower brightness panel, it's just as bright under direct sunlight as the iPhone 15.The iPhone 15 Plus (pictured) has a 6.7-inch display, an option for those who prefer larger displays, while the iPhone 16e is only available in a 6.1-inch option.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderAnother major difference is that the iPhone 16e is only available in a 6.1-inch version. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Plus with a 6.7-inch display is available if you prefer an analogous version of the iPhone 15 with a larger display.iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: CamerasThe iPhone 16e has a single 48MP camera, while the iPhone 15 has a 48MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide camera. Between the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15, you're only losing the ability to take ultrawide shots. Despite its ultrawide camera, the iPhone 15 doesn't support macro photography, like the iPhone 16's ultrawide camera does.The iPhone 15 has an ultrawide camera (bottom) that captures more surrounding details than the main camera at 1x (top).Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderIn day-to-day shooting, there isn't much difference in photo quality between the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15. Both phones can take optical-quality 2x zoom photos, too.The iPhone 16e's single-camera system takes great photos.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderThe iPhone 16e includes optical-quality 2x zoom that captures clear and sharp images.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderYet, there are some minor differences. The iPhone 15 includes sensor-shift optical image stabilization compared to the iPhone 16e's basic optical stabilization. It's barely noticeable while taking photos, and videos taken with the iPhone 16e while you're in motion are only slightly jerkier.The iPhone 15's superior stabilization is only truly appreciable with Action Mode, which isn't available on the iPhone 16e. Action Mode lets you take surprisingly smooth, jitter-free videos, even if you're moving a lot while recording, like while running.The iPhone 15 also supports Apple's next-generation portraits, which include focus and depth control, whereas the iPhone 16e's portrait mode only supports depth control. If you take many portrait mode shots, you'll appreciate the extra control from the iPhone 15.Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 15 includes Cinematic Mode video, which is basically a video portrait mode that records at up to 4K quality and 30 frames per second. To note, the iPhone 16e supports wind noise reduction and Apple's Audio Mix feature, which lets you adjust individual sound levels in videos, while the iPhone 15 lacks either feature. Front cameras are essentially identical 12MP lenses, except the iPhone 15 supports next-generation portrait mode and Cinematic Mode videos taken with the front camera, whereas the iPhone 16e doesn't.iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15: 5G networksThe iPhone 16e supports LTE, low-, and mid-band 5G networks but notably excludes the iPhone 15's support for high-band 5G networks, also known as mmWave 5G.Verizon's mmWave 5G can reach speeds of up to 634 Mbps, while AT&T's can reach 474 Mbps and T-Mobile's 418 Mbps. Considering the high speeds that mmWave 5G networks can achieve, you'd think the iPhone 16e would offer a notably downgraded experience. Yet, it doesn't.Low- and mid-band 5G networks are fast enough for almost anything most people do on their phones, whether that's streaming video or downloading huge games and files. On Verizon, these networks can reach advertised speeds of 143 Mbps, while AT&T's networks can reach 304 Mbp",

        "description": "Apple's acknowledgment that AI enhancements to Siri are taking longer than expected has increased concern that the iPhone maker is falling further behind in what is shaping up to be a tectonic shift for the tech industry.Why it matters: When it announced Apple Intelligence last June, Apple was already trailing major competitors in outlining its AI strategy.Driving the news: Apple confirmed earlier this month that the enhanced Siri was taking longer than expected, with features that were due imminently now expected to arrive \"in the coming year.\"With delivery times up in the air, Apple took down the video of a 2024 ad touting Siri's new AI features. Since then, there have been concerns expressed in and outside the company that Apple may have trouble reaching even these revised goals.Bloomberg has reported that Apple executives called the delay \"ugly\" and \"embarrassing\" in a meeting with worried staffers.Between the lines: While Apple has shipped the first pieces of Apple Intelligence, what has yet to arrive are the components that really made the strategy compelling — the notion of combining AI smarts with personal data in a secure and privacy-preserving way.The features that Apple has delivered — custom emoji, Image Playground, writing help and ChatGPT integration — fit more in the nice-to-have bucket. And in some cases, those features still lag behind what's available from others.The features that are delayed, meanwhile, are the ones that generated the most excitement during last year's demo. For example, Apple showed Siri answering \"when does my mom's flight land?\" by drawing upon various pieces of knowledge across the system within multiple apps. That ability to understand personal relationships, context and retrieve personal information was what made Apple Intelligence stand out from rivals.The big picture: While Apple has struggled with its AI efforts, the industry is barreling forward with unprecedented speed.Even Amazon, which has had its own set of challenges, announced in February its plans for Alexa+, an AI-infused upgrade to its voice assistant.On the personalization front, Google last week debuted an option for users to integrate their search history with Gemini and Microsoft managed at long last to ship its Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs.And the whole industry has added new techniques that have leap-frogged what chatbots could do last year. Among those are reasoning models, semi-autonomous agents and the ability to do deep research.What they're saying: Industry observers have been pulling no punches in describing what the delay could mean for Apple's future. Daring Fireball's John Gruber thrashed Apple, arguing that not only is the company late with AI, but it has now broken its long, enviable record of only promoting products when they are ready to ship.\"The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI,\" Gruber wrote. \"It's also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen.\"\"The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn't true, one that some people within the company surely understood wasn't true, and they set a course based on that.\" Apple's acknowledgment that AI enhancements to Siri are taking longer than expected has increased concern that the iPhone maker is falling further behind in what is shaping up to be a tectonic shift for the tech industry.Why it matters: When it announced Apple Intelligence last June, Apple was already trailing major competitors in outlining its AI strategy.Driving the news: Apple confirmed earlier this month that the enhanced Siri was taking longer than expected, with features that were due imminently now expected to arrive \"in the coming year.\"With delivery times up in the air, Apple took down the video of a 2024 ad touting Siri's new AI features.

        "description": "In case you didn’t know, End to End Encryption or E2EE for RCS messaging is one step closer to becoming a reality. The news comes after the driving force governing body behind this standard, GSMA, shared that it’s ready for launch. Now that does not mean it’s going to pop up across all iPhone and Android phones this afternoon. However, we know that Apple is committed to rolling this out as soon as possible. A new statement was shared on this front by 9to5Mac, who mentioned that Apple is excited to provide support for E2EE to RCS Universal Profile. They hope to include it for all iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in the next software update, which is major news.For those wondering, RCS or rich communication services gives texters the chance to send and receive top quality media and also enable features such as read receipts. Moreover, texts from Android pop up in the color green, but you can see how and when there are typing indicators on the iPhone device.Google first shared RCS in the year 2019 and then we went on to see Apple include it to all phones with iOS 18 last year in fall. The Android maker similarly offers E2EE for RCS messaging between Android users through the Google Messages platform. However, Phone to Android RCS chats can only encrypt texts in transit, not E2E. Therefore, this puts texts at risk of being intercepted.As shared in September, the GSMA put out teasers for E2EE coming to both iOS and Android but later mentioned how it might take a couple of months. This looks like the day has come. The announcement of the latest GSMA specifications for RCS is up for grabs with E2EE depending on the MLS protocol.This ensures all the messages and other content files remain encrypted and private when traveling from one device to the next. Moreover, RCS takes pride in being the large-scale messaging service to provide support for interoperable E2EE between various providers. As a whole, E2EE provides RCS users with the best privacy and security for stronger protections against fraud and scams and other types of security threats. Google says it’s excited to have such a unique and robust specification up for grabs. They will be working closely with the desired authorities to implement this user protection for all types of cross-platform messaging through RCS. The report comes just a short while after we witnessed the FBI urge US citizens to make use of encrypted services for messaging after the infamous Salt Typhoon incident that breached over nine leading telecom companies in America. That was a huge eye opener for the world. It proved how important encryption was for secure cross-platform messaging and putting an end to privacy risks.

        "description": "A hearing in the Apple legal battle with the British government regarding access to user data was recently held behind closed doors. The news comes just one day after we saw privacy groups in the UK demand the proceedings be done more transparently as the public’s rights were at stake. Despite that, the press failed to get entry into the courtroom and was denied access.The American tech giant rolled out an appeal against the decision made by the tribunal regarding the Home Office’s decision to demand encrypted data that’s found on Apple’s iCloud servers. Many media outlets, including the BBC, Computer Weekly, and the Guardian, made submissions for entry, but that did not go as planned and they were denied entry.It was interesting to see Sir James Eadie, who usually represents the government in top cases, make an entry to the courtroom for this hearing. The iPhone maker is fighting a tech capability notice rolled out under the nation’s Investigatory Powers Act. This forces organizations to help different law enforcement agencies in getting evidence. This notice demands access to the company’s ADP service that focuses mostly on highly sensitive encrypted data belonging to users that is stored remotely across servers.Apple shared how it was not in favor of the decision. Therefore, the order was challenged at the tribunal, which is designed to determine if the domestic challenge service act as per law or not. The news comes after the Cupertino firm chose to withdraw from the ADP in February this year. Apple time and time again reiterates how it never designed a backdoor or any kind of master key for products and will never be following this kind of practice in the future as well.The ADP makes use of E2E, which means only account holders get the chance for file decryption. Meanwhile, messaging services like iMessage and FaceTime continue to be E2E through default means.The government’s hidden legal demands are commonly known as a tech capability notice or TCN. Therefore, recipients of this TCN can’t share the existence of this order until they’re provided with permission from the home secretary. The website also spoke about how hearings should be dealt with in private only when it’s deemed absolutely necessary to do so. It also mentioned how there needs to be zero information disclosure that might be a threat to the country’s national security. Two days back, American lawmakers were seen calling on the tribunal to get rid of this cloak of secrecy related to the British government’s order and make Friday’s hearing public.As per a recent report from Bloomberg, officials in the UK rolled out talks with American counterparts regarding this order. Therefore, the UK continues to assure America that it’s not getting any kind of blanket access. It only wishes for data related to serious criminal offenses or terrorist attacks, or matters linked to abuse.

        "description": "A member of the NYPD Pipes and Drums uses an iPhone to check bagpipe pitch ahead of a St. Patrick's Day Parade.Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesiPhone sales have flatlined for a decade, and Siri has sucked for about as long.And yet, Apple has added roughly trillions of dollars in market value during that time.It's time to think of Apple as more like a utility.It's time to think differently about Apple.The company is becoming a utility, which is hard for fanboys to accept, though it's not all bad.The iPhone has become the standard tool for accessing online data and running our lives. Most owners don't care about cutting-edge AI or the latest speedy chip. They just need the device to keep working.Apple fans have been aflutter lately over the company's decision to postpone new AI features, with some analysts predicting lower iPhone sales as a result.That may be important for a tiny fraction of customers, such as Apple bloggers and the odd person who absolutely needs the latest and greatest iPhone. For everyone else, we don't care. We mostly want the battery to last all day, our apps to run, our texts to go through, and a camera to just work. This can be done with any iPhone, and it doesn't need AI.Similar to an electric utility, we rely on the iPhone a lot. Most of us don't think about it passionately until something goes wrong. That's usually the battery degrading. Or when Apple updates the operating system, and a few older iPhones no longer work. Or you damage it beyond repair, or it gets stolen.This drives an iPhone upgrade cycle that has become incredibly powerful and has little to do with fancy new AI features. Eventually, every one of the roughly 1.5 billion iPhones out there will have to be replaced.\"300 million iPhones have not upgraded in over four years,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote recently in an email to Business Insider. \"That's a lot of pent-up demand.\"This is the main driver of iPhone sales now. It's not that sexy, and it's not high growth. Instead, it's big and steady, like a utility.A chart showing iPhone unit sales.Dan Morgan, Synovus, and data compiled by Bloomberg. Red = estimate.The chart above, based on data compiled by Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus, shows that iPhone sales have flatlined for a decade.That seems bad. However, Apple shares have soared sevenfold in the last decade, massively outperforming the broader stock market. It's the most valuable public company in the world. By a lot.During that same time, Siri — Apple's main AI offering — has sucked pretty hard. How much did that derail the iPhone upgrade train? Not much, judging by the data above.Apple did not respond to a request for comment from BI.Why Warren Buffett likes utilities and AppleApple CEO Tim Cook walks with Astrid Buffett, Warren Buffett's wife, during the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Idaho.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesWarren Buffett, a massive utility investor, remains one of Apple's largest shareholders. In his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he listed Apple alongside other unsexy, non-AI companies, such as American Express, Coca-Cola, and Moody's.He seems blissfully uninterested in the latest whizz-bang Apple technology and how that might help sell more iPhones in a given quarter.\"The idea that spending loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X or whatever are going to be sold in a given three-month period, to me, it totally misses the point,\" Buffett said in 2018.Buffett likes Apple for similar reasons he loves utilities and other vaguely boring, profitable companies. Many people need what these companies sell, which helps them generate large, reliable returns — including juicy dividends.'Panic' on the streets of Silicon ValleyA panicked human. Where's his iPhone?izusek/Getty ImagesElectricity. Water. An iPhone. These are essential ingredients for modern life. Without them, things can get difficult quickly. Take my family's experience as an example.My wife's iPhone was stolen last year. She only waited a few hours before driving to the nearest Apple store to hand over almost $1,000 for a replacement. She described the thought of existing without an iPhone as \"panic.\"First up: She used two-factor authentication via her iPhone to access sensitive work documents. She couldn't work without a new Apple device. (She's added a backup now. Guess what it is? An iPad!)Then, a long list of other practical tasks revealed themselves to be difficult without an iPhone: Booking an exercise class, texting a group of friends, keeping streaks going on mobile games, and accessing the iPhone's digital wallet for tickets she needed soon.My daughter broke her iPhone beyond repair last year. She experienced similar panic and bought a replacement from Apple within 24 hours.She uses a mobile app on her iPhone to authenticate and access her college accounts for submitting homework and doing other study-related stuff. She also had a plane to catch and was worried about not having the digital ticket.My wife and daughter both worried about the data on their iPhones and thought it would be safer and easier to get a new iPhone to reclaim this digital information.This year, my iPhone SE's battery started running low, and I struggled to hear people well on phone calls. These problems were fixable and probably related to user error. I could have gotten a new battery from Apple, for instance, yet I just could not be bothered. So I bought a new iPhone 16e. It was so easy, and my life was uninterrupted. I did not think about AI once during this process.Android switching doesn't really happen anymoreMy wife, my daughter, and I did not ever once consider getting an Android phone instead. For many non-technical consumers, switching is too complex.My wife knew her stolen iPhone was backed up in Apple's iCloud, so getting the same device again made the replacement process much quicker and smoother.\"I knew that if I bought another one, it would be as painless as possible to access my photos, wallet, apps, contacts, etc,\" she told me. \"I was already pained by the stolen iPhone. Switching to Android at that moment made no sense. I'd have been breaking myself into jail.\"A 2023 study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that only about 4% of Android phone buyers switched from an iPhone. The authors wrote that a big reason was \"fear of the complexity of switching.\"\"There's not a lot of iOS-to-Android switching,\" said Josh Lowitz, a partner at CIRP. \"Switching between platforms is not that difficult, but the habits and iOS-specific apps and connections are hard to leave.\"This is why a year or so of delay in AI features won't matter much. When everyone's iPhone stops working, they will buy another, with or without AI.So we should watch: How many old iPhones will Apple stop supporting? The company does an amazing job keeping these devices running for years. But after a certain point, the hardware just can't keep up.That's when some handsets are dropped from iOS. Later this year, probably in September, Apple will do this again, and millions of people will have to pay to upgrade — just like I have to keep paying PG&E to pump electricity and natural gas into my house. All is not lostThis is a long way from the cutting-edge technology that Apple fanboys love to nerd out about. There hasn't been much to get excited about lately on that front. Apple scrapped its car project. The Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles have flopped so far. And now, these AI delays show how far Apple lags behind Google, Meta, and OpenAI.All is not lost, though. If Apple were a true utility, regulators would cap what it charges customers, which would probably crush the stock.Instead, Apple can charge what it wants for iPhones. Take the latest example. The cheapest version of the new iPhone 16e costs $170 more than the last entry-level iPhone, the SE. That's 40% inflation in the base cost to access your digital life.\"Without a new iPhone SE, current iPhone SE owners will likely hold on to their phones a little longer,\" said CIRP's Lowitz. \"When they need to get a new phone, they will likely buy the most affordable new iPhone.\"What an incredible business. No wonder Apple has become the world's most valuable company — with or without AI.Read the original article on Business Insider A member of the NYPD Pipes and Drums uses an iPhone to check bagpipe pitch ahead of a St. Patrick's Day Parade.Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesiPhone sales have flatlined for a decade, and Siri has sucked for about as long.And yet, Apple has added roughly trillions of dollars in market value during that time.It's time to think of Apple as more like a utility.It's time to think differently about Apple.The company is becoming a utility, which is hard for fanboys to accept, though it's not all bad.The iPhone has become the standard tool for accessing online data and running our lives.

        "description": "Lack of encryption was one SMS shortcoming that RCS was created to solve. One of the best mostly invisible updates in iOS 18 was Apple's decision to finally implement the Rich Communications Services (RCS) communication protocol, something that is slowly helping to fix the generally miserable experience of texting non-iPhone users with an iPhone. The initial iOS 18 update brought RCS support to most major carriers in the US, and the upcoming iOS 18.4 update is turning it on for a bunch of smaller prepaid carriers like Google Fi and Mint Mobile. Now that Apple is on board, iPhones and their users can also benefit from continued improvements to the RCS standard. And one major update was announced today: RCS will now support end-to-end encryption using the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, a standard finalized by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 2023. \"RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers,\" writes GSMA Technical Director Tom Van Pelt in the post announcing the updates. \"Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats. \"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Before I go any further, a programming note: On Thursday, March 27 at 1 p.m. ET, my colleague Max Ufberg and I will host “The AI Tools We Love Right Now—and What’s Next,” an online event exclusively for Fast Company Premium subscribers. We’ll discuss the AI-assisted productivity products that are actually helping us get our jobs done, and where we’d like to see the whole category go. Fast Company Premium subscribers can RSVP here. And if you aren’t yet a subscriber, here’s where you can become one. Hope to see you there! When I first got excited by Siri, it wasn’t part of Apple, let alone the iPhone. At the time—February 2010—it was just promising a stand-alone iPhone app from a startup that had been spun out of Silicon Valley R&D icon SRI, drawing on its research collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA lab. Almost three months elapsed before Apple acquired Siri, and another year and a half until the company built it into iOS, starting with a beta version on the iPhone 4s. I was excited about that, too, calling it “breathtaking for a beta” and adding, ”If voice-activated assistants are all around us in five or ten years, we’ll look back and say it all started here.” They were, and we did. Screenshots I took of Siri in February 2010, well before it was a standard iPhone feature. (It still can’t help book flights.) But long before Siri celebrated its fifth birthday, its reputation foundered. Even early on, much analysis of the voice assistant deemed it a disappointment, often expressing the hope that Apple would eventually give it a transformative upgrade. Over time, oceans of wordage were dedicated to the topic. More than 15 years after I first gave Siri a try, it’s still waiting for its big, game-changing update. In this case, the update in question is the more “natural, relevant, personal” version that Apple previewed last June as part of “Apple Intelligence” during its WWDC keynote. It still hasn’t shipped. And on Friday, the company announced that work on the update was taking “longer than we thought” and the release wouldn’t happen until sometime in “the coming year.” The most logical guess: It will be rolled into iOS 19 and MacOS 16, which should ship this fall. Over at Daring Fireball, John Gruber has a long and acidic account of the delay and its implications. In brief: Apple seems to have repeatedly shown off stuff so far from completion that it wasn’t even ready for live demos. Eventually, the company concluded that it was in over its head—for reasons it hasn’t explained, and won’t—and pushed the release off to some unspecified date. There’s a name for products like that: vaporware. The tech industry is rife with examples. Apple, in its modern history, has been atypically disciplined about avoiding them—which makes this incident only more striking. Now, it’s easy to understand how Apple bit off a more ambitious upgrade than it could chew its way through as quickly as expected. The new Siri is designed to respond to free-form requests such as “Send Erica the photos from Saturday’s barbecue,” a big leap from the assistant’s history of only understanding a limited set of instructions expressed in a precise way. Along with requiring greater language skills, the new Siri will sift through your email, calendar, contacts, notes, photos, and other information stored on your device in ways that haven’t been done before. All this is the most interesting use of AI that Apple has announced, and also the most ambitious. It’s literally something only Apple could do. No other company has enough access to iOS to dream of building it—though as my colleague Jared Newman explained last June, it also held the potential to make third-party apps way more Siri-friendly than in the past. But for all of the new Siri’s potential, it also feels like something that Apple was scrambling to release as proof it isn’t behind in AI. The generative AI boom unleashed more than two years ago by ChatGPT has left the company in an unusually reactive mode, as it plays catch-up in areas such as image generation. A much better Siri might have taken Apple far beyond me-too territory. It still could. With the delay, however, the company only looks more like it doesn’t yet have a handle on AI and how to make the most of it in Apple products. I can’t help but think, though, that Apple’s failure to get the new Siri out the door isn’t just about the challenge of doing AI in a way that’s useful, reliable, and safe. It’s part of the much larger, longer story of Siri being full of promise and only sporadically living up to it. I see two other specific factors at play. Part of Apple’s 2024 preview of the “new era for Siri.” [Screenshot: Apple] Factor one: Apple may be overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of software updates it tries to pump out each year. In the pre-iPhone era, the company had only one operating system to wrangle—MacOS, then known as OS X—and didn’t attempt to update it on a set timetable. Now it’s put itself on a yearly schedule and must juggle upgrades for MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, tvOS, and VisionOS. Of course that’s tough. It’s no shocker that certain elements might suffer from insufficient resource allocation: More often than not, for instance, my beloved iPad feels neglected from a software standpoint. And Apple TV—theoretically a core Apple product in the streaming age—remains a little-changing hobby. Artificial intelligence must be the furthest thing from an area Apple feels it can safely deprioritize. But it’s also among the most demanding. The company may simply have had too many things going on at once to adequately focus on Siri, even after bragging about the new version during its WWDC and iPhone 16 keynotes. Factor two: On some level I don’t quite understand, Apple may never quite have emotionally bonded with Siri. How else to explain the company’s failure to do all that much with it over all these years? Acquiring Siri in 2010 was prescient. So was building it into the iPhone. If Apple had pushed ahead with the feature as ambitiously as possible, iOS might look quite different today. Apple might even have a reputation for being ahead in AI. But maybe Siri simply took it out of its comfort zone of polished visuals, touch input, consistent experiences, and the other elements that made the iPhone such a landmark. Declaring that Siri was headed for “a new era,” showing it off in splashy canned presentations, and then kicking the can down the road is one of the more embarrassing predicaments Apple has created for itself in recent years. Despite that, I think the delay was sensible. It’s more important that Siri be great than that it arrive on time. And having waited for it to be great since 2011, we can surely wait a little longer.

        "description": "Privacy groups are being very vocal about the highly controversial legal battle of Apple against the UK Government for the creation of a secret backdoor to iCloud. Many hold the opinion that this feature would make encryption weak and put their private data at risk of getting accessible to others. Now, the IPT will be hearing Apple’s appeal today but various privacy groups want to make sure that such a case isn’t fought behind closed doors as it has the public’s best interests involved. The legal battle demands the iPhone maker produce a tech accessibility in the form of a backdoor that only provides the government officials access to iCloud data that is protected by encryption. The Cupertino firm has already issued a mighty reply in this context by pulling the ADP feature out for those in the country. However, we’re not sure if that is enough to make the government happy or ticks their list of demands.Recently, several different rights groups including Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group, and Index on Censorship were seen jointly writing to the IPT and forcing it to hold hearings in the public eye.Such cases implicate the privacy rights of millions of UK citizens located in the country as well as around the globe. Many people want to know the end result and have every right to, the groups claim. After all, their privacy and security are on the line. The group keeps arguing about how the case does not meet the legal thresholds of privacy and is also focused on how surveillance orders are not something hidden. So there is no reason why there should be a limit on transparency for this case.This is far from the first time that we’ve seen Apple face immense pressure to make encryption weak. In 2016, we saw the American FBI put pressure to create a similar backdoor during the infamous San Bernardino lawsuit, warning how such tools could be misused. Meanwhile, Apple is getting praise and support from many, including International legal precedents like the ECtHR, who ruled against the decision. They felt that making encryption weaker really affects users’ rights. They also felt it was inadequate for any government to make such orders to begin with.So now, it’s the UK Government against privacy rights groups who challenge the case and want more secrecy. Others demand that all the legal arguments must be shared in the public eye as they don’t risk losing out on any sensitive data.They also stress how the government’s policy or refusing to confirm or deny matters makes things worse and shouldn’t be applicable here. It’s a case that entails public attempts designed to weaken encryption for so many users around the globe.

        "description": "Other iPads are nicer and faster, but I end up using all of them the same way. Apple released a new version of the basic $349 iPad this week, though you could be forgiven for not noticing. The new 11th-generation iPad (also known as the \"iPad (A16)\" or just plain-old \"iPad\") looks identical to the previous version, it was introduced in a single paragraph buried in the middle of an iPad Air announcement, and the company didn't offer to send any to reviewers. The one I have I bought myself for our 5-year-old, whose hand-me-down 2019 iPad Air 3 is slightly older than he is and a little worse for wear. There's nothing exciting or even particularly interesting about this tablet. The design is recycled from 2022's 10th-generation iPad, which was itself a lower-rent version of the 2020 iPad Air design. It's powered by a variant of the Apple A16, originally an iPhone chip from 2022. It still doesn't support the regular Apple Pencil or Pencil Pro or the same keyboard accessories as other iPads. It still doesn't have an anti-reflective screen coating, and the screen doesn't feel as nice to use as an iPad Air's or Pro's. But for all that, this is still probably the purest expression of what the iPad is: a cheap Internet-connected screen for reading and watching things. I say this as someone who has tried every new piece of hardware and software that Apple has introduced to try and make the iPad a powerful and versatile laptop replacement—it still feels like trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. The more expensive iPads are nice, but I don't end up using them much differently from how I use this bare-bones tablet.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "As the 30th season of Major League Soccer (MLS) kicked off last month, the league unveiled an interesting new design addition: Each of its 30 teams sported a custom Apple TV logo on the left sleeve of its uniform featuring the colors and graphic elements of the team’s identity incorporated within the familiar Apple icon. For example, the Chicago Fire version includes the six-pointed star from the city’s flag and the team’s crest, while Atlanta United’s is filled with the characteristic five red and black stripes that adorn the club’s shirt. This effort, part of MLS’s 10-year deal with Apple to stream the league’s matches, represents an innovative step forward in its approach to co-branding. Branding has come a long way from the days of the corporate identity manual strictly dictating how a logo could be used. Although today’s brand guidelines, such as the set released earlier this year by Cash App, often still admonish “Do not alter the logo” and “Do not use with unapproved colors,” there are now caveats: As the Cash App document puts it, “All of the above rules can be disregarded when creating illustrative treatments of the logo for marketing/promotional purposes. In this context, we encourage experimentation and favor expression over restraint.” [Images: Apple] So it’s not surprising that Apple might allow for so many new variations of its logo. But unlike the flexible logo approach pioneered by MTV, or even the identity systems used by MLS and Major League Baseball, in which each team gets a version of the league logo in its own colors (the MLS version sits right above the Apple TV logo on the left sleeve), these latest co-branded little apples are notable in that they represent the outcome of a sort of logo alchemy in which the design components of altogether separate organizations have been recombined into new forms, in a novel way of visually denoting partnerships between brands. They are like the fanciful and unofficial “logo mash-ups” that one can find online suddenly made real. Over history, various sorts of graphically symbolic expressions of partnership or collaboration between different entities have been employed. A friendship between two nations, for example, might simply be represented by a depiction of their two flags crossed at the staffs. In European heraldry, alliances between families through marriage could be expressed by “quartering” a heraldic shield—dividing it into four parts, with the symbols of each family occupying two parts apiece. This explains why the state flag of Maryland is such a glorious mess; it is the banner of arms of Lord Baltimore, with the colors of the Calvert family in the first and fourth quarters, and those of the Crossland family in the second and third. Recent years have seen the emergence of collaborations between brands that are frequently expressed by placing an “x” between the two brand names or logos, as in “Nike x Supreme,” with the “x” often standing for the word “by.” The “x” not only recalls the alliance implied by crossed flagstaffs, but it levels up from mere addition to the more synergistically powerful mathematical operation of multiplication. Other contemporary brand collabs, though, employ division, displaying the logos of the partners separated by a thin vertical line (as Apple Watch did with Nike). Sometimes, though, certain brands and logos are not suited well to sitting next to each other. For instance, when the University of Utah, whose school color is red, named Pepsi its “official beverage provider” in 2017, it came with the stipulation that Pepsi downplay its signature blue color, which is similar to that of Utah’s rival, Brigham Young University. It’s this sort of graphic discrepancy that undermines to some degree Apple’s audacious co-branding with MLS. The relatively small size of the teams’ Apple TV logos and the resulting limitations on the graphic imagery that can be used with them—as well as the fact that they are often the same color as the shirt on which they appear—can make them difficult to see. But, perhaps as with the Maryland flag, the point is ultimately not aesthetic but relational. By creating these 30 junior versions of its logo, Apple is signaling camaraderie with MLS fans in hopes of engendering their goodwill.",

Visa will soon add tokenization and custom provisioning for mobile transactions to its Fleet cards, enabling issuers and FinTechs to integrate encrypted and tokenized card information into Apple Pay mobile wallets. With this capability, issuers and FinTechs will be able to provide a seamless and secure experience for commercial fleet drivers and fleet managers, Gloria Colgan, global head of products, Visa Commercial Solutions, wrote in an article posted Thursday (March 13) on LinkedIn. These enhancements will allow fleet data tags to be provided during the token provisioning process so that they and the token payment data can be passed to the point of sale, and will enable digital credentials to be pushed into mobile wallets, card-on-file merchants and Click to Pay to reduce the time to market, according to the article. The enhancements will be made generally available “soon,” per the article. “This innovation solves for a clear pain point within fleet today and allows for a plethora of client benefits, including instant issuance, a more seamless user experience for drivers, and robust controls and provisions for fleet managers,” Colgan said in the article. When the new enhancements were piloted from April to November, Highnote, a U.S.-based issuer-processor and program manager, participated and found that they help “put the power of payments into the hands of fleet drivers everywhere,” Highnote CEO and co-founder John MacIlwaine said in the article. “The world of fleet payments has represented the biggest opportunity to benefit from modernization,” MacIlwaine said. “Thanks to the power of payments innovation that’s quickly changing.” Digital wallets have introduced a more streamlined, secure and efficient way of conducting B2B payments. The integration of virtual cards with digital wallets gives chief financial officers the ability to control corporate spending, especially unplanned spending. A virtual corporate card can be provisioned directly to a digital wallet on an employee’s mobile phone, managed by the company and enabling contactless digital payments. “We have multiple tools in the toolkit, from an internal perspective, and as well as a partnership perspective, to expand acceptance on the commercial front,” Colgan told PYMNTS in an interview posted in August 2023.

        "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook said last spring that his company had all kinds of big AI plans. Many of them have yet to materialize.Kara Durrette/Getty ImagesApple was late to AI. But last spring it said it was catching up and promised all kinds of AI features.Many of those have yet to materialize, and close Apple watchers are wondering if Apple will ever deliver them.Maybe Apple eventually shrugs this off. But when people like Apple blogger John Gruber are publicly shaming the company, you know something's up.Do you remember when Apple told the world it was going to bring artificial intelligence to its phones, which would allow them to do all kinds of amazing things?That was last June. And, it turns out, a bunch of the stuff Apple promised was coming has yet to show up, and now may not show up for some time — if ever.If you're a normal person, you probably don't care about this. But for close Apple watchers and Apple fans, this has become an increasingly big problem: It is making them wonder if Apple made a distinctly un-Apple-like mistake last year, by showing off stuff it doesn't know how to deliver.And that has them worrying about the state of Apple itself.That crisis of faith materialized most prominently on Wednesday, via a blistering post from John Gruber, the influential Apple blogger. The title gets right at it: \"Something is Rotten in the State of Cupertino.\"Gruber's argument boiled down: Apple hasn't shipped the most consequential features it showed off in June 2024 — like the ability for the phone to sift through your emails and texts, and to tell you when your mom is arriving at the airport. More worrisome is Gruber's belief that Apple doesn't actually know how to deliver that kind of feature, and that what it showed off last spring was mere \"vaporware\" — perhaps the most damning thing you can say about an Apple product.Even more worrisome: It wasn't just that Apple showed this stuff off at a developer conference — it has been telling normal people that these features are coming soon, via an ad campaign they have now shelved.Add it all up, Gruber says, and it points to a deep malaise at the company — one he says is ultimately a problem for CEO Tim Cook. If Cook can't figure it out immediately, Gruber argues, \"then, I fear, that's all she wrote. The ride is over.\"\"When mediocrity, excuses, and bulls—t take root, they take over,\" he continued. \"A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.\"Gruber isn't the only one worried about the state of Apple's AI efforts. Earlier this week analyst Ben Thompson noted the delays and concluded, \"It appears Apple tried to do too much all at once.\"These critiques have been building for some time: Last November, Marques Brownlee, the hyper-popular tech reviewer, assessed the AI features that Apple had rolled out by then and was unimpressed. \"Apple's made this promise that this huge thing is coming,\" he said. \"I think that promise is starting to fade.\"I've asked Apple for comment.Does any of this matter in the real world? Maybe. Apple's stock is down 10% this week — double the decline that the broader Nasdaq has seen. Of course, there are other reasons for investors to be concerned about Apple — namely, the specter of a trade war that could dramatically increase costs for Apple's supply chain, which is highly dependent on China.That said: A year ago, Google was in the midst of what seemed like an existential crisis as it stumbled through its own AI rollout — you may recall embarrassing \"woke\" results from its Gemini chatbot or equally embarrassing answers about putting glue on your pizza. But Google kept at it, and for better or worse, Google now gives you AI-generated answers much of the time, whether you want them or not.It's also possible that Apple can simply sidestep this problem entirely by leaving the AI to companies that spent a gazillion dollars chasing AI, and focusing on what Apple does really well: making high-end hardware at scale.Analysts are excited about new Apple devices — like a newly released desktop PC that's supposed to work really well with the computing demands state-of-the-art AI requires.\"Apple doesn't need to have its own industry-leading AI s—t. Not right now at least. That'd be great if they did, but it's fine if they don't,\" Gruber tells me via email.\"What Apple has are the best platforms to use AI from anyone. Best phone to use ChatGPT is iPhone. Best phone to use Claude or Perplexity is iPhone. ChatGPT has a fantastic native Mac app. Even Google makes a really good Gemini app for iPhone… Apple should be hammering that.\"What's a bit strange is that \"Apple makes good hardware for other people's AI\" was, in fact, a major component of Apple's AI pitch last year, and people like Thompson thought that was quite smart.\"Having an interface for the folks that want to spend billions of dollars to do these huge large language models, to plug in and sort of take it or leave it — it's Apple leveraging their position of being the trusted device in people's lives, and getting everyone to dance to their tune,\" he told me last spring.Could Apple just focus on that version of AI, instead of trying to play catchup to everyone else? It would be very unlike Apple to pull an about-face and announce that a very big thing they promised was never going to happen. It's also very unlike Apple to get this kind of grief from some of its biggest fans.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple CEO Tim Cook said last spring that his company had all kinds of big AI plans.

More worrisome is Gruber's belief that Apple doesn't actually know how to deliver that kind of feature, and that what it showed off last spring was mere \"vaporware\" — perhaps the most damning thing you can say about an Apple product.Even more worrisome: It wasn't just that Apple showed this stuff off at a developer conference — it has been telling normal people that these features are coming soon, via an ad campaign they have now shelved.Add it all up, Gruber says, and it points to a deep malaise at the company — one he says is ultimately a problem for CEO Tim Cook. If Cook can't figure it out immediately, Gruber argues, \"then, I fear, that's all she wrote. The ride is over.\"\"When mediocrity, excuses, and bulls—t take root, they take over,\" he continued. \"A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.\"Gruber isn't the only one worried about the state of Apple's AI efforts. Earlier this week analyst Ben Thompson noted the delays and concluded, \"It appears Apple tried to do too much all at once.\"These critiques have been building for some time: Last November, Marques Brownlee, the hyper-popular tech reviewer, assessed the AI features that Apple had rolled out by then and was unimpressed. \"Apple's made this promise that this huge thing is coming,\" he said. \"I think that promise is starting to fade.\"I've asked Apple for comment.Does any of this matter in the real world? Maybe. Apple's stock is down 10% this week — double the decline that the broader Nasdaq has seen. Of course, there are other reasons for investors to be concerned about Apple — namely, the specter of a trade war that could dramatically increase costs for Apple's supply chain, which is highly dependent on China.That said: A year ago, Google was in the midst of what seemed like an existential crisis as it stumbled through its own AI rollout — you may recall embarrassing \"woke\" results from its Gemini chatbot or equally embarrassing answers about putting glue on your pizza. But Google kept at it, and for better or worse, Google now gives you AI-generated answers much of the time, whether you want them or not.It's also possible that Apple can simply sidestep this problem entirely by leaving the AI to companies that spent a gazillion dollars chasing AI, and focusing on what Apple does really well: making high-end hardware at scale.Analysts are excited about new Apple devices — like a newly released desktop PC that's supposed to work really well with the computing demands state-of-the-art AI requires.\"Apple doesn't need to have its own industry-leading AI s—t. Not right now at least. That'd be great if they did, but it's fine if th",

        "description": "The UK competition watchdog, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), just concluded an investigation involving Google and Apple mobile browsers. They claim that these mobile duopoly policies are restricting innovation and might even limit economic growth.Mobile browsers are apps that help people go online using their phones and allow businesses to share content and products. The report warns that users might not get the latest browser features, and businesses struggle to connect with them. Many concerns focus on Apple's rules that control how web browsing works on its devices. Apple requires other iOS browsers to use its WebKit engine, preventing them from adding unique features to compete with Safari. Safari also gets earlier access to important tools, making it harder for rivals to keep up, especially with privacy and web app development. Restrictions on in-browser use limit how rival browsers handle links, and certain design choices further reduce competition.As far as Google is concerned, the investigation showed a lot of concerns linked to revenue sharing between Apple and Mountain View tech giant. In this deal, Google pays the iPhone maker a huge amount of the advertising revenue linked to search that comes through traffic via Chrome and Safari for iOS.Apple and Google make a lot of money when people use their competitor’s browser on iOS to search on Google. Because they share this money, they have little reason to compete and improve their browsers.Despite all of the findings that they shared, there are no kinds of actions for enforcement of competition. This is why the investigation warrants waiting for a special type of abuse control power to come into play to keep the situation at bay. A previous inquiry also examined cloud gaming, but it was dropped after Apple made changes that addressed competition concerns. Apple and Google also tweaked how users set default browsers, resolving some issues, though concerns remain about design choices that may discourage switching from Safari and Chrome.The report suggests possible fixes, like allowing different browser engines on iOS, ensuring fair access to iOS features, and banning Google’s revenue-sharing model. It also proposes regulating how Google presents browser choice screens to users.None of these fixes are being enforced yet, but they might guide future actions if Apple and Google are officially labeled as having too much market power. The final decision on this status is expected later this year.Apple responded by saying it values competition but believes the proposed changes would hurt user privacy and security. Google emphasized Android’s openness and its commitment to fair regulations that support innovation.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Google Chrome Bans Extensions Injecting Affiliate Codes, Targeting PayPal Honey's Practices",

        "description": "One of the wonderful things about watching AppleTV’s Severance is seeing the variety of “employee appreciation events” they throw. Each one worse than the last, but they provide wonderful satire of the flat attempts many companies make to demonstrate to their employees that they are valued. The truth is that employee appreciation is not shown by any event. It turns out that if you want the people who work in an organization to feel appreciated, you need to show that they are respected and valued every day. Managers should not wait for special occasions to say nice things about their employees’ performance. Instead, leaders need to be looking for chances to compliment excellence, effort, and improvement all the time. It is particularly important that significant recognition, praise, and rewards be given to people whose actions and ethos are aligned with the mission of the organization. When visible awards and praise go to people who are widely known to be favorites of management rather than to great team players, that undermines people’s belief that leaders care about the values they talk about. Intrinsic versus extrinsic rewards Psychologists have long distinguished between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Intrinsic rewards reflect the joy of engaging in a particular activity. For example, you might read often because you genuinely love engaging with a good book. Extrinsic rewards are rewards given that are independent of the activity itself. If someone paid me $5 for every book I read, that would be an extrinsic reward. The danger with extrinsic rewards is that people pursue the activity for that reward, and will often stop doing it when the reward is taken away. In fact, extrinsic rewards can sometimes interfere with people’s ability to learn that an activity is intrinsically rewarding. There is a parallel with employee appreciation. Authentic employee appreciation is embedded in the daily workflow in a way that feels connected (or intrinsic) to the work itself. Supervisors should regularly catch people doing good things and give them positive feedback. Highlighting great work during team meetings and in email updates is also valuable. What authentic appreciation looks like When compliments are freely given to acknowledge significant contributions, then other employee rewards often feel more authentic. Still, it’s useful for organizations to think about ways to provide perks that are consistent with their brand and mission. For example, I have seen leaders at my university use tickets to sporting events and other events on campus to reward service that goes beyond the call of duty. Rewards ring hollow when they feel separated from the work itself. When leaders routinely lead by creating fear, and fail to acknowledge great work, then any reward—even ones that are on-brand—will still feel forced and inauthentic. On top of that, the rewards given to employees should feel like actual rewards. Holding a party after hours to honor people who have done great work may create a burden for those who have long commutes home or family obligations to attend to. Sending out gift baskets of food that get dietary restrictions of employees wrong is also a problem, because it signals you don’t really know the people you’re trying to honor. We spend a lot of our waking life at work. It’s nice to be recognized for the contributions we have made to the mission of our team. But an inauthentic reward can be worse than none. It leaves people feeling cynical because it suggests that their true contribution hasn’t really been noticed.",

        "description": "Warren Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.Paul Morigi/GettyWarren Buffett is being praised for paring Apple and stacking cash before the market slumped.Social media is full of Buffett quotes about market downturns, and memes featuring the investor.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold a net $134 billion of stocks in 2024 and built a record cash pile.Warren Buffett has sparked a raft of comments and memes on social media after the legendary investor sold most of his massive Apple stake and built a record cash pile before the stock market tumbled earlier this week.Warren Buffett really sold the Apple top and stashed up $300 billion in T-bills before the worst drawdown in several years at 94 years old, goat— Will (@WClementeIII) March 11, 2025 Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway nearly doubled its stockpile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets last year to $334 billion (or $321 billion if you subtract payables for T-bill purchases).Buffett sitting on $320 billion in cash: pic.twitter.com/MtTQhhugxL— Sleepwell (@SleepwellCap) March 11, 2025 The conglomerate's cash hoard ballooned largely because it sold a net $134 billion of stocks in 2024, and spent less than $3 billion on buybacks, halting them entirely in the second half. For comparison, it sold a net $24 billion of stocks and repurchased more than $9 billion worth of Berkshire stock in 2023.Sell, sell, sellBerkshire owned about 906 million shares of Apple worth $174 billion at the start of 2024, meaning the iPhone maker accounted for 49% of the total value of its stock portfolio. Over the next nine months, it cut its top holding by 67% to 300 million shares, worth $75 billion at the end of December.Buffett and his team also pared their number-two holding, Bank of America, by 34% to 680 million shares in the second half of 2024, cutting the position's value from $41 billion to just under $30 billion.As of Tuesday's close, Apple and Bank of America shares have dropped 15% and 20% each from their November highs. However, Apple is still up 15% since the start of 2024, meaning Buffett left money on the table by cashing out when he did. If he kept his stake intact throughout 2024 it would be worth nearly $200 billion.Bank of America is trading around the $40 mark, as it was at the end of June last year, meaning Buffett probably hasn't won or lost big from selling.There's nothing to say the market sell-off, which has pulled the S&P 500 down 9% and the Nasdaq Composite down 13% from their record closes on February 19, won't worsen as the Trump administration's policies continue to fuel recession fears.Warren Buffett watching the stock market collapse while holding $300 Billion in T-Bills pic.twitter.com/WLKRGjSCre— Not Jerome Powell (@alifarhat79) March 11, 2025 Moreover, it's important to consider where Buffett has invested the sale proceeds. Owning Treasurys is more lucrative than in the past; the 1-year yield has jumped from under 1% to over 4% in just over three years, primarily because rising inflation spurred the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to relieve upward pressure on prices.Buffett is also a long-term investor who's owned stocks such as Coca-Cola and American Express for decades. It's unlikely he pared his portfolio because he saw trouble coming and wanted to cash out before the next market crash — and he probably won't care much about a few months of stock performance.He's publicly soured on banks and pointed to higher bond yields and the prospect of steeper taxes on capital gains as two reasons he was happy to take some Apple profits and buy Treasurys instead. He's also explained his growing cash pile reflects a dearth of bargains with both private and public companies trading at heady valuations.Buffett walking into the Omaha office with 300B in T-bills this am... pic.twitter.com/aNbTFE2Pwu— Ross Hendricks (@Ross__Hendricks) March 10, 2025 It's also worth noting that quarterly portfolio filings provide limited insight into an investor's strategy. They're only a snapshot of their holdings on a single day with a six-week lag, and they exclude shares sold short, foreign-listed stocks, private investments, and non-stock assets.Even if Buffett isn't selling stocks and stacking cash because he expects a market downturn, his bearish positioning could still make him a winner if this one continues.Not only will the strategy temper the impact on his stock portfolio, it means he'll have plenty of dry powder to deploy on cut-price businesses and discounted stocks, as he did during the financial crisis.Words to rememberBuffett's social media followers aren't only applauding the timing of his Apple sales and cash build. Likely in a bid to shore up market sentiment, they're lining up to quote his famous advice to \"be greedy when others are fearful.\" &&&Moreover, they're sharing the column he published in the depths of the financial crisis, in which he urged others to buy stocks on the cheap.We are down maybe 10% from all-time highs and accounts are bringing out Buffett’s “Buy American” essay.Imagine what a real bear market would do to these people.

        "description": "Apple has successfully blocked its opponents in India, Tinder-owner Match and a group of startups, from accessing its commercially sensitive information which was part of antitrust findings against the U.S. firm, a confidential order shows. An investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year found Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system to the detriment of app developers, users and other payment processors. Apple has denied wrongdoing and said it is a small player in India where phones using Google’s operating system are dominant. The investigation process has concluded but CCI’s senior members are yet to review the findings and pass a final ruling, which could force Apple to pay fines and even change its practices if the company is confirmed to have indulged in wrongdoing. Apple’s opposing parties in the case—Match and startup group Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF)—asked the CCI to allow access to certain confidential information which include developer payouts and details of total billings, but were redacted when investigation reports were shared with parties. Match argued Apple had been “claiming excessive and unwarranted redactions in its submissions” across the world “to hinder effective scrutiny of its practices”, but the CCI did not agree and ruled in favour of Apple, according to a 13-page confidential order issued on March 3 and seen by Reuters. The order noted Apple’s comments, saying “the very fact that Match is involved in similar antitrust proceedings” with the company elsewhere will cause Apple harm if its commercially sensitive information is provided to Match. “The Commission notes that disclosure of such redacted information at this stage to ADIF and Match is neither necessary nor expedient . . . and disclosure of the same could potentially cause harm to the interests of Apple and other third parties,” the CCI noted. The CCI, Apple, Match and ADIF did not respond to Reuters queries. The Indian case was first filed by a little-known, nonprofit group called “Together We Fight Society” which argued Apple’s in-app fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers. Apple’s iOS powered about 4% of 712 million smartphones in India as of 2024 end, with the rest using Google’s Android, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple’s smartphone base in the country has grown five times in the last five years. Apple can still oppose findings of the CCI investigation and watchdog’s senior members are expected to issue a final ruling in coming weeks. In 2022, the CCI imposed a $113 million fine on Google and said it must allow the use of third-party billing and stop forcing developers to use its in-app payment system that charges commission of 15%-30%. Google has denied wrongdoing. —Aditya Kalra, Reuters",

Apple on Tuesday patched a critical zero-day vulnerability in virtually all iPhones and iPad models it supports and said it may have been exploited in “an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” using older versions of iOS. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, resides in Webkit, the browser engine driving Safari and all other browsers developed for iPhones and iPads. Devices affected include the iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later. The vulnerability stems from a bug that wrote to out-of-bounds memory locations. Supplementary fix “Impact: Maliciously crafted web content may be able to break out of Web Content sandbox,” Apple wrote in a bare-bones advisory. “This is a supplementary fix for an attack that was blocked in iOS 17.2.

Intuit began rolling out Tap to Pay on iPhone capabilities for QuickBooks Online customers Tuesday (March 11), saying this lets small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) accept in-person contactless payments using only an iPhone. These capabilities will be made available in the coming weeks to customers in the U.S. who have added a QuickBooks Payments plan to their subscription, the company said in a Tuesday press release. “What makes Tap to Pay on iPhone unique for QuickBooks customers, is that it allows them to streamline their in-person payments and seamlessly connect them to their books and our end-to-end services, putting their full business finances all in one place,” David Hahn, senior vice president, QuickBooks Money Platform, said in the release. QuickBooks Payments customers need only an iPhone and the QuickBooks mobile or GoPayment iOS apps to accept in-person contactless payments anywhere, according to the release. There is no need for a separate card reader or point-of-sale (POS) hardware. Businesses can accept contactless credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and other digital wallets, the release said. Transactions completed with Tap to Pay on iPhone sync directly to the business’s QuickBooks Online account so that they can manage and reconcile these payments and keep their books up to date, per the release. Software point-of-sale (SoftPOS) solutions like Tap to Pay have benefits that make them attractive to not only on-the-go businesses but also brick-and-mortar ones, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and Discover Global Network collaboration, “How SoftPOS is Poised to Revolutionize Payments.” The report found that these solutions can solve traditional POS pain points by providing faster service and checkouts, minimal training time and cost, a wide range of payment methods, and a single source of real-time data that can aid data-driven decision-making. Nearly three-quarters of merchants expect SoftPOS solutions to replace traditional POS systems sometime in the future, per the report. Intuit enhanced QuickBooks in November by adding a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered financial assistant called Intuit Assist for QuickBooks. In March 2024, the company added a line of credit offering called QuickBooks Line of Credit that enables small businesses to access funding from $1,000 to $50,000 and tap into the funding when and how they need it.

        "description": "The only things missing from these Airs are some Pro-only bells and whistles. A year ago, we called the M3 version of the MacBook Air \"just about as good as laptops get.\" The \"as good as laptops get\" part was about the qualitative experience of using the laptop, which was (and is) good-enough-to-great at just about everything a general-purpose laptop needs to be able to do. The \"just about\" part was mainly about the cost because to be happy with it long-term, it was a good idea for just about everybody to spend an extra $200 upgrading it from 8GB to 16GB of RAM. Apple also kept the M2 version of the Air in the lineup to hit its $999 entry-level price point; the M3 cost $100 extra. Apple fixed the RAM problem last fall when it increased the minimum amount of RAM across the entire Mac lineup from 8GB to 16GB without increasing prices. Though Apple probably did it to help enable additional Apple Intelligence features down the line, nearly anything you do with your Mac will eventually benefit from extra memory, whether you're trying to use Photoshop or Logic Pro or even if you're just opening more than a couple of dozen browser tabs at once.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "M3 Ultra has benefits, but sometimes you're paying more for worse performance. Apple is giving its high-end Mac Studio desktops a refresh this month, their first spec bump in almost two years. Considered on the time scale of, say, new Mac Pro updates, two years is barely any time at all. But Apple often delivers big performance increases for its Pro, Max, and Ultra chips from generation to generation, so any update—particularly one where you leapfrog two generations in a single refresh—can bring a major increase to performance that's worth waiting for. It's the magnitude of Apple's generation-over-generation updates that makes this Studio refresh feel odd, though. The lower-end Studio gets an M4 Max processor like you'd expect—the same chip Apple sells in its high-end MacBook Pros but fit into a desktop enclosure instead of a laptop. But the top-end Studio gets an M3 Ultra instead of an M4 Ultra. That's still a huge increase in CPU and GPU cores (and there are other Ultra-specific benefits, too), but it makes the expensive Studio feel like less of a step up over the regular one. How do these chips stack up to each other, and how big a deal is the lack of an M4 Ultra? How much does the Studio overlap with the refreshed M4 Pro Mac mini from last fall? And how do Apple's fastest chips compare to what Intel and AMD are doing in high-end PCs?Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Alphabet may have hoped that Donald Trump winning the White House would quell talk of a Google breakup, but that doesn’t seem likely. In a filing late last week, the Justice Department reiterated its suggestion that Google be forced to sell the Chrome web browser following a verdict last August that determined the company to be an illegal monopoly. That’s a setback for Google, and it could signal trouble ahead for other companies, as the government continues to take an aggressive stance on Big Tech. In some cases, that could be financial trouble. Google pays handsomely to be the default search engine for Safari, Apple’s Web browser. In 2022, Google’s revenue share payment to Apple was estimated at $20 billion. That worked out to 17.5% of the company’s operating profit that year. With that sort of money at risk, Apple asked to intervene as a defendant in the government’s case against Google last year, saying it didn’t want to lose “the ability to defend its right to reach other arrangements with Google that could benefit millions of users and Apple’s entitlement to compensation for distributing Google search to its users.” (Last month a judge denied that request.) Last week, however, the DOJ did agree to let Google pay Apple for services that were unrelated to search. The ripple effect could go well beyond finances. While Google was the only Big Tech company with a judgment against it, the Federal Trade Commission had expressed grievances against several other companies during the Biden administration. And the fact that the DOJ is not standing down on Google has executives worrying they might be next. Meta, for instance, is set to go on trial next month in a case that could see it forced to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. That case, originally filed by the FTC in 2020, alleges Meta overpaid for the two apps in an attempt to maintain a monopoly on personal social networks. Another judge set October 2026 as the start date for the FTC’s antitrust suit against Amazon. Apple is not immune from legal action either. The DOJ, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, sued the company last March for monopolizing the smartphone market. “This is . . . the first signal of the Trump Justice Department’s approach to antitrust litigation,” said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at AI-powered marketing solutions company SOCi. “The willingness of the Trump Justice Department to reinforce and continue prior actions against Big Tech has dangerous implications for Meta and Apple as well, given the cases they face in the next several months.” Federal officials are targeting each of these companies for something different, but there are some similar threads in the prosecutions. While Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta all operate in different parts of the technology world today, they share a common focus: artificial intelligence. “These are not firms anymore; they’re platforms,” says Ram Chellappa, professor of information systems and operations management at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. “As these platforms become bigger and their knowledge of the user increases and ownership of user data increases, they all . . . want to be the platform from which you do things. . . . Meta didn’t buy Instagram for the tech. They bought it [in 2012] for the user base, [and] their data. The future will boil down to who has the best training data for AI.” With the looming threat from the DOJ (as well as other threats made during the presidential campaign), the CEOs of major tech firms have been cozying up to Trump since he was elected. Google and Microsoft both donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. Meta did as well, and agreed to pay the president $25 million to settle a lawsuit for suspending his social accounts in 2021. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also contributed to the inauguration fund and has radically overhauled the opinion page of The Washington Post to reflect libertarian viewpoints and exclude opposing points of view (as well as killing a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris during the campaign). It’s unclear so far how effective those actions have been in shielding their companies from further scrutiny from the DOJ or FTC.",

The index sank by as much as 10 percent earlier in the session, which saw trading halted yet again. (Photo by Bryan R. Smith / AFP) (Photo by BRYAN R.

The […] The post Report: Apple to Make Biggest Changes to Operating Systems in Years appeared first on PYMNTS.com. Apple reportedly plans to make the operating systems of its devices simpler to navigate and more consistent across its iPhone, iPad and Mac. To accomplish this, the tech giant is planning its most significant upgrade to the Mac since 2020 and to the iPhone since 2013, Bloomberg reported Monday (March 10), citing unnamed sources. The update is expected to be delivered later this year as part of iOS 19, iPadOS 19 and macOS 16, according to the report. Apple did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Bloomberg report, the company’s revamp of its operating systems will include the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons; simpler ways to navigate and control the devices; and incorporate innovations introduced on visionOS, the operating system for its mixed-reality headset. The new operating systems could help Apple distract observers from the delays in its artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades for its Siri digital assistant and boost demand for its devices, which slowed after the pandemic and only gradually recovered, the report said. At the same time, the revamp could create a backlash among customers who use Apple devices to work, communicate and play, the report said. Apple took the next step in the rollout of its suite of AI capabilities, Apple Intelligence, in January by turning it on by default in a software update for iPhones, iPads and Macs. Before that, users with iPhones that support Apple Intelligence were prompted to activate it when setting up their phone, a process that involved having to download software. In February, Apple said that it plans to add those AI capabilities to another platform — its mixed-reality headset, Vision Pro — in April. Apple Intelligence will be available in beta in a software update, visionOS 2.4, with support for U.S. English, before expanding to include support for other languages throughout the year. On Friday (March 7), Apple reportedly told Reuters that some AI improvements to Siri will be delayed until 2026. The company had previously said that Siri would see these enhancements this year. It did not give a reason for the delay. The post Report: Apple to Make Biggest Changes to Operating Systems in Years appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

After updating the iPad Pro and iPad mini in 2024, the company has just unveiled a third-generation iPad Air and an eleventh-generation iPad. Many fans of Apple’s tablets have been eagerly awaiting these updates, especially since before this week, the company’s entry-level iPad had not had a refresh since October of 2022. But if you’ve been waiting until this week’s reveals, hoping for a clear picture of Apple’s iPad offerings in order to select the one best for your needs, well, I’ve got bad news: the iPad lineup remains as confusing as ever. Here’s why. Not all models support Apple Intelligence Apple makes four different types of iPads: the iPad Pro, the iPad Air, the iPad, and the iPad mini. Yet despite each model getting an update within the last year—one of them still lacks the hardware to run Apple’s much-hyped Apple Intelligence AI platform, which debuted in October 2024. That would be the new iPad—yes, the eleventh-generation tablet that Apple announced just this week. In 2025. In a baffling move, Apple decided to equip the new iPad with just 6GB of memory and the A16 chip—the CPU Apple first introduced all the way back in 2022 in the iPhone 14 Pro series and later included in the iPhone 15 series. None of these devices can run Apple Intelligence because the AI platform requires at least 8GB of memory. It’s shocking that Apple decided to limit its new 2025 iPad to just 6GB of memory and the A16 instead of giving it the more advanced A17 Pro chip and 8GB of memory that can run Apple Intelligence and that the smaller iPad mini, introduced in 2024, has packed inside. Why would Apple do this? I’ve reached out to the company for comment and have yet to hear back, but the most likely reason is that Apple wants to push customers into its higher-priced iPad models, like the iPad mini ($499) and iPad Air ($549), instead of having them buy the entry-level iPad ($349). Consumers are starting to go crazy for AI, and, in my opinion, Apple knows that by excluding Apple Intelligence from the entry-level iPad, many of them will instead opt to shell out another $150 to $200 more on an iPad that supports it. You can’t fault a company for wanting to make more money. But the lack of Apple Intelligence support on the new iPad is going to confuse a lot of people. Some may buy it thinking it comes with Apple Intelligence since, you know, every other iPad does. This device is kind of already obsolete—at least if you ever want to use Apple Intelligence. The thinnest and lightest model..is not the one you would think The lack of Apple Intelligence on Apple’s newest iPad isn’t the only thing likely to confuse consumers. Many people are drawn to tablets because they are thin and light and thus easier to lug around than a laptop. Historically, Apple’s thinnest and lightest devices have all fallen under a unique moniker: “Air.” There’s the MacBook Air—the thinnest laptop Apple sells. There’s the (very likely) upcoming iPhone Air, which will be the thinnest iPhone ever, and of course, there is the iPad Air, which is the thinnest…wait, no. You would think the iPad Air would be the thinnest iPad Apple makes, but that’s not true. If you want the thinnest iPad, you actually need to buy the iPad Pro (which is 5.1 mm or 5.3 mm thin, depending on screen size) and not the iPad Air (which is 6.1 mm thin). But what if you want the lightest iPad? Surely, that’s the iPad Air, right? No. That’s the 11-inch iPad Pro, which weighs in at 0.98 pounds. The 11-inch iPad Air is 1.01 pounds (and if you think it’s fair to compare apples to oranges, the iPad mini with its 8.3-inch screen comes in at just 0.65 pounds, beating the iPad Air by a long shot). Do you see how confusing this could be to the average consumer? And don’t even get me started on Apple Pencil compatibility (the Apple Pencil Pro works with the smaller iPad mini from 2024, but not the larger, newer iPad Apple introduced this week). Which iPad should you get? I’ve long hoped that Apple would fix its confusing iPad lineup. They didn’t do it last year, or the year before, and with the new iPads this week, it looks like they aren’t going to do it in 2025 either. So, if you are in the market for a new iPad, maybe this little cheat sheet will help you out: If you want the thinnest iPad, get an iPad Pro (not the iPad Air). If you want the lightest iPad, get the iPad mini. If you want to be able to use the Apple Pencil Pro, get the iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini. If you want Apple Intelligence, get the iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini—and avoid the new iPad. And if you want a lack of confusion…I guess maybe wait to see if the 2026 iPad family finally brings much-needed simplicity to Apple’s tablet lineup? The new 2025 iPad and iPad Air are now available to pre-order and will be released on March 12.",

In 2011, Apple debuted Siri, the world’s first digital assistant embedded in a smartphone. It was revolutionary in its functionality and technology. For the first time, users could talk to their smartphone, and Siri was built using machine learning, which was state of the art at the time, Luc Julia, a co-designer of the original Siri and now chief scientific officer of French automaker Renault, told PYMNTS in an interview. Then, in 2014, Amazon launched its own digital assistant, Alexa. It was an improvement upon Siri because it used deep learning. Apple waited three years before matching Amazon’s use of deep learning. That’s classic Apple, and the same dynamics are at play in the company’s adoption of generative artificial intelligence, Julia said. “They took their time, and it is happening the same way today” with generative AI nearly 3 years old now, Julia said. OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out in November 2022. Apple told Reuters Friday (March 7) that some AI improvements to Siri will be delayed until 2026. Previously, it had said Siri would see enhancements this year. Apple did not give a reason for the delay. The news came a week after Amazon announced Alexa+, which embeds generative and agentic AI. Read also: Apple Reportedly Battling Bugs Holding Back Long-Awaited Siri Upgrade Siri Is Falling Behind Rivals Apple must move faster because consumers are starting to notice that its AI is lagging behind more able competitors in the market, such as ChatGPT, the new Alexa, Google Gemini and others, Julia said. “I would try to push [an advanced conversational AI version] as soon as possible,” especially since generative AI is developing “very fast,” he said. While Apple has a partnership with OpenAI to use the startup’s AI models for its iOS devices, advanced functionalities are not yet being seen in Siri, Julia said. “People are realizing more and more that they are not at the front end of the technology,” he said. Even Apple Intelligence, which is the name for the company’s AI features embedded in high-end or new Apple products, has gotten a lukewarm reaction. There were reports of it hallucinating in news summaries. Julia said he’s tried Apple Intelligence and “it’s not really astonishing.” See also: Apple Intelligence to Expand to Vision Pro Headset in April A Perfectionist Culture One hurdle to moving faster is Apple’s culture, as a product must be “nearly perfect” before it is introduced, Julia said. Co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs famously sent circuit boards back to engineers because the chips inside weren’t aligned even though the user wouldn’t see it, for example. With generative AI, it is “difficult to control totally,” Julia said. AI chatbots can say toxic things and be jailbroken, meaning hacked into doing something they have been trained not to do. “It’s always possible for humans to trick AI,” Julia said. “Apple doesn’t want that. They want to control everything. They want to be sure that it is going to be clean and creative, which is pretty much impossible with Gen AI.” Julia said Apple wouldn’t want to repeat the experience of Apple Maps, which was widely panned when it was launched in 2012 for missteps, such as mislabeling locations and giving wrong directions. Apple CEO Tim Cook later apologized to users for the missteps. “They are falling behind because of this fear of not being perfect,” Julia said. Apple did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Read also: Report: Apple Moves Project Manager Kim Vorrath to AI Division Steve Jobs Alone Wanted Siri Siri was created by nonprofit research and development group SRI International, where Julia was a director, and spun off as a separate company in 2007. Apple acquired Siri in April 2010 and integrated it into the iPhone 4S in 2011. Julia, who later joined Apple as a director, said top Apple executives back then were against the idea of a voice assistant like Siri. “Only one guy wanted it,” he said. “It was Steve Jobs.” So, everyone fell in line. Jobs “saw the potential of talking to a phone,” Julia said. “He was a visionary.” Julia said he sees the same cautiousness now among Apple’s top management about revamping Siri. “It’s the same story we are talking about today, which is, don’t go too fast,” he said. “We’ll see if we want to do it.” Getting new technology fast is something today’s consumers like. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “How Consumers Want to Live in the Voice Economy” found that consumers’ interest in using voice-activated technologies as they try to multitask during their busy daily lives is growing. Since Jobs died in 2011, innovation has been fairly light at Apple, Julia said, adding the most innovative thing Apple has done since then is the Apple Vision Pro, its automated reality headset. Julia offered this advice to Cook: “I would tell him that he needs to do some kind of minimum viable product … in conversational AI, just to show that they are in the race.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "IFC Films, AppleTV+, Warner Bros. Pictures Sunset Boulevard_Corbis/Getty, BIWhen people ask Patricia Arquette to explain what's happening in the latest tantalizingly twisty episode of \"Severance,\" her reply is as cold as her onscreen counterpart, Harmony Cobel.\"Too bad,\" Arquette texted a friend who'd asked her for answers. Then she posted a screenshot of the exchange on Instagram and included the hashtag \"#ToughLuck.\"If Arquette delights in keeping Lumon's company secrets from her friends, it's because, at one point, she was equally in the dark. Embodying a mysterious middle manager on the hit Apple TV+ series centered on an equally mysterious company was a challenge, particularly in season one, when information about her character was doled out slowly and deliberately, even to the cast.\"It's like, 'OK, you're going to have those questions and tough shit,' which is really different than formulaic TV,\" Arquette told Business Insider.With almost four decades of acting experience under her belt, the 56-year-old has played nearly every kind of role on nearly every kind of project. She's been the ingenue in a movie written by Quentin Tarantino (\"True Romance\"), the enigmatic muse of the famously inscrutable David Lynch (\"Lost Highway\") and won an Oscar for playing the long game with Richard Linklater's \"Boyhood,\" which she filmed over a span of 12 years.Still, developing an emotional throughline for the guarded Harmony Cobel in \"Severance,\" now airing its second season, was a task as puzzling as Lumon's maze-like office building.\"As an actor, you want to know, 'What am I playing? Where am I going? What's going on?' You want to make choices that make sense,\" Arquette said.Arquette as Harmony Cobel in season two of \"Severance.\"Apple TV+Still, she and Harmony are both getting comfortable with questions being left unanswered.\"I think we all want that in life, too,\" Arquette added. \"Lumon is like that. Lumon is any relationship that you have that's confusing and you don't know where you stand.\"Arquette explores her career in the latest installment of BI's Role Play series — from getting advice from a row of famous directors to lusting after Peter Dinklage.On feeling safe filming sex scenes and advocating for equal pay in HollywoodArquette in \"Lost Highway.\"Getty ImagesThe start of your career kicked off pretty quickly with an amazing run of classic '90s movies like \"True Romance,\" \"Lost Highway,\" \"Ed Wood,\" and \"Flirting with Disaster.\" How were you choosing roles and envisioning your career at the time?I just wanted to work with great artists, great artists like David Lynch, and I wanted to challenge myself and try to go to new territory.That was scary for me. I mean, I've always been very, very modest about nudity and sex and all of that. And so to do a movie [like \"Lost Highway,\"] where that really challenged that within myself was interesting.You were also pretty young in \"True Romance,\" where you play a sex worker. How did you feel about the nudity and performing your sexuality for that role?It was really hard for me because it isn't my nature, but I do understand that sexuality plays an important, powerful position in people's lives: in their expression of love, their expression of desire, their pursuit of power, or their desire to control someone. I mean, there's a lot of places that sexuality, I think, is pivotal.Arquette in \"True Romance.\"Warner Bros. Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty ImagesThere are also more conversations these days about having intimacy coordinators on set. Have you noticed differences over time in the way directors have approached sex scenes with you?Well, I haven't really had to do a lot of sex scenes for a long time. But I have a bathtub scene coming up in a project I'm about to do, and so they were like, \"Do you want an intimacy coordinator?\" And usually I would say no, but for this, even though I trust everyone, I just feel very vulnerable at this moment in my life. I feel like, yeah, I do want that. I'm really glad that they have intimacy coordinators now.At a certain point, I felt like I would have to step in myself. I remember \"The Act,\" there was a bath sequence with Joey King, and I was like, \"Hey, no monitors. Turn the camera away. Who's going to be on the set? What do we have to cover her?\" Hopefully, senior people do that kind of stuff anyway for people, but I don't think it's a bad thing to have an intimacy coordinator because there's a lot of people that are out of line, and it might not even be the director or the actor. Sometimes it's the crew. Why put a young person — or even not a young person, anyone — in that position? God knows a lot of people have been through enough.Were there times on set when you were younger that you had to advocate for yourself in those types of scenes?Oh, yeah. I remember there was a scene in \"Lost Highway\" at the end where I'm naked, and Balthazar Getty and I are having this love scene outside this cabin, and then it's going to burn down. And everyone kept saying, \"OK, closed set. There's going to be nudity,\" blah, blah, blah. \"Walk away if we don't need you in this part.\"They kept saying that, and there was still a lot of people on the set. And so I had a robe on, and I was like, \"OK, guys, I just want to say something. I'm about to take this robe off, and when I take this robe off, if I turn around and I see you there, and I know you don't need to be here, I'm going to walk over and punch you in the fucking face.\" [Laughs] And then 15 people ran away.People are jerks. That's all I could say.Speaking of advocating for yourself, you used your best supporting actress speech at the 2015 Oscars to discuss equal rights and equal pay for women. Was getting your due something that was a challenge early in your career, or even to this day?Well, I wasn't talking about myself when I gave that speech. I mean, yes, I was aware that there was a difference in Hollywood, but I was also a producer at that time on a movie called \"Equal Means Equal,\" and I was very well aware that it was happening in like 98% of all industries. It was really impacting women of color. It was like a double punch in the face. It was terrible. Between the racism and the sexism, they were really economically being brutalized.So, I wasn't really talking so much about Hollywood at the time, but have I experienced that? Yeah, for sure. I mean, the common language the whole time that I was growing up or getting parts was, \"They've already paid the guy. They don't really have any money.\"It all went to the guy. That was a very common thing that you used to hear. But I do think at a certain point, they started realizing that wasn't cool and that wasn't going to fly.On getting advice from Martin Scorsese and playing real-life criminalsArquette as Joyce Mitchell in \"Escape at Dannemora.\"ShowtimeYou've worked with auteurs like David Lynch, David O. Russell, Tim Burton, and Martin Scorsese. What's a piece of advice one of them gave you that you've never forgotten?Each of them were really amazing and they each gave you different kinds of advice. I remember Martin Scorsese at one point, we were doing this shot on [\"Bringing Out the Dead\"] and his monitor went out, and so we did this take and he was like, \"Great, cut. We got it. We can move on.\"And I was like, \"How can you say that?\" He couldn't even see it! He's like, \"No, but you can hear it. Sometimes when I'm editing, I'll turn away, and I'll edit by sound, the performance.\" It's like, \"Oh, wait. I need to cut three more frames out of that.\" He's right. When you're really in it, the sound is right. The space between the sounds is right.Before the pandemic, you had two acclaimed projects in which you played controversial real-life women: Dee Dee Blanchard in \"The Act\" and Joyce Mitchell in \"Escape at Dannemora.\" In both cases, subjects of these series later expressed displeasure with their depictions. Do those kinds of reactions change how you would approach \"true story\" roles in the future?I mean, look, I don't think any of these people would like anything to be made of them and I don't blame them.It's not a nice story about them. You know what I mean? They're not coming out looking great in the story itself, and sometimes, there's very little material to really build on them.On doing network TV while shooting 'Boyhood' and her most politically incorrect filmArquette in \"Boyhood.\"UniversalIn the 2000s, you starred on \"Medium\" for six years. What made you want to jump from movies to network TV?Well, it was a time where I was moving out of the ingenue age group and I was moving more into the wife group. And honestly, the parts were just really boring in movies. It was like, \"Hi honey, how are you? I'll see you after court.\"There was a shift in movies at that time, away from more artistic movies to mega-tentpole movies. It just seemed like there was more interesting material on TV, and I liked the challenge of trying to do good work on TV. There was something challenging the status quo about it.Before prestige TV and streaming, I would imagine doing network TV wasn't considered as respected. Did you get judgment from people?Oh, yeah. Snotty people would say to me, \"What? You're doing TV? Oh my God, you used to make movies!\"Meanwhile, for a large part of that, I was working on \"Boyhood,\" and I'd say, \"Yeah, I'm still making movies. You'll see.\"Yeah, you'll see in 12 years when this comes out.When you're on TV, it's really hard to jump out of that character into another character. But it was really nice to also go play with a whole different kind of story and a different kind of camera work and different world.The process of \"Boyhood\" was so slow, and it wasn't about that race to the finish line. There were so many strange things about \"Boyhood\" that were beautiful. People that started at the beginning as a PA, by the end, they were running first teams, and they were first AD. But they'd still come back as a PA for us.Arquette wit",

        "description": "Brazil is making it clear to Apple that it needs the tech giant to follow the right anti-trust measures for it to work effectively in the country. This is why the Cupertino firm was given a 90-day deadline to enable sideloading on iOS devices. The news comes after the EU made the iPhone maker implement serious changes to how the App Store can work for users in the region. As shared by the Brazilian media outlet called Valor Economico, the country’s federal judge issued a statement on this matter yesterday. They want Apple to open up the entire iOS ecosystem for third-party applications in the country, similar to how it’s functioning across the European Union. The judge shared how the limitations imposed by the firm on different developers might jeopardize the arrival of new competition in this domain. In November of 2024, we saw another local antitrust regulator in the country rule that Apple could not stop developers from selling material and distributing apps outside the App Store. The company has just a 20-day deadline to comply with the rules, or else it would get a fine of more than $40K a day. It’s not shocking that Apple chose to appeal the ruling as that gave the tech giant more time to discuss this case. During that moment, Apple shared that such requests to roll out changes at the App Store were not urgent and how it would negatively impact the company’s business model. Meanwhile, in February this year, Apple also had to witness a public hearing in the country regarding the case.For now, Judge Pablo Zuniga wants Apple to implement the outlined changes by three months. He says that despite what the company has to say, they’ve already complied in other countries in the same way. Therefore, there should be no reason why it cannot do the same in Brazil.The entire scrutiny against the iPhone maker started after Latin American-based e-commerce firm Mercado Libre blasted the company for making developers provide digital products in apps to their respective apps to utilize Apple’s customized payment means. Other firms like Match, which also has Tinder and Epic Games under its belt, were seen filing a similar complaint against the firm with the regulator from Brazil.Meanwhile, one spokesperson from Apple explained to the Brazilian media outlet that it only believes in celebrating competition and vibrancy in the market. It is facing competition with different companies wherever it functions. So it’s always reinforcing the commitment it has to users. Moreover, Apple mentioned how such changes will affect the privacy and security of users with iOS devices, so it will be rolling out another appeal against the decision.Sideloading on iOS is a controversial subject for Apple, and it makes sense why Brazil wants the company to work like how it is now in the EU.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: • Terrorism Affects 68 Countries in 2024, With Sahel and Pakistan Among the Hardest Hit• Top Apps Can't Afford to Ignore Apple Search Ads, Here’s Why",

        "description": "The iPhone 16e rethinks—and prices up—the basic iPhone. For a long time, the cheapest iPhones were basically just iPhones that were older than the current flagship, but last week’s release of the $600 iPhone 16e marks a big change in how Apple is approaching its lineup. Rather than a repackaging of an old iPhone, the 16e is the latest main iPhone—that is, the iPhone 16—with a bunch of stuff stripped away. There are several potential advantages to this change. In theory, it allows Apple to support its lower-end offerings for longer with software updates, and it gives entry-level buyers access to more current technologies and features. It also simplifies the marketplace of accessories and the like.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Many app makers are using Apple Search ads as an ad platform, and many of the professional as well as newer developers are using huge sums of money on ads on the App Store because it gives them good results. So this is making many marketers wonder whether using Apple Search Ads is important or not, if they want to compete in the App Store? The answer is that it isn't that important to use Apple Search Ads, but if you are not using it, you may be at a disadvantage. Appfigures analyzed 100 top apps on the App Store in the US to see which apps are using Apple Search ads and which apps are not using it. Last time when Appfigures analyzed this, it was found that non-gaming apps (including TikTok, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Photos, NordVPN) use Apple Search ads more than gaming apps. But the situation has changed now because 80 of the top apps and games on the App Store are using Apple Search ads. This means that both gaming and non-gaming apps are using Apple Search Ads and most of them have used it for 30 or less days. Many games like \"Last War: Survival\", Royal Match, Monopoly Go, Pokemon Go, and Candy Crush, and almost all games in the top 100 highest grossing apps are using Apple Search ads, which shows how relevant ASA has become. The apps that are not using Apple Search ads are the ones that are spending more on their branding somewhere else, like Hulu, YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, and Disney+.Read next: Google’s Secret to Staying on Top – 86.94% of Americans Still Use It Daily!",

        "description": "As an app designed to facilitate gay hookups, popular site Sniffies has had a limitation since it started in 2018—it was only accessible via web browser. Until Monday, when the map-based cruising site debuted its Apple-approved iOS app. Building an app that complies with Apple’s notoriously stringent content moderation—and total ban on apps that directly serve adult content—was a challenge for Sniffies, which wears its sexuality proudly. Its users, which it calls “cruisers,” do, too. Many users put nude images as their cover photos, meaning adult content is visible from the second the platform is opened in a browser. The company needed to tame the experience for Apple to get on board, without losing what most users come to Sniffies for: sex. “We needed to be very strategic about this, to get around Apple’s strict not safe for work content policies, but also keep the magic of Sniffies,” says Eli Martin, Sniffies’ chief marketing officer. “The key was giving cruisers control of the experience.” How Sniffies met Apple’s content safety standards Sniffies leadership weren’t begging to get on the App Store. Its web app format worked well, particularly for the men who aren’t out or are exploring their sexuality, who Martin says make up a core—and growing—part of its user base. But fans wanted a native app, and it was difficult to compete with the market’s heavyweights like Grindr without the App Store’s discovery tools. When they finally decided to make the move, the Sniffies team looked to bigger apps like Reddit and X, both of which host explicit content, as models. Similar to those sites’ apps, when you download the new Sniffies app, it is in “Vanilla mode” (internally, the company calls this “deep safe”). Anything explicit is blurred; to unblur the photos, users must follow a link to the browser version, where they can change their settings. Then, the app will respond to the changed settings and allow users to see graphic content. [Photo: Sniffies] “There was certainly back-and-forth with the App Store and figuring out how to make it work on both ends,” Martin says, estimating the process lasted about a year and a half. “It took way longer than we thought, but it seems like Apple was very open to us being a part of the store as long as we could meet the guidelines.” They had to make some concessions. Sniffies’ anonymous log-in function, which allowed users to enter with only a birthdate, won’t be accessible through the iOS app.(This anonymous log-in feature has left the door open to the abuse of minors, per The Information.) There’s a “friction” to the process of creating an account that will be necessary in the App Store, Martin says; users can’t just download and see the map. But there are also benefits: Some users report the map being faster, and the app’s notification system is now more robust than it was just with the web version. Preserving the cruising spirit While the company doesn’t yet know which audiences will gravitate towards which mediums, Martin has his suspicions. Those “DL and curious” guys, as he describes them, will likely stay on the webapp, not wanting to download something to their phone. (This is a problem with Grindr, he points out: Users download and delete the app, over and over.) But the iOS launch opens them up to a new audience: the users that were never going to navigate to the Sniffies link. This audience was loud. Martin recounts years of comments across the Sniffies social media, begging them to get in the App Store. His team is now going through each and every one of these comments, telling them to download. App users are also privvy to the larger brand world that Sniffies has built around its main offering. The company has invested deeply in its (often explicit) marketing, which spans an apparel shop, its Hush lifestyle blog, and its Cruising Confessions podcast. The company has also sponsors in-person events and parties, echoing the pushes from other dating apps. Even in the app store, Sniffies proclaims that it is “for cruisers, by cruisers.” Martin points out that the company’s marketing strategy is based on “foreplay,” teasing the app’s sexuality without being completely blatant with it. They can do that in the app store, too. But does Martin see access to a mainstream audience as a threat to the more clandestine nature of the web app that made Sniffies unique? “I personally am not too worried about that,” Martin says. “We’ve only seen better results for cruisers the larger we’ve gotten. The important thing is the culture. We’ve already set the groundwork.”",

        "description": "In our testing, Apple's iPhone 16 is the best phone for seniors. See how it compares to options specially designed for older adults or basic uses. When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreIn our testing, Apple's iPhone 16 is the best phone for seniors. See how it compares to options specially designed for older adults or basic uses.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderMany older adults can enjoy the same phones as anyone else, and as such, the best phone for seniors in our testing is Apple's iPhone 16, the model that tops our guide to the best phones overall.To be sure, some older adults aren't interested in or comfortable with high-end phones with the latest tech and features. Still, they might appreciate a smartphone for sharing photos and video calling with friends and family. For those people, we recommend the Lively Jitterbug Smart4, which features a straightforward interface and customer support specialized for older adults.And for those who prefer to stick to phone calls and want a simple mobile phone experience, the Snapfon ez4G with a candy bar design is our preferred option.Our top picks for the best phones for seniorsBest overall: Apple iPhone 16 - See at Best BuyBest specially designed: Lively Jitterbug Smart4 - See at AmazonBest simple phone: Snapfon ez4G - See at AmazonBest overallWe recommend the iPhone 16 to older adults for the same reasons we list it as the best phone overall for most people and the top model in our best iPhone guide. It's powerful, comes with excellent cameras, the iOS operating system is intuitive, has great battery life, and includes the popular Messages and Facetime apps for seamless communication with friends and family who also own iPhones.Some older adults may not need the performance and more advanced features offered in the iPhone 16, like Apple Intelligence. However, the iPhone 16 and the iOS operating system are equally effective as a straightforward phone for basic usage and as an advanced device, and we don't want to limit what's available just because someone is older.Plus, plenty of performance headroom means you won't need to buy a new phone anytime soon. It'll likely run quickly and smoothly until Apple drops software support in six or more years.The iPhone 16's iOS operating system can also be modified to display larger fonts and icons, and the home screen can be arranged so that only the most important or relevant apps to a senior's experience are visible and usable.The iPhone 16 (left) and iPhone 16 Plus (right) are the best phones for older adults thanks to their intuitive operating system and ecosystem, including accessories and physical retail locations for support.Antonio Villas-Boas/Business InsiderApple's physical retail presence also offers a significant advantage over Android phones. It allows many older adults, especially those who aren't tech-savvy, to get support for their devices easily. Indeed, they can physically go to an Apple Store and ask for help or repairs, which we think is valuable if a tech-savvy family member or friend isn't immediately nearby. Getting physical help can also be less stressful and confusing than getting support over the phone.By comparison, there are few official retail locations for Android phones, and much of the support relies on phone-based customer service. Authorized third-party physical locations exist for Android devices, but when making a broad recommendation, we prefer Apple's physical presence in terms of reliability and likelihood of getting a good experience.If you need an iPhone with a larger screen for better visibility, the iPhone 16 Plus comes just as recommended as the iPhone 16. They're effectively the same phone, with the only difference being the larger screen size and extended battery life on the iPhone 16 Plus.The iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 series, including the larger Plus models, are also available for lower price points than the iPhone 16 and offer a largely similar experience with slightly less performance longevity.Read our full iPhone 16 review, and see our guide to the best iPhone 16 cases to protect the phone.Best specially designedFor older adults who are not tech-oriented and don't have access to a nearby Apple location for support (or can't easily travel to one), Lively's Jitterbug Smart4, with its included cellular and support plans, is an ideal option. To clarify, the Jitterbug Smart4 can only be bought with a phone plan from Lively, which provides cellular connectivity (on Verizon's wide-reaching network) and support. In other words, you can't buy the phone unlocked or use it on any other carrier's phone plan.While that might seem limiting, it's the phone-based customer service tailored for older adults that makes Lively such a great option. Lively customers can easily call a support agent to get help with their phone, look up a number, or get directions. You can also get physical help with the device and service at Best Buy retail locations.The Jitterbug Smart4 runs on a senior-optimized version of the Android operating system with a straightforward smartphone interface.Lively / Business InsiderThe Basic plan for $20/month includes the \"Ask Lively\" customer support feature outlined above and a \"Lively Rides\" feature in partnership with Lyft to get help scheduling a ride. You can opt for the Preferred plan for $40/month, which includes \"Urgent Response\" service for emergencies and \"Lively Link\" to alert family members about the emergency. The $50/month Premium plan adds the \"Care Advocate\" feature for getting help with meeting health and well-being goals and \"Nurse On-Call\" to get medical advice from nurses and doctors around the clock.The Jitterbug Smart4 phone has a large 6.7-inch display for high visibility, and its operating system is less cluttered than the mainstream versions of Android or even Apple's iOS. It runs on a version of Android customized for older adults for clear visibility and ease of use, and it can run any app available in the Google Play Store.The smaller Jitterbug Flip2 flip phone from Lively has the same support features as the Jitterbug Smart4. It's an excellent option for those who prefer to use phones for basic calling and texting. However, if you think the motion of flipping a flip phone closed or open could cause problems, you may want to consider the Snapfon ez4G below.Best simple phone (non-smartphone)For those who use phones primarily or exclusively for calling, we recommend phones with the simple candy bar design, which features tactile buttons and a screen on the front of a relatively compact, rectangular phone. Flip phone designs are fine, but flipping open the phone could be an unnecessary obstacle for some older adults.The Snapfon ez4G is as user-friendly as it gets with its large tactile buttons and a decently sized 2.3-inch display relative to its candy bar design. Unlike the candy bar phones from the early 2000s, the Snapfon ez4G isn't trying to be as small as possible, but it's also not huge at 5.6 inches in height. It's smaller overall than the iPhone 16 and easy to handle.One of the best things about candy bar phones is their battery life. The Snapfon ez4G touts four and a half days of standby battery life and five hours of talk time for calls. It's charged with a USB-C cable, and a charging dock is optionally available.The Snapfon ez4G's large buttons and One-Touch SOS button for emergency services make it an ideal option for seniors relative to other basic phones.Snapfon / Business InsiderLike Lively, a Snapfon phone plan is required to use the Snapfon ez4G. For phone calls and messaging, you'll only need the base $15/month Talk and Text plus 1GB plan, which comes with unlimited talk and text. Snapfon plans use T-Mobile's network for coverage.We like the Snapfon ez4G over numerous other candy bar phones designed for seniors due to its red One-Touch SOS Button on the rear. Pressing it activates the optional One-Touch SOS service, which lets you quickly contact emergency services and emergency contacts and get answers to medical questions. That said, $40/month for the service is steep compared to Lively's offering, but at least it's an option that most candy bar phones don't include.Customer support is also trained specifically for seniors and based in the US. However, Snapfon doesn't have physical locations.How we test phones for seniorsWe've exhaustively tested every iPhone and nearly every Android phone available in the US for general day-to-day use and through standardized assessments.Our phone testing procedure includes assessing overall performance, battery life, and camera quality, making phone and video calls, sending messages, and using various apps. For older adults, we've added extra consideration for ease of use of the phone itself and its operating system, the number and quality of apps available, and the potential to obtain support.For phones we haven't tested in-house, we've extensively researched available phones and picked the best options based on experience with brands, software, and ecosystems broadly, while also considering user reviews and assessments from reputable publishers at scale.For both tested and untested phones, we also take into account more than 20 years of experience with how the older adults in our own lives interact with their mobile devices to communicate.What to look for in phones for seniorsWhen considering phones for seniors, the first aspect to assess is an older adult's degree of comfort with modern technology — namely touchscreens and apps (especially apps that aren't directly related to functions like making calls). For almost any tech comfort level, the iPhone 16 is a great option thanks to its intuitive interface and versatility.You should also gauge whether you or the older adult you are thinking of would benefit from extra help with their device, with customer support specially tailored for older adults who aren't necessarily familiar with",

        "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook faces some tough decisions, analysts said.Justin Sullivan/GettyApple faces challenges from President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.A US 20% tariff on goods from China threatens Apple's vast supply chain in the country.The iPhone maker is likely weighing its options to avoid cost impact, analysts said.Apple managed to avoid some tariffs on goods from China during President Donald Trump's first term. This time around, it's unclear if Apple CEO Tim Cook can get the same carveouts — despite promising investment in US manufacturing and jobs.Apple is facing a potential financial hit from Trump's tariffs on goods from foreign countries, including China. Trump doubled the tariff on goods from China from 10% to 20%, on top of existing levies, and slapped a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, beginning Tuesday.Apple, which has a large supply chain network in China, will have to navigate the effects of Trump's executive order. Morningstar estimates that 70% of iPhones are manufactured in China, while S&P Global said it's about 90% in 2025.The order could also weigh on sales of products in Greater China itself, which represented 17% of revenue last year.If the tariffs remain as they are, analysts expect Apple to make adjustments to offset the potential financial impact. However, Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said the company's plans will \"likely be in flux for some time.\"He added, \"Apple is sorting this all out now.\"Consumers can \"expect mixed signals,\" said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI's sister company, EMARKETER.Here are the options that Chatterjee and other analysts who follow Apple say the tech behemoth is considering.Avoid the tariffs altogetherCook successfully secured exemptions from the 10% tariff on goods from China during Trump's previous term, and analysts haven't counted him out this time.Apple has already said it'll add to its US footprint, including pledging a multibillion-dollar investment toward its projects and saying it plans to hire 20,000 people over the next four years. It's partly an attempt to gain exemptions for Apple during this term, Bourne said.\"We're optimistic that Apple's $500 billion investment announcement will help the firm gain an exemption from the tariffs underway,\" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said.If not, it'll have to examine other options.Bump up the price of iPhonesIt's too soon to know Apple's \"mitigation strategies\" for certain, but increasing the price of consumer goods likely isn't off the table, Chatterjee told BI.Apple launched a new iPad Air with Apple Intelligence capabilities on the same day the tariffs went into effect. The tablets come with an M3 chip and start at $599 — the same price as its predecessor from 2024.\"I wouldn't expect a knee-jerk reaction from Apple, which is why the iPad Air M3 pricing remains unchanged,\" Chatterjee said.The iPhone will be where Apple will make its \"toughest decisions,\" Bourne said. IPhone sales have stumbled in Greater China, and China's government announced plans for retaliatory tariffs on Tuesday, which could hurt them more.IPhone prices in the US haven't risen since 2020 outside of its Pro Max model going from $1099 to $1199 when the Apple Intelligence-powered iPhone 15 came out, Kerwin said. If gradual price hikes occur, analysts said Apple's best-performing regions and products, like the iPhone, will get a price bump first.Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.Shift its supply chain out of ChinaBy shifting production to \"less tariff disadvantaged locations,\" Apple would avoid absorbing the cost or placing it on consumers.It's easier said than done. Apple has fostered deep relationships with Chinese manufacturers over the years. Although it's had some victories in the attempted shift to other countries, it still relies on China for its incomparable scale of operations.For three years, Apple has shown signs that it's looking to move its supply chain away from China. The tech giant moved some of its iPhone production to India in 2022. In December, Bloomberg reported its plans to begin producing AirPods in India.However, some experts have said trying to avoid tariffs this time around would be harder, BI previously reported. Trump could target more countries than he did in his first term, and places where businesses shifted their operations to avoid tariffs might not be spared, experts told BI in February.Read the original article on Business Insider Apple CEO Tim Cook faces some tough decisions, analysts said.Justin Sullivan/GettyApple faces challenges from President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.A US 20% tariff on goods from China threatens Apple's vast supply chain in the country.The iPhone maker is likely weighing its options to avoid cost impact, analysts said.Apple managed to avoid some tariffs on goods from China during President Donald Trump's first term. This time around, it's unclear if Apple CEO Tim Cook can get the same carveouts — despite promising investment in US manufacturing and jobs.Apple is facing a potential financial hit from Trump's tariffs on goods from foreign countries, including China. Trump doubled the tariff on goods from China from 10% to 20%, on top of existing levies, and slapped a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, beginning Tuesday.Apple, which has a large supply chain network in China, will have to navigate the effects of Trump's executive order. Morningstar estimates that 70% of iPhones are manufactured in China, while S&P Global said it's about 90% in 2025.The order could also weigh on sales of products in Greater China itself, which represented 17% of revenue last year.If the tariffs remain as they are, analysts expect Apple to make adjustments to offset the potential financial impact. However, Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said the company's plans will \"likely be in flux for some time.\"He added, \"Apple is sorting this all out now.\"Consumers can \"expect mixed signals,\" said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI's sister company, EMARKETER.Here are the options that Chatterjee and other analysts who follow Apple say the tech behemoth is considering.Avoid the tariffs altogetherCook successfully secured exemptions from the 10% tariff on goods from China during Trump's previous term, and analysts haven't counted him out this time.Apple has already said it'll add to its US footprint, including pledging a multibillion-dollar investment toward its projects and saying it plans to hire 20,000 people over the next four years. It's partly an attempt to gain exemptions for Apple during this term, Bourne said.\"We're optimistic that Apple's $500 billion investment announcement will help the firm gain an exemption from the tariffs underway,\" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said.If not, it'll have to examine other options.Bump up the price of iPhonesIt's too soon to know Apple's \"mitigation strategies\" for certain, but increasing the price of consumer goods likely isn't off the table, Chatterjee told BI.Apple launched a new iPad Air with Apple Intelligence capabilities on the same day the tariffs went into effect. The tablets come with an M3 chip and start at $599 — the same price as its predecessor from 2024.\"I wouldn't expect a knee-jerk reaction from Apple, which is why the iPad Air M3 pricing remains unchanged,\" Chatterjee said.The iPhone will be where Apple will make its \"toughest decisions,\" Bourne said. IPhone sales have stumbled in Greater China, and China's government announced plans for retaliatory tariffs on Tuesday, which could hurt them more.IPhone prices in the US haven't risen since 2020 outside of its Pro Max model going from $1099 to $1199 when the Apple Intelligence-powered iPhone 15 came out, Kerwin said. If gradual price hikes occur, analysts said Apple's best-performing regions and products, like the iPhone, will get a price bump first.Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.Shift its supply chain out of ChinaBy shifting production to \"less tariff disadvantaged locations,\" Apple would avoid absorbing the cost or placing it on consumers.It's easier said than done. Apple has fostered deep relationships with Chinese manufacturers over the years. Although it's had some victories in the attempted shift to other countries, it still relies on China for its incomparable scale of operations.For three years, Apple has shown signs that it's looking to move its supply chain away from China. The tech giant moved some of its iPhone production to India in 2022. In December, Bloomberg reported its plans to begin producing AirPods in India.However, some experts have said trying to avoid tariffs this time around would be harder, BI previously reported. Trump could target more countries than he did in his first term, and places where businesses shifted their operations to avoid tariffs might not be spared, experts told BI in February.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "It could explain why we’re getting an M3 Ultra this deep into the M4 rollout. Apple’s first Mac Studio refresh in nearly two years is a welcome update, injecting fresh life into two computers that were still getting by with M2 chips. But the company took a bit of a strange approach to the update, giving an M4-series Max chip to the lower-end Studio but an M3 Ultra chip to the high-end model. These processors are both performance upgrades from the M2 Max and M2 Ultra, and the M3 Ultra is so huge that it should have no trouble outrunning the M4 Max despite its slightly older CPU and GPU architecture. But it’s still a departure from past practice, where Apple would keep the Studio’s chip generation in lockstep.

Apple announced its first Mac Studio updates in nearly two years today, a few months after bringing the M4 and M4 Pro chips to the Mac mini. As before, Apple offers a lower-end and a higher-end configuration of the Mac Studio. The lower-end model is pretty much what you expect: It gives you the same M4 Max processor Apple introduced in the high-end MacBook Pro last year. It has up to 16 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), up to 40 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The $1,999 base model comes with 14 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), 32 GPU cores, 36GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That model's RAM can't be upgraded until you step up to the fully-enabled M4 Max, which also gets you 48GB of RAM for $300. From there, the desktop can be upgraded with either 64GB or 128GB of RAM, same as the MacBook Pro.Read full article Comments",

As expected, Apple has officially refreshed its MacBook Air lineup with its M4 chip, the same silicon we've already seen in products like the MacBook Pro, the iMac, and the Mac mini. And in most ways, it's a straightforward update, with no major changes to the laptop's physical design, screen specs, keyboard, or ports. The most important update is the price. The 13-inch M4 MacBook Air will start at $999, a $100 price cut compared to the M3 Air and the same price that Apple set for the M2 Air last year when the M3 models came out. The 15-inch model will also get a $100 cut, from $1,299 to $1,199. These baseline configurations still come with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The M2 version will continue to be sold as a budget model in some countries, but the US isn't one of them. Apple will also continue to sell a cheaper version of the M1 MacBook Air through Walmart, which it has been doing since March 2024.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "iPhone maker Apple has another reason to celebrate after emerging victorious in its iCloud storage lawsuit. The company’s iCloud storage is a sensitive topic for users with Apple devices as they don’t want to pay any kind of monthly fee, but also feel the 5GB monthly plan that’s for free is never enough. Today, Apple came out on top of a lawsuit that accused the company of illegal monopoly practices for matters like digital storage. The case claimed that this forced Apple users to pay more money for iCloud.As per District Judge Eumi Lee from California, plaintiffs failed to prove how Apple was in violation of the federal antitrust law. However, they do now have the option to alter the complaints and refile this case.The case said that the Cupertino firm was in violation of the antitrust law by enticing clients to use its iCloud to back up important data and the device’s setting files. However, it denied that it did anything wrong or unlawful.Soon after that, we saw plaintiffs arguing how Apple served as a monopoly for cloud storage on devices, as no other alternative offerings could perform specific functions like powering any iPhone restore. On top of that, the company was accused of artificially raising the prices for iCloud storage.After dismissing this case, the Judge says all the claims are very skeptical. She explained how inflating prices actually works to promote archrivals to enhance production so they get a share of the market that Apple dominates.Furthermore, the judge denied claims that buying iCloud storage is necessary for users. There was not substantial evidence about any monopoly power in the cloud storage industry, she shared. So if you're thinking the company’s 5GB storage for iCloud is changing anything soon, then that’s not the case and neither are the options for paid storage.

        "description": "Tech giant Apple has just filed a new appeal that it hopes can overturn a hidden UK order for backdoor creation. The iPhone maker made it clear that it has no interest in the demands that would give security officials from the government access to users’ encrypted data. The appeal was made to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which is a single judicial body that goes through complaints against British security services. The case is a one-of-a-kind entity that gives UK officials the chance to break encryption but has never been tested in front of the court in the past. As per a report from the Washington Post, security officials from the UK now demand that Apple produce a backdoor where officials can easily access content belonging to any Apple user worldwide. This would be found on the cloud, and the power also gives them the chance to fully see the encrypted data.Apple has previously criticized the law, publicly warning against such backdoor demands and their potential security risks. It blamed the government for demanding this kind of power to access the information in any nation, not just the UK. The Cupertino-based firm replied to the new order by pulling the ADP service from the region. So the optional level for encryption on iCloud stops companies like Apple from viewing the data of users. The fact that they disabled this security offering was a major step, and they issued a statement on the matter last month. Apple mentioned how they’ve been very clear about their stance since day one. The fact that they never designed any backdoor is proof of their thoughts on this issue and that they would never be indulging in its creation in the future too. Usually, Backdoors are required for governments, but they do come with a huge security and privacy risk. Such special access might seem harmless to some, but advocates warn that they can easily be exploited by the likes of criminal hackers. Bad actors usually rely on such vulnerabilities that are not introduced initially, but in the end, they result in tech giants offering less secure goods and services. As far as the order that Apple is appealing right now is concerned, it’s the Technical Capability notice rolled out by the Home Office under a law of 2016 called Snooper’s Charter. This bans unauthorized disclosure of material related to a warrant rolled out under the act.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: • A Powerful Tool for Volatile Markets: An In-depth Analysis of BYDFi's Strategy Trading Features• Has DeepSeek Been Using ChatGPT’s Data Without Permission?

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreApple updated its iPad and iPad Air models with new processors, alongside a storage increase for the iPad and a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air.AppleApple quietly launched a new standard iPad and two new iPad Air models through press releases on March 4. The tablets are available to preorder now before a release date on March 12.The newest iPads mainly offer slight internal upgrades over their predecessors, though Apple also increased the storage for the standard iPad and added a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air.The new 11th-generation iPad succeeds the 10th-generation iPad from 2022 as Apple's entry-level tablet at the same low starting price. Its A16 chipset represents a solid improvement over the previous iPad's A14 Bionic processor, though it remains the only tablet in Apple's lineup that lacks Apple Intelligence.The new M3 iPad Air models build on the M2 iPad Airs from May 2024, bringing a relatively modest performance boost to the same 11-inch and 13-inch form factors for the best iPads at a mid-range price.iPad (A16): Release date and priceApple's latest standard iPad, the 11th-generation iPad with the A16 processor, is available to preorder now from Apple and Best Buy ahead of its release on March 12.The 11th-generation iPad retains the same entry-level price ($349 for the WiFi-only model) as the 10th-generation iPad, though Apple increased the base storage from 64GB to 128GB and added a storage tier.128GB: $349 ($499 for WiFi + Cellular) 256GB: $449 ($599 for WiFi + Cellular)512GB: $649 ($799 for WiFi + Cellular)iPad Air (M3): Release date and priceThe new M3 iPad Air models are also open to preorder now from Apple and Best Buy before their release on March 12.Available in the long-standing 11-inch configuration and the 13-inch model introduced with the M2 iPad Airs, the M3 iPad Airs retain the same starting prices as last year's models despite the upgraded processor:11-inch, 128GB: $599 ($749 for WiFi + Cellular) 11-inch, 256GB: $699 ($849 for WiFi + Cellular) 11-inch, 512GB: $899 ($1,049 for WiFi + Cellular)11-inch, 1TB: $1,099 ($1,249 for WiFi + Cellular)13-inch, 128GB: $799 ($949 for WiFi + Cellular)13-inch, 256GB: $899 ($1,049 for WiFi + Cellular)13-inch, 512GB: $1,099 ($1,249 for WiFi + Cellular)13-inch, 1TB: $1,299 ($1,449 for WiFi + Cellular)iPad (A16): Features and upgradesThe latest standard iPad is a decent performance upgrade rather than a significant departure. AppleThe 11th-generation standard iPad largely mirrors the 10th-generation iPad from 2022, apart from a few key upgrades:A16 chip: Apple claims the new iPad's A16 chipset is 30% faster than its predecessor's A14 Bionic processor. Introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, the A16 chip makes the 11th-generation iPad incompatible with Apple Intelligence, though the entry-level tablet should be plenty capable for everyday uses like streaming, browsing, and lightly intensive tasks. Double the storage: Apple increased the value of the standard iPad by bringing its base storage up to 128GB from the 10th-generation's 64GB base tier while retaining the same starting price of $349. The company also added a new 512GB storage tier. Otherwise, the 11th-generation iPad has effectively the same design and functionality as its predecessor, with a spec-matched 11-inch Liquid Retina LED display, Touch ID, USB-C port, support for the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and first-generation Apple Pencil, 12MP wide rear camera, and a landscape-oriented 12MP front camera.It's available in the same blue, pink, yellow, and silver colors as the previous model.iPad Air (M3): Features and upgradesThe iPad Air is effectively unchanged year-over-year, apart from its new chip and compatibility with a redesigned Magic Keyboard (sold separately). AppleThe M3 iPad Air models are a comparatively minor update from the M2 iPad Airs released last year. They feature a slight performance boost and the option to add a new Apple keyboard: M3 chip: Apple claims the new iPad Air's M3 chip is twice as fast as the M1 iPad Air released in 2022. The company hasn't specified an exact performance boost over last year's M2 models, as it's likely a very slight difference in current benchmark testing. Introduced in the iMac and MacBook Pro models released in 2023, the M3 chip should nonetheless provide more power for intensive tasks, especially in the long run. New Magic Keyboard: Apple released a new Magic Keyboard specifically designed for the latest iPad Air models. Compared to the previous keyboard, it features a larger trackpad and a new row of function keys that were previously exclusive to the Magic Keyboard for the 2024 iPad Pro models. The M3 iPad Airs are otherwise essentially identical to the M2 models, with the same Liquid Retina LED displays, USB-C port, Touch ID, landscape-oriented 12MP front camera, 12MP wide rear camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C). They're available in the same Space Gray, Starlight, blue, and purple colors as last year's models. Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Google Gemini just rolled out a much needed update for iPhone users. The feature is now easily accessible through the device’s lock screen, starting today. The news comes to us thanks to tech news outlet 9to5Google, which shared the feature. This means users can make calls to Gemini Live, Google’s real-time voice assistant. So basically you benefit from the popular AI chatbot having the voice feature without the need to unlock your device.It’s great to see how it managed to beat out Apple’s own Siri voice assistant, which will be coming out with that offering by early 2027, due to extreme delays in the rollout. But it seems like there’s plenty of competition in the AI space to give iPhone users exactly what they want through other AI assistants. The feature will provide users with Apple phones the chance to see how diverse LLMs are as the company’s own LLM based Siri is miles away from a launch. Still, many do anticipate it and look forward to see what Apple has to offer despite rivals heating up the competition.ChatGPT’s iOS platform enables users to make calls to OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode through the lock screen. Meanwhile, Gemini Live isn’t the only thing that the Gemini app is turning heads with. We’re also seeing a host of other lock screen widgets such as those designed to take images using the phone’s camera and then transferring the uploads to Gemini. Then there is a feature for reminder settings and other important calendar events. Another feature allows users to jump straight into text chats through Gemini.Google also shared that it would enable Gemini users across Android to request the AI chatbot for any queries about what’s seen on the screen or for videos while getting replies in real time. Such offerings were initially shared as part of the Project Astra. The latter is the Android maker’s multimodal AI initiative that’s slowly arriving on the Gemini platform. To begin with, the offerings are up for grabs for subscribers on Google Gemini’s Advanced plan, that’s for a monthly cost of $20.So as you can see, Google is really making headway in the world of AI, not only for Android but also Apple devices.

        "description": "When Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement in 2017, major companies—including tech giants Apple, Amazon, and Google—were quick to criticize the move. Elon Musk stepped down from his role on the president’s advisory committees in response. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the decision was “bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk.” What happened this year was very different: Trump ordered the U.S. to leave the Paris Agreement, again, on his first day in office. Zuckerberg, who was getting ready to co-host an inaugural ball for the president, didn’t comment on the news. (In an unrelated Facebook post that came shortly after Trump’s announcement about the Paris Agreement, Zuckerberg said he was “Optimistic and celebrating.”) Jeff Bezos, who previously criticized Trump and poured $10 billion into climate nonprofits, has now cozied up to the president. Other tech CEOs sat in support at the inauguration and donated millions to Trump’s inaugural committee. It’s one example of the business world’s reluctance to take any public stand against the current president. “In the first term, everyone was fighting me,” Trump said at a press conference in December when he talked about meeting with tech leaders. “In this term, everyone wants to be my friend.” Whether out of a fear of retribution and/or a belief that their companies could benefit directly from Trump, most business leaders are staying quiet. That’s true both for specific policy, like the Paris Agreement, and as the new administration veers toward authoritarianism. The muted response—not to mention the fact that some executives are embracing Trump and voluntarily ditching programs like diversity, equity, and inclusion—isn’t dissimilar to what happened when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. “The parallels of corporate conformity and subservience are quite strong,” says Peter Hayes, a professor emeritus of history at Northwestern University and the author of a new book, Profits & Persecution, about how companies responded to and collaborated with the Nazi party. When Hitler came to power in 1933, few took him seriously. As with Trump, people tended to underestimate the threat he posed. “A lot of people thought Hitler was a blowhard,” Hayes says. “He never had been to university. He’d never held a government position. He’d never had a real job in his life, aside from running messages behind enemy lines in World War I. They just didn’t take him seriously. And the antisemitism, only the worst people took that seriously—the people who believed in it took it totally seriously. Everybody else tended to sort of say, ‘Well, you know, if it comes, it’ll stop short of the kind of people I know.’” At the time, business leaders liked some aspects of the Nazi platform, including its willingness to dismantle labor unions. Those who objected to Hitler’s antisemitism thought that it could be moderated. (In the culture of the time, many Germans were antisemitic themselves—and had especially objectionable views about Jewish immigrants who had recently moved from Eastern Europe—but didn’t think that their Jewish colleagues should lose their jobs or, later, their lives.) But businesses quickly became participants in the “de-Jewification” (“Entjudung”) of their corporate boards. Some of that was driven by fear, after seeing examples of what the Nazis were willing to do. In one case, the new government arrested the editors of a newspaper in Munich and appointed Nazi replacements who fired Jewish employees. The Nazis intimidated Bosch’s CEO by arresting one of his friends. A cigarette magnate was threatened with the takeover of his property and a trial on corruption charges if he didn’t do what the government wanted. “They always were willing to use force, but they treated it as a last resort towards the corporate world,” Hayes says. “Because you can intimidate ordinary middle-class or upper-class people pretty easily. And they did. People conform.” After seeing what was happening to others, some companies started to practice “anticipatory compliance,” including Deutsche Bank, which fired Jewish members of its board before it was forced to. (In the long term, it didn’t help: Two of the bank’s directors were executed later in the war because they’d criticized Hitler.) As Hitler’s regime progressed, the corporate compliance became more horrific: seizing Jewish-owned businesses and property, using forced Jewish labor, and providing, in the case of a chemical company called IG Farben, the poison gas used to kill millions of people in concentration camps. Some companies fully embraced Nazi propaganda; others were just afraid to resist. Now, as corporate leaders fail to stand up for things they’ve advocated for in the past, such as climate action, what happened in Germany “is kind of a road map for what we’re experiencing,” Hayes says. The country is at a pivotal moment. The White House is seizing power in unprecedented ways, such as freezing funding that was already appropriated by Congress. Trump broke the law to fire inspectors general at federal agencies. Under Elon Musk, who was never elected to any office, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has started slashing jobs and funding at federal agencies, from the National Institutes of Health to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (The job cuts include accidentally firing workers responsible for nuclear security and researching the bird flu outbreak.) Musk and other Republicans have threatened judges with impeachment for blocking DOGE work that the judges say is illegal. When Musk sat in at a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump threatened to throw out anyone who objected to Musk. The White House is starting to control which journalists can be part of the press pool covering the president, something that used to happen through an independent committee. The list goes on. Hayes argues that American business leaders have caved to Trump even without the same type of intimidation that happened in Germany. But there has been some pressure: Trump threatened to jail Zuckerberg if he “interfered” with the 2024 election, for example, and then credited his own threats with forcing Zuckerberg to make changes to Meta, including ditching fact-checkers. Some of the pressure on CEOs, along with politicians and other public figures, now comes in other forms, including the fact that Trump can easily incite his online followers to violence. “We have on record Republican senators who’ve said to their Democratic colleagues, ‘I can’t speak up because I’m afraid for my family,’” Hayes says, adding that corporate leaders may also be afraid to talk because they’re worried about losing their jobs. “This is the normal form of human self-protection that dictatorial and authoritarian forces totally exploit.” Hayes points out other parallels to Nazi Germany. Hitler, like Trump, didn’t worry about long-term impacts to the economy. Hitler wanted Germany to be self-sufficient, and pushed for companies to make gasoline from coal, even though it was far more expensive than importing fuel from other countries. Similarly, Trump is trying to prop up fossil fuel companies in the U.S. at a time when the rest of the world is moving to electric vehicles—and EVs ultimately make more economic sense. “We’re giving up the future to serve the fossil fuel industry in the short term, and to try to make us an island in the world,” Hayes says. “It’s not going to work. The bill will come due. And as it starts to come due, everything that Trump has ever done indicates that he will blame someone else. And that’s when this government will become truly dangerous.” In Germany, Hayes says, the first year of Hitler’s rule was the critical moment that businesses could have made different choices. In theory, it’s not too late for companies—along with the rest of society—to become more vocal now. Hayes, however, doesn’t believe that salvation is likely to come from the corporate sector, warning, “Don’t expect them to stand up to this.”",

        "description": "Apple's lower-end products may be seeing a flurry of activity soon. Apple's slow trickle of early 2025 product announcements is apparently set to continue this week, following the introduction of the iPhone 16e a couple of weeks ago. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company plans to refresh its 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air laptops \"as early as this coming week,\" adding the M4 processor that Apple put in the iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lineups last fall. An M4 refresh for the MacBook Air was always likely, but Apple has kept us guessing about the timing. Usually, the MacBook Airs are among the first devices to get new M-series processors from Apple, but Apple surprised us by bringing the M4 to the iPad Pro just a few months after introducing the M3. In mid-December, concrete references to the M4 MacBook Air appeared in the macOS 15.2 update, suggesting that the laptops were in testing, even if they weren't ready for a public launch yet. The laptops are unlikely to look too different from the current M2 or M3 MacBook Airs, which got an \"update\" of sorts last fall when Apple discontinued the versions with 8GB of RAM in favor of 16GB versions that kept the same prices.Read full article Comments",
