        "description": "My Costco grocery haul.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderCostco is buying more US-made items and rerouting inventory to avoid raising prices due to tariffs.I shopped at Costco in June and compared prices to when the tariffs were announced in April.A few items were more expensive, but most cost the same, and some had even gotten cheaper.While some retailers are raising prices due to President Donald Trump's sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on over 180 countries, Costco is taking a different approach.On Costco's third-quarter earnings call on May 29, CEO Ron Vachris said the company is buying more items produced in the US and rerouting inventory bound for US stores to locations in other countries to avoid paying tariffs and raising prices.\"We're watching pricing daily, and if not hourly, on every key commodity,\" Vachris said.This strategy was evident on my latest shopping trip.When the tariffs were announced in April, I tracked the origins of every item I purchased at Costco to see how much of my usual grocery list could be affected. Out of the 23 items I bought in April, at least 12 were imported or contained imported ingredients.I took the same grocery list to Costco in June and tracked all of the price changes I saw. While a few items from my April grocery list had gotten more expensive, most of the prices had stayed the same, and some had even decreased.Some of the changes I tracked may be due to tariffs, but they could also be regular fluctuations caused by other factors such as inflation or supply and demand. A representative for Costco declined to comment.While some of Trump's tariffs took effect immediately in April, others have been paused until July. Even as some other stores have announced increased prices due to tariffs, the measures have yet to spike prices across the board. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the consumer price index, a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers over time, increased by 0.1% in May, and the food index rose by 0.3%.Here are all of the price differences I noticed at Costco.As per usual, a long line stretched outside Manhattan's sole Costco store when I arrived just before its 10 a.m. opening.Costco in East Harlem, Manhattan.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderBeginning June 30, Costco's executive members will be able to shop an hour earlier than Gold Star members. I hope this exclusive access will mean shorter lines and a less crowded shopping experience first thing in the morning.I was surprised that most of the produce I bought cost the same as it did on my last grocery trip, even though much of it was imported.Tomatoes at Costco.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderTrump announced 25% tariffs on both Mexico and Canada in February, months before the \"Liberation Day\" establishment of \"reciprocal\" tariffs on other countries in April. Agricultural products were not subject to the new tariffs per the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but the US will begin taxing Mexican tomatoes with a 21% duty beginning July 14, the Associated Press reported.Despite being a product of Mexico with a Canadian distributor, a two-pound tomato medley from Sunset stayed the same price at $7.99.Other products of Mexico and Canada on my shopping list, such as raspberries, cucumbers, and mashed avocado packets, also cost the same as they did in April.I'd anticipated higher prices on produce at Costco as the CEOs of companies like Walmart and Target warned consumers of potential grocery price hikes due to tariffs.The one exception was grapes, which were a product of the US and cost 50 cents more than the imported grapes I bought in April.Red grapes at Costco.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderLast time I shopped at Costco in April, I bought 3 pounds of purple grapes from Chile for $7.49. On this visit in June, Costco stocked a different brand of red grapes grown in the US that cost $7.99 for a 3-pound package.In the third-quarter earnings call, Vachris said the company planned to buy more domestically made products as alternatives to increasingly expensive imported items.With a domestic supplier, the grapes still slightly increased in price, which could be due to different production and labor costs at the new supplier.Kirkland's organic roasted seaweed, sourced from South Korea, cost a dollar more than it did in April — a 9% price increase from $10.99 to $11.99.Kirkland-brand roasted seaweed.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderTrump imposed a 25% tariff on South Korea.The price of Kind bars, which are made in the US, had decreased by about 11.5% since my last trip.Kind bars at Costco.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderThe box of 22 bars said that they were made in the US \"with domestic and imported ingredients.\" The price of the Kind bars decreased from $19.99 in April to $17.69 in June.The price of Costco's Kirkland-brand lemonade went up 10 cents, from $6.29 in April to $6.39 in June for two 3-quart bottles.Kirkland-brand lemonade.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderCostco's US branch distributes the lemonade, but the label doesn't say where it was produced or where its ingredients were sourced.If the lemons used are not grown in the US, it's possible that they've become more expensive to import due to tariffs. India, Mexico, and China are the top three lemon producers in the world, The Takeout reported, and were all hit with steep tariffs: 26% on India, 25% on Mexico, and 10% on China.Costco didn't respond to a request for comment.Other juices on my shopping list, such as gallon-sized bottles of passion orange guava juice, cost the same as they did in April at $5.99 each.Some price changes were due to limited-time sales, like a $3 discount on Nature's Path organic granola.Granola at Costco.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderNature's Path organic granola was on sale for $5.99 during my June shopping trip. I'd previously paid $8.99 in April.The pumpkin seed and flax granola comes in 35.5-ounce bags. Nature's Path's website says that it \"does not currently purchase any products internationally that would require 'product of…' labeling.\"Egg prices at Costco decreased dramatically.Eggs at Costco.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderIn February, I bought a carton of 24 cage-free large eggs at Costco for $8.49. I was lucky to even get one — the supply ran out just minutes after the store opened due to shortages caused by avian flu.Things have improved steadily since then as the bird flu outbreak has become better contained. When I shopped at Costco in April, a carton of 24 cage-free large eggs cost $7.69. In June, the price lowered to $5.79, with an overall decrease of around 32% since February.Overall, prices at Costco hadn't changed much. Their strategy appears to be working.My Costco grocery haul.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderOut of the 23 items on my grocery list I compared from April, only three became more expensive, and three decreased in price.On the third-quarter earnings call, Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said that keeping prices low for members pays off despite squeezed profit margins. When prices eventually fall, he said, it allows the company to \"feel the margin relief faster while also being able to lower prices more quickly than our competitors.\"I'm grateful Costco has largely kept its prices the same, choosing to lower profit margins instead of passing higher costs on to consumers.Read the original article on Business Insider My Costco grocery haul.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderCostco is buying more US-made items and rerouting inventory to avoid raising prices due to tariffs.I shopped at Costco in June and compared prices to when the tariffs were announced in April.A few items were more expensive, but most cost the same, and some had even gotten cheaper.While some retailers are raising prices due to President Donald Trump's sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on over 180 countries, Costco is taking a different approach.On Costco's third-quarter earnings call on May 29, CEO Ron Vachris said the company is buying more items produced in the US and rerouting inventory bound for US stores to locations in other countries to avoid paying tariffs and raising prices.\"We're watching pricing daily, and if not hourly, on every key commodity,\" Vachris said.This strategy was evident on my latest shopping trip.When the tariffs were announced in April, I tracked the origins of every item I purchased at Costco to see how much of my usual grocery list could be affected.

Last June, conservative activist Robby Starbuck launched a campaign targeting “woke” companies, threatening boycotts unless they renounced their policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through the end of 2024, many companies buckled, including Tractor Supply Co., John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and Walmart. The movement’s momentum continued to grow after the November election, claiming McDonald’s, Target, Amazon, Meta, PBS, and others.",

        "description": "I work as a dietitian and help clients with weight loss and management. Some Costco staples help me (and my clients) stay consistent and eat well.Vanessa ImusI'm a registered dietitian and mom who helps busy parents lose weight and maintain weight loss.I try to stock up on nutrient-dense foods from Costco, from easy dinners to satisfying snacks.Kirkland Signature quinoa and mixed nuts are pantry staples for me, and I like Rao's marinara.I'm a registered dietitian who specializes in helping busy parents lose weight without restrictive diets.As a mom of three myself, I know weight management can be especially difficult when you've got a family to feed. Preparing healthy family meals feels like a Herculean task on busy weeknights between work responsibilities and after-school activities.Having nutritious, balanced foods on hand is half the battle — fortunately, I've found great bulk buys at Costco that come in handy when life gets overwhelming.Here are a few things I get at the wholesale retailer to help me (and my clients) consistently eat well while supporting sustainable weight management.Trident Alaska salmon burgers are great for a quick dinner.Trident Alaska Salmon burgers use wild-caught salmon.Vanessa ImusA freezer staple in our home, these Trident Alaska salmon burgers from Costco can be ready to eat in 10 minutes or less.Throw the patty on top of a whole-grain bun, add a salad or some roasted veggies on the side, and dinner's done.I love that the burgers are made with wild-caught salmon and loaded with heart-healthy omega-3s.I always try to keep riced cauliflower on hand.A bag of Tattooed Chef organic riced cauliflower can last us a while.Vanessa ImusI love using cauliflower rice instead of brown rice to add more nutrition, fiber, and bulk to my meals without carbohydrate overload.This frozen bag from Tattooed Chef is great because I can easily heat and eat a single serving or a larger portion.Premade meals from Kevin's Natural Foods come in handy on busy evenings.Costco usually has a few meals in stock from Kevin's Natural FoodsVanessa ImusMeals from Kevin's Natural Foods are perfect for those \"nothing's defrosted but I don't want to derail my weight-loss efforts\" kind of nights.From Korean BBQ-style beef to roasted-garlic chicken, these heat-and-eat entrées are ready in minutes and packed with protein to make them extra satisfying.Pair them with precooked rice or riced cauliflower for a more filling dinner.The Kirkland Signature chunky guacamole cups are convenient.Kirkland Signature chunky guacamole cups are easy to take on the go.Vanessa ImusPortion-controlled, portable, and super satisfying, Kirkland Signature chunky guacamole cups are a staple for me.Each cup contains 4 grams of fiber plus heart-healthy fats that can be great for stabilizing blood sugar and keeping you feeling full for longer.I like to dip veggies or tortilla chips in these for a midday snack.I keep mixed berries in the freezer.Frozen berries can be used for smoothies, yogurt bowls, and more.Vanessa ImusI toss frozen berries into oatmeal or yogurt for an easy dose of fiber, antioxidants, and natural sweetness.This four-berry blend is also great for nutrient-dense smoothies — I blend them with baby spinach, frozen banana, and a splash of water.It's easy to make dishes more nutritious with baby spinach.It's easy to add baby spinach to salads.Vanessa ImusBaby spinach is a no-brainer for sneaking more greens into your meals. It's easy to add to smoothies, eggs, and sandwiches — or to use as the base for a quick side salad.Pre-cooked chicken bites come in handy for lunches.The chicken bites can be used on a salad or in a wrap.Vanessa ImusWith 24 grams of protein per pouch, these fully cooked Fresh Station chicken-breast bites are a lunch lifesaver.They can be the star of a balanced salad or wrap that can help keep your blood sugar stable midday.Kirkland Signature egg bites can be an easy breakfast.High in protein and ready in seconds, Kirkland Signature sous-vide egg-white bites make breakfast easy.Vanessa ImusSome people skip breakfast because they're busy or want to \"save calories,\" but that typically backfires when it comes to weight management.Skipping breakfast can throw off your blood sugar for the whole day, so I suggest having even just a quick meal in the morning.These Kirkland Signature sous-vide egg-white bites are one of my favorite easy breakfasts because they cook in minutes and have 11 grams of protein per serving.I also try to keep protein bars on hand.Sometimes, I keep G2G protein bars in my purse.Vanessa ImusStash protein bars in your purse, glove box, diaper bag, or desk to ensure you aren't skipping snacks on even the busiest of days — doing so can lead to sugar cravings or overeating at mealtime.Sometimes, I grab G2G bars at Costco. They're filling and each has 18 grams of protein.RxBars are also a solid pick.RxBars have simple ingredients.Vanessa ImusOne of my other favorite protein-packed Costco buys is RxBars.They have 12 grams of protein per serving, and I like their simple ingredients.Kirkland Signature mixed nuts are great to keep on hand.Try pairing mixed nuts with fruit for a decent snack.Vanessa ImusMixed nuts are a great grab-and-go snack with healthy fats, protein, and fiber.Pair a handful of nuts with some high-fiber, antioxidant-rich fruit, like berries or an apple, to create the perfect blood-sugar balancing snack that'll help keep you full between meals.Quinoa is a great whole grain to serve with dinner.I buy Kirkland Signature organic quinoa to keep in my pantry.Vanessa ImusQuinoa is one of my favorite fiber-rich whole grains that's ideal for busy weeknights.It only takes about 20 minutes to prepare in a rice cooker, and it pairs well with most proteins, from salmon to chicken.I always grab a salad kit or two from Costco.Braga Farms blueberry-basil salad kit is nice and simple.Vanessa ImusCostco typically has a great variety of salad kits, which keep my meals interesting.The kits are great for busy weeknights since they typically include pre-washed lettuce, toppings, and a premade dressing. Plus, using them to fill half of your dinner plate with veggies is a surefire way to maximize your nutrition intake.Chicken sausages are good to keep on hand.Aidells chicken and apple sausages pair well with veggies.Vanessa ImusAidells chicken sausages can be a great protein for quick meals since they're fully cooked. I like to slice the sausages and pop them in the oven or on the stovetop with veggies.These are also a great, simpler alternative to hot dogs at a barbecue.Rao's Homemade marinara is a staple for me.Rao's Homemade marinara is one of my favorite sauces to buy.Vanessa ImusI've found it's difficult to find delicious premade pasta sauce that doesn't have added sugar or sweeteners. Fortunately, Rao's Homemade marinara fits the bill.The sauce pairs well with chickpea or lentil pasta, which can be good sources of fiber and protein.Skinny Pop is an easy, light snack.Costco sells small bags of Skinny Pop in bulk.Vanessa ImusSkinny Pop popcorn is good for satisfying salty, crunchy snack cravings. Each 100-calorie bag is made with just popcorn, oil, and salt.I love the simple ingredients and how easy these are to throw in a lunch bag.Click to keep reading Costco diaries like this one.Read the original article on Business Insider I work as a dietitian and help clients with weight loss and management.

The retailer said it generated earnings per share of $4.28 for the quarter ended May 11, above what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The metric suggests that Costco is growing its business even as consumers prioritize necessities to save money. Burt Flickinger, Managing Director of Strategic Resource Group, reacts to Costco's earnings and examines the health of other key players in the retail sector, including Walmart, The Gap and Ulta Beauty.

        "description": "Customers exit a Costco Warehouse in Pennsylvania.Gene Puskar/APCostco rerouted some imports and found US-made alternatives in the wake of tariffs, executives said.The chain also dealt with higher butter and egg costs by taking a profit-margin hit on some items.Costco tracks key commodity prices \"daily, and if not hourly,\" its CEO said.Shoppers have faced higher prices due to tariffs and bird flu this year.Costco, meanwhile, has worked to avoid price hikes on many items thanks to a multi-pronged approach, executives said during the retailer's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday.As the threat of tariffs became real during the quarter, which included President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" Costco brought in some merchandise for summer earlier than usual and purchased more US-made inventory, CEO Ron Vachris said during the call.The chain also rerouted some goods it had already purchased for its US stores to its locations abroad in order to avoid paying the tariffs.Costco's buyers have looked at specific items to figure out whether it can source US-made alternatives to suddenly more-expensive imports, Vachris said.\"Is it something that we can replace with something domestically here, or is it something that we need to go ahead and move on quickly and bring in prior to any future tariff increases?\" he said.Higher costs for some grocery staples, namely butter and eggs, also provided a challenge for Costco over the last few months. Besides being common purchases for Costco customers, those two items have a large \"halo effect\" on the costs of other goods that require them as ingredients, Vachris said.Costco's buyers talk to vendors regularly about lowering costs, the CEO said.\"We're watching pricing daily, and if not hourly, on every key commodity,\" Vachris said.That doesn't mean that Costco is raising prices for those items, though. In fact, the chain's profit margins on specific products have taken a hit.Often, when the price that a retailer pays for an item goes up, stores raise the price that consumers pay in part or in full to protect their profit. That's exactly what many retailers did earlier this year when the cost of eggs skyrocketed as bird flu killed many egg-laying chickens and drove supply down.Costco said it avoided raising prices on eggs and butter as its costs for those things went up — leading some customers to line up early. The wholesale warehouse chain cut egg prices by 10% and butter prices by about 7% during its third quarter, CFO Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call Thursday.The retailer also held back on price increases on items that use those ingredients, Millerchip said.One example: The croissants in Costco's in-store bakeries.The company \"held prices lower when butter costs were elevated,\" he said. As butter prices have fallen, Costco's profit margin on that item has expanded, Millerchip said.\"In general, we feel margin pressure during times of inflation on these types of ingredients as we keep prices low for our members,\" Millerchip said. \"And the opposite is often true when prices fall, as we feel the margin relief faster while also being able to lower prices more quickly than our competitors.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Customers exit a Costco Warehouse in Pennsylvania.Gene Puskar/APCostco rerouted some imports and found US-made alternatives in the wake of tariffs, executives said.The chain also dealt with higher butter and egg costs by taking a profit-margin hit on some items.Costco tracks key commodity prices \"daily, and if not hourly,\" its CEO said.Shoppers have faced higher prices due to tariffs and bird flu this year.Costco, meanwhile, has worked to avoid price hikes on many items thanks to a multi-pronged approach, executives said during the retailer's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday.As the threat of tariffs became real during the quarter, which included President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" Costco brought in some merchandise for summer earlier than usual and purchased more US-made inventory, CEO Ron Vachris said during the call.The chain also rerouted some goods it had already purchased for its US stores to its locations abroad in order to avoid paying the tariffs.Costco's buyers have looked at specific items to figure out whether it can source US-made alternatives to suddenly more-expensive imports, Vachris said.\"Is it something that we can replace with something domestically here, or is it something that we need to go ahead and move on quickly and bring in prior to any future tariff increases?\" he said.Higher costs for some grocery staples, namely butter and eggs, also provided a challenge for Costco over the last few months.

During the same shopping trip, I can also grab pupusas and birria tacos.For these reasons, as a mother who shops weekly for my household of four, Costco used to be our weekly go-to destination. But the store has become so busy that I can barely get in the door anymore.With two hangry children in the car whose patience for grocery shopping can only be coaxed with promises (or bribes) of getting to pick their own weekly snacks, I've had to rethink my grocery shopping.My local Costco has become too popularI live in Torrance, Calif., which has a large Costco. It's known to be one of the busier locations.It routinely appears on rankings and lists like the \"most Asian\" Costco in SoCal, simply one of the best in the state, or the most \"elite\" in the country.Those rankings have ultimately become both a blessing and a curse. The parking lot there has always been a chaotic mess, but lately, it's become impossible to maneuver.My last three attempts to visit have failed because I could not find a single parking spot in the lot. I had to leave completely and ended up buying none of my favorite items.I've been forced to replace my favorite Costco items with food from other stores.I've been on the hunt for Costco alternatives at AldiI used to buy all our organic, free-range, and \"natural\" dairy products from Costco, especially the milk, eggs, and coffee creamer our family couldn't live without. These days, whenever I can't find a space in their parking lot, I buy the Aldi versions. Recently, the eggs at Aldi cost me less than $7.Getting my kids (and husband) to eat vegetables is an ongoing battle. I used to fight this battle by buying a giant bag of organic spinach at Costco once a week and challenging us as a family to finish before any of the leaves wilted. Now, I try to do the same with the bulk-sized organic salad mixes, also courtesy of Aldi, which costs less than $5.We don't live solely on white meat, so while I used to get our rib-eye steaks and marinated bulgogi from the butcher's section of Costco, now I get seasoned pork pastor and carne asada from Aldi for around $5 and steaks from whatever is on sale at Amazon Fresh.Admittedly, there are a few things I've had a harder time finding the dupes for. No Costco trip is complete without their iconic $5 rotisserie chicken, and this remains one of their hardest products to replace.Costco's individually wrapped bags of organic edamame also remain elusive. While I can easily find smaller bags of frozen young soybeans in any Asian grocer, none of them have the convenience and bulk of the membership warehouse I used to love but am now learning to live without.I won't give up on Costco, though. I still periodically drive into the parking lot to see if I can snag a spot.

My day job is as a creative director and writer, but my \"delicious job\" is as a barbecue pitmaster and competition cook. In Buffalo, New York, I take advantage of the beautiful spring and summer weather by grilling and smoking food as much as possible. During the fall and winter, it's all about tailgate season. I love picking up my ingredients and supplies at Costco because the quality of proteins and products is usually fantastic. Plus I can also stock up on things that'll last for months. Here are 13 of my Costco essentials when it comes to barbecuing. Editor's Note: Item price and availability may vary.Big bags of Kingsford charcoal are a necessity.Kingsford charcoal is one of my favorites to buy.Eammon AziziIn my experience, Costco is also one of the few places where I can find the highest quality briquettes at such a low price. Typically, I pick up a 36-pound package of Kingsford charcoal. This brand is my favorite for searing because the briquettes burn extremely hot and clean. I use these when cooking steaks, burgers, and even hot dogs. Tents can make barbecuing easier.Tents help keep me and my food in the shade.Eammon AziziInstead of fighting the sun or wet weather while I barbecue, I always have at least one or two tents up. Tents also keep food from sitting in the sun or getting rained (or snowed) on. I'm always ready to bring out some folding tables.Folding tables come in handy for cooking.Eammon AziziFolding tables are essential and extremely useful when it comes to barbecuing and prepping food. I always have two or three of these up on my patio — one for prep, one for tools, and the last for plating. Because the tables fold up compactly, they also fit into a car or truck for easy transport. Swift pork-loin backribs cook up beautifully.Swift backribs are great in a smoker.Eammon AziziWhen I season up and put a rack of ribs on the smoker on the first nice day of the year, I know it's officially barbecue season.These Swift backribs at Costco usually come in packs of three, which fit perfectly on my smoker.I cook mine to the point where I can get a perfect clean bite that comes off the bone without all of the meat falling off with it. Costco's Kirkland Signature label has solid meat options for when I want to try something new.I always check to see what Kirkland Signature has on offer.Eammon AziziI'm always looking for something new to cook, and Kirkland Signature usually has some decent options, like a rack of lamb.I like making a rub with a few herbs, searing the rack, and then cooking it to a perfect medium. I finish the meat at an internal temperature of around 125 degrees Fahrenheit.And, in my opinion, if you don't think you like lamb, it's probably because it was overcooked. Big, sturdy coolers are an absolute must if you're barbecuing.Coolers can help meat hold its temperature.Eammon AziziCoolers are a must for any barbecuer — and they do more than just keep meat and beverages cold.When I cook something that finishes early, like a brisket or pork shoulder, I cover the meat in foil so it can rest, wrap that with a towel, then place it in a cooler.This way, the meat holds its temperature for a few hour,s and I can pull it out when everyone's ready to eat.Folding wagons are incredibly helpful.I use folding wagons to transport supplies.Eammon AziziFolding wagons are such a great help, especially if you're cooking at a park or location that's not your home base.I'll fill it with things like ingredients and utensils to roll from the parking lot to the barbecue spot. Costco is also a decent place to pick up cookers or smokers.I like cooking with charcoal.Eammon AziziOf course, we can't forget the actual grill or smoker. I'm a charcoal cooker, but some of my barbecue buds love cooking on pellet, propane, and electric smokers.In my opinion, though, just choose whichever cooker helps you get the job done right. I always get my foil in bulk.I go through a lot of foil when I cook.Eammon AziziIt's amazing how much foil I go through when I'm cooking outdoors.First off, I use it to overcome the stall — when you're smoking a large piece of meat and the internal temperature of it stops rising or goes down — on big cuts of meat. Wrapping the meat with foil can help. I also use foil to cover raw meat, pack in flavor, and dish out leftovers.Kirkland Signature Stretch-Tite wrap is also a must-have when it's time to barbecue.I buy big rolls of Kirkland Signature Stretch-Tite wrap .Eammon AziziOf course, with meat, we also have side dishes. Instead of leaving the sides out unprotected, I like to use Stretch-Tite to cover bowls and serving dishes.It's also a great place to get gloves for food prep.Gloves can be really helpful when it comes to trying to safely pepare food.Eammon AziziI'm big on food safety, so I always have boxes of nitrile gloves handy for handling meat. I choose nitrile because they're durable, stretchy, and never have a powdery substance or aroma that can transfer to food.I buy water in bulk at Costco, too.Costco is a solid place to find affordable water bottles.Eammon AziziIt gets hot when you're standing by the grill or smoker all day. These big packs of water keep me hydrated. Lastly, Costco is a solid spot to buy yard games that keep me and my group entertained while I barbecue.I've found cornhole at Costco.Eammon AziziSometimes it takes an hour or two to finish cooking, so I make sure to have something fun for everyone to do while we wait.Yard games, like cornhole, are a safe bet — and Costco usually has a decent selection of them.Click to keep reading Costco diaries like this one.This story was originally published on June 18, 2023, and most recently updated on May 19, 2025.Read the original article on Business Insider I'm a barbecue pitmaster who regularly shops at Costco.Eammon AziziI'm a creative director and writer, but I'm also a barbecue pitmaster who loves shopping at Costco.I get barbecuing essentials at Costco like Kingsford charcoal and Kirkland's Stretch-Tite wrap.I also buy yard games, foil, water bottles, and meat in bulk.

Big, sturdy coolers are an absolute must if you're barbecuing.Coolers can help meat hold its temperature.Eammon AziziCoolers are a must for any barbecuer — and they do more than just keep meat and beverages cold.When I cook something that finishes early, like a brisket or pork shoulder, I cover the meat in foil so it can rest, wrap that with a towel, then place it in a cooler.This way, the meat holds its temperature for a few hour,s and I can pull it out when everyone's ready to eat.Folding wagons are incredibly helpful.I use folding wagons to transport supplies.Eammon AziziFolding wagons are such a great help, especially if you're cooking at a park or location that's not your home base.I'll fill it with things like ingredients and utensils to roll from the parking lot to the barbecue spot.

Affirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions. The financial services company announced the collaboration Thursday (May 8) in a shareholder letter. Customers, if approved, will be to able select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco’s website. “[We] are proud to announce our online partnership with Costco — a brand and a retailer I have personally admired for a long time because of their unwavering commitment to customer experience and transparency,” Affirm CEO Max Levchin wrote. “It will be a privilege to deliver honest financial products to their members.” Costco has been looking for ways to use BNPL to drive loyalty for some time. In 2023, the warehouse club chain partnered with Citi for Costco Anywhere Visa cardmembers to access the Citi Flex Pay BNPL option to pay for purchases. Affirm, for its part, has been expanding availability across several sectors. This month, the company launched a partnership with airline-owned network UATP to enable travelers to use BNPL. In April, fashion retailer Revolve Group announced it was integrating Affirm’s pay later functionality. The adoption of pay-over-time options has become more prevalent among consumers as an alternative to traditional credit cards, particularly amid rising interest rates and elevated inflation. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Pay Later Revolution: Redefining the Credit Economy,” the size of the BNPL market in the U.S. now amounts to $175 billion and usage is on the rise. Near the end of 2024, 38% of U.S. consumers were using BNPL, up from 24% the year prior. While some consumers are adopting the payment method by choice, using it to optimize cash flow and manage payment for larger purchases, others are using it out of necessity. Individuals doing so by choice spend more on average using BNPL ($777) than those using it because they have to ($576), according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “New Data: Defining the New Buy Now, Pay Later Consumer.” Amid economic uncertainty, many consumers are turning to the option to manage their spending. “[People] want certainty — especially in an environment where, economically, things are a bit uncertain,” Versatile Credit CEO Ed O’Donnell told PYMNTS in March. “Planning is important and confidence is important — [and with pay later] you can create your own confidence within your own budget.” The post Affirm, Costco Launch BNPL Partnership for eCommerce appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

She later received a letter from Costco that said the employee was fired, the case was closed, and that \"we hope and expect\" that the information would continue to remain confidential, according to filings.The NLRB and Georg each declined to comment for this story, and neither Costco nor its attorney responded to Business Insider's request.In a briefing, Costco's lawyer Paul Galligan argued that the confidentiality rules are intended to protect the integrity of the investigation and are in the shared interest of the company and workers.\"It helps employees to be candid in their statements knowing that their statements will be treated confidentiality. It is probably more critical in an industry like retail where employees work closely together,\" Galligan said.He also said in the briefing the rules aren't intended to dissuade employees from discussing things like wages, working conditions, or forming a union.But Costco's investigation found that the individual about whom Georg complained also had several prior complaints filed against him, and Georg later testified she felt she or her coworkers with similar experiences felt they might be risking their jobs if they shared information about alleged patterns of behavior by an individual employee about whom they had raised concerns.A more tailored confidentiality agreement could still protect sensitive information while still assuring workers of their rights to protect themselves against harassment, the NLRB attorneys said in a brief.The NLRB attorneys argued that Costco's policy \"appears to instead protect the harasser who has had individual complaints dismissed over and over, because no one outside the investigator is privy to the serial nature of the harassment.\"Costco's lawyer argued that the company's employee handbook explains that the confidentiality requirement is not intended to discourage workers from exercising their rights. The NLRB argued, and the judge agreed, that having workers sign a separate form (as was the case here) could reasonably cause confusion for a typical worker and lead them to fear for their job.Part of Judge Gollin's proposed remedy is that Costco post a notice in the one warehouse where the violation occurred, since the NLRB did not prove conclusively that similar confidentiality forms were used at all of the company's US locations.The case now heads to the NLRB's board, with exceptions to the decision due by June 2.Got a tip?

        "description": "SharkNinja has announced the voluntary recall of more than 1.8 million units of Foodi multi-function pressure cookers after more than 100 reports of burn injuries—many of them serious. Here’s what you need to know about the SharkNinja pressure cooker recall. What’s happened? On May 1, home appliance company SharkNinja issued a recall for some of its SharkNinja pressure cookers, according to a notice posted on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website. The recall covers more than 1.8 million units of SharkNinja’s Foodi OP300 Series Multi-Function Pressure Cookers. The recall was issued after the company received 106 reports of burn injuries from people interacting with the cookers. The company has discovered that the pressure-cooking lids of the recalled units can be opened while the cooker is pressurized. This could result in “burn injuries from hot contents” in the cooker, according to the company’s recall notice. In addition to the cooking units themselves, SharkNinja is also recalling lid replacements for the units that were sold separately. What pressure cooker is being recalled? SharkNinja says the recall covers the “Ninja”-brand “Foodi” OP300-series Pressure Cookers/TenderCrisp Air. The following model numbers of that series are being recalled: OP300 OP300C OP301 OP301A OP301C OP302 OP302BRN OP302HAQ OP302HB OP302HCN OP302HW OP305 OP305CO OP305CCO OP350CO In addition to the models above, the OP300 lid replacement with the SKU 111FY300 has also been recalled. How many SharkNinja OP300-series units are affected? According to the notice posted on the CPSC website, about 1,846,400 units are being recalled, as well as about 184,240 that were sold in Canada. Where were the recalled units sold? According to the CPSC, the recalled pressure cookers were sold at some of the largest retailers nationwide. They were sold in both physical retail stores and online. The physical retail stores where the recalled units were sold at include: Walmart Costco Sam’s Club Amazon Target The recalled pressure cookers were also sold online at: Ninjakitchen.com walmart.com costco.com samsclub.com amazon.com target.com The recalled units were sold from January 2019 through March 2025. Each unit retailed for around $200. Have the recalled products injured anyone? Unfortunately, yes. SharkNinja says that it has received 106 reports of burn injuries involving the recalled products. Even worse, more than 50 of those injuries included second- or third-degree burns to a person’s body or face. What should I do if I have a recalled product? If you have the recalled pressure cooker or lid, you should immediately stop using the pressure cooker and ensure that no one else who has access to the pressure cooker uses it. You should then fill out the Ninja OP300 Series Recall form here. Once you’ve submitted the form, SharkNinja will send you a replacement lid. You should also dispose of your current faulty lid. You can view the full CPSC recall notice here, as well as SharkNinja’s full FAQ on the recall here.",

        "description": "Branded is a weekly column devoted to the intersection of marketing, business, design, and culture. Costco has been on a good run lately. The beloved big-box club chain has been winning new fans for its no-nonsense stand on continuing its DEI policies, with comparable store sales up 6.8% in its most recent quarter. But as Costco shoppers know, its in-house Kirkland Signature brand, which includes everything from underwear to frozen pizza, has long been the discount club’s not-so-secret weapon. Kirkland marks its 30th anniversary this year, and in what’s shaping up to be a challenging economy for consumers across the board, it’s poised to become more important than ever. Kirkland-branded products (excluding gas) already account for nearly a quarter of Costco sales—some $56 billion in its fiscal year that ended September 1. That makes Kirkland bigger by revenue than Nike ($51 billion last year) or Netflix ($39 billion). Like all private labels, it competes with brand-name consumer products largely on price—an obvious advantage in belt-tightening times. But Kirkland is also the rare private label that’s developed its own powerful, and surprisingly elastic, brand identity. When it was founded in 1983, Costco offered only name-brand goods, but over time the company became concerned with rising prices, sometimes even when underlying commodity prices were going the other way. So it decided to jump on the then-burgeoning trend of creating lower-priced house-brand alternatives. At first, it followed the practice of Sears and other major players of that era who created multiple distinct private brands for different categories. But ultimately this struck management as confusing: Consumers couldn’t be expected to associate dozens of newly invented brand names with Costco. Kirkland Signature—first used on vitamins and shampoo, in 1995—was named after the Seattle suburb where Costco was based at the time. The biggest-selling Kirkland products tend to be staples like toilet paper, paper towels, and bottled water. But as the label has developed a quality reputation, Costco has gradually become more and more adventurous about where the brand can go, and there are now an estimated 500-plus Kirkland-branded products, from high-end liquor to aluminum foil to sushi. It’s hard to think of any other single brand successfully competing in such a dizzying array of categories. Meanwhile, the discounter’s core strategy of limiting choices in each category and generally offering far fewer SKUs (stock-keeping units) than most big-box stores ended up making Kirkland even more potent. A few years ago, according to The Wall Street Journal, Costco decided Kirkland would become one of its two diaper offerings—meaning either Huggies or Pampers had to go. Costco and Huggies-maker Kimberly-Clark made a deal to manufacture the Kirkland diapers; Huggies stayed. (Costco later switched to another manufacturer, but Huggies kept its slot.) Speculating about which big brands actually make Kirkland products—are its apparent dupes of a popular pair of Lululemon pants actually made by Lululemon?—is a Costco-fan pastime. Costco generally doesn’t comment (and did not respond to an inquiry from Fast Company), but it’s widely accepted that Starbucks supplies some Kirkland coffee, its batteries are made by Duracell, and Bumble Bee supplies its tuna fish. And plenty of Kirkland’s supply partners are quite open about the relationship: Ocean Spray’s logo is right below Kirkland’s on its cranberry juice bottles. And while Grey Goose has in the past denied supplying its vodka, Oregon’s Deschutes Brewery has put its logo on the popular Kirkland Signature Helles-Style Lager it now brews for Costco. Traditional brands continue to outsell private label alternatives by a wide margin, but store-brand sales continue to grow. (Target, Walmart, and others still have multiple private labels, but direct Costco rival Sam’s Club has moved to a similar model built around its Member’s Mark cross-category house brand.) And Costco has reiterated that it believes it can continue to grow private-label sales. While it’s not yet clear what the full fallout of the Trump administration’s nascent and ever-changing trade war policies will look like, it’s a safe bet that shoppers are going to become increasingly price-sensitive this year; the Conference Board’s “expectations” index of forward-looking consumer sentiment has plunged, with tariffs a cited concern. That means more interest in lower-cost private labels in general—but maybe especially for a private label with a quality reputation. It may not be as attention-grabbing as a $1.50 hot dog, but Kirkland Signature seems positioned to become more popular than ever.",

Flittering across the internet are age-old rumors claiming that some Kirkland goods are actually rebranded Vuori joggers, Grey Goose vodka, or Pureology shampoo, just to name a few.With online discourse swirling around the issue of luxury dupes and direct-from-the-factory purchases, the question on everyone’s mind right now is, “Can you actually get the real thing for a fraction of the price?”As a longtime Costco fan myself, I am no stranger to this sort of speculation. Who doesn’t love the thought of getting away with something as spectacular as snagging 2.5 pounds of coffee beans, allegedly roasted by Starbucks, for $20? A similar question crossed my mind when I discovered the Kirkland Signature Men’s 5-Pocket Performance Pants. From the design details to the fabric, I couldn’t help but notice how similar they are to the Lululemon ABC 5 Pocket Pants, which have become a near-integral part of the men’s business-casual uniform over the past few years.So I put my detective hat on and investigated: Are Kirkland’s $20 pants dupes of Lululemon’s beloved $130 ABC pants?",

        "description": "Warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club saw a boost in visitors at the end of March, before Trump's latest tariffs were scheduled to take effect. Some shoppers appeared to have gravitated toward Costco in the days before Donald Trump's latest tariffs were set to take effect.Talia Lakritz/Business InsiderShoppers have a plan for avoiding tariffs: Costco.Warehouse club chains saw a jump in foot traffic at the end of March, according to Placer.ai.Costco and Sam's Club rely on store brands, which might be attractive to tariff-wary buyers.American shoppers are flocking to stores like Costco and Walmart's Sam's Club for refuge from tariffs.Foot traffic at those sorts of stores — known in the retail industry as \"warehouse clubs\" — spiked 9.7% between March 24 and March 30 on a year-over-year basis, according to location-data provider Placer.ai. Visits were down at both grocery stores and superstores for the same period.That \"indicates a possible pull forward in demand during the weeks leading up to the expected implementation of the latest tariffs — particularly at 'stock-up' retailers like warehouse clubs,\" R.J. Hottovy, the head of analytical research at Placer.ai, wrote in a post on Friday.The data aren't perfect, Hottovy added, saying that they compare the last full week of March 2025 with the same week in 2024, which included higher-than-normal foot traffic as consumers shopped for an early Easter last year.Costco did some stocking up of its own ahead of tariffs. Executives said in an earnings call last month that the retailer was bringing in extra inventory to the US to soften the blow of the duties.Some shoppers started stockpiling essentials, such as meat and skincare products, after President Donald Trump announced a series of tariffs on goods originating everywhere from France to Vietnam at the start of this month.On Wednesday, Trump paused many of those tariffs for 90 days. At the same time, he upped duties on imports from China to 145%, escalating the US's conflict with one of its most important trading partners.While it's still early, other retailers have also started to see evidence of stockpiling. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday that some data indicated that shoppers were pulling forward some purchases.Warehouse club chains tend to focus on underpricing other retailers for essentials by selling items in bulk and under their own store brands instead of national ones.\"Consumers are likely to increasingly gravitate toward retailers that offer bulk purchasing, strong private-label alternatives, and everyday low prices,\" Placer.ai's Hottovy wrote. Those are \"areas where warehouse clubs and discount grocers with robust private-label assortments excel.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Branded is a weekly column devoted to the intersection of marketing, business, design, and culture. For years, Target wore the halo among big-box retail brands: It may not have been the cheapest, but Tar-zhay offered solid value, often through collaborations with top designers, while enjoying a forward-looking and enlightened reputation. But it’s become increasingly clear that for many shoppers, the halo has been passed—to Costco. And it’s paying off for the big-box club chain. The proximate cause of this divergence seems clear enough. Decisions made by Target to pull back on diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, which included efforts to explicitly support Black-owned brands and welcome LGBTQ+ consumers, alienated some of its regulars. Meanwhile, Costco reaffirmed its own DEI commitments as simply good for business and while that sparked some boycott chatter in the anti-“woke” mob, it didn’t amount to much. Simultaneously, the big-box club chain has put a fresh emphasis on putting higher-end in its bargain mix, including literal gold bars. Target’s initial announcement that it was paring back DEI initiatives sparked immediate complaints and boycott vows—and a notable chunk of those disaffected consumers seem to be sticking to their guns. In a recent report on DEI cuts’ impact on retail, analytics firm Numerator estimated that Target drew almost 5 million fewer store visits in a four-week stretch ending in February compared to the year before. Costco, in contrast, enjoyed 7.7 million more visits in the same stretch. The report pointed out that “DEI-sensitive groups” were a notable contributor to the trend. Latino shoppers, for example, made up about a third of Costco’s gains. Placer.ai data found that Target overall foot traffic dropped 9% in February and 6.5% in March; and it appears to be continuing to fall. A Forbes report citing data from analytics firm Similarweb found that a February 28 “economic blackout” aimed at boycotting major retailers and consumer companies that have signaled less commitment to DEI caused Target’s web traffic to drop a reported 9%—with Costco’s rising 22%. A group of Black faith leaders even called for a Target shopping “fast” for the entirety of Lent. (Target, which did not respond to an inquiry from Fast Company, has been muted in its response; it has pointed to fourth quarter 2024 results claiming a slight uptick in online and foot traffic, and has emphasized ongoing efforts to foster “inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.”) While Walmart has also been a boycott target, these reports have so far found that there’s been less impact on Walmart from its own plans to scale back DEI efforts, and that may be because it never experienced a social-values halo. Walmart, instead, has always aligned its brand strictly with low prices. Similarly, Amazon’s price-and-convenience identity doesn’t seem to have suffered from its own DEI pullback. So perhaps it’s not that Target is less progressive than those rivals, but that it was perceived, by design, as having promised to do more. It’s also now been hit from both sides: first, criticized by the anti-diversity crowd for its Pride-friendly merch and now, by shoppers who perceive it as having backed down. There’s certainly anecdotal evidence to back the idea that Costco has benefitted from embracing DEI while others have backed off. In one Reddit thread on the subject, a veteran Costco shopper reports “the lines for new member sign-up were 10-15 people deep. I’ve never seen more than 2 or 3 people signing up at a time.” Another agrees—and proceeds to complain about the resulting paucity of parking spaces, and to suggest that Costco up its membership fee. As for Target, while it might be seen as backtracking on diversity, it’s sticking with other elements of its established brand, like those designer team-ups. A line of Kate Spade clothing, bags, and accessories for Target “drops” this weekend, aiming squarely at the chain’s stylish bargain sweet spot. It could prove a test of some shoppers’ boycott commitment. Costco hasn’t hinted at any plans to match that strategy, but it has cultivated its reputation for offering comparative bargains on luxe goods including “Rolex watches, Dom Pérignon, 10-carat diamonds,” as the company’s board chair recently said. But even this is positioned as an extension of Costco’s longstanding find-a-deal “treasure hunt” image, with discount prices at its core. With tariffmageddon looming over the American shopping scene—and causing Walmart and other retailers to gird themselves for uncertainty—that’s the brand attribute that’s likely to mean the most to Costco and its shoppers. And if a reputation for sticking to its principles gets thrown in too, well, that’s an even better bargain.",

        "description": "I shop at Costco about once a month now that I live in a house in California instead of an apartment in New York City. Julia Gilban-CohenI grew up in tiny NYC apartments, so the thought of shopping at Costco was a distant luxury.However, my partner and I recently moved into a house in Los Angeles and now love it there.We get gas, protein bars, batteries, frozen fruit, and more at Costco each month. I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk.However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items.Here are my favorite things to get there. Gas is always at the top of our shopping list.I probably fill my car up about once a week at Costco.Julia Gilban-CohenWe tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes.The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day.We often buy a five-pack of steaks to use for dinners throughout the week. We eat a lot of Kirkland Signature steak.Julia Gilban-CohenMy partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on the grill or in a cast-iron pan and are often the star of a delicious weekday meal for us. Ribs are also a must-buy.We can get a huge rack of ribs at Costco.Julia Gilban-CohenWe never skip out on buying Costco's ribs, especially since we can get over 9 pounds of meat for about $35. The store also stocks pre-seasoned ribs, which are great when we're out of our homemade dry rub. We'll make these for ourselves or when having friends over for a barbecue.Greek yogurt is a versatile staple.I'm a fan of the Kirkland brand of Greek yogurt.Julia Gilban-CohenI'm a huge fan of Kirkland Signature products, and I especially like the label's organic Greek yogurt. It's perfect for making smoothies creamy or adding protein to granola. I have plenty of room in my freezer for frozen fruit.On one trip, I got 4 pounds of strawberries for $10.Julia Gilban-CohenNow that I live in a house, I have room in my freezer to buy staples in bulk, like frozen strawberries.I'm usually pretty happy with the prices of frozen fruit at Costco, so I pick up mixed berries or strawberries there. Recently, I got 4 pounds of Kirkland Signature organic strawberries for $10, which felt like a steal compared to prices I've seen at other local grocery stores.Kirkland Signature paper towels feel like a steal.I buy big bulk packs of paper towels at Costco now that I have storage space.Julia Gilban-CohenAgain, now that I have the space, I'm able to buy more household staples in bulk. We often pick up big packs of the Kirkland Signature paper towels and store them in our shed to optimize kitchen space.These affordable paper towels are thick and powerful. One 12-pack of rolls often lasts us over two months, especially since we supplement the use of them with microfiber cloths. I also get my batteries in bulk.Kirkland Signature has batteries.Julia Gilban-CohenSince we live in a house with a ton of random gadgets, we somehow always need batteries. I try to keep a few varieties on hand. Fortunately, we've found Kirkland Signature batteries to be fairly affordable and easy to buy in bulk. They especially came in handy during the recent California wildfires, when we lost power and needed to use flashlights. I'm so glad we've found sugar-free Liquid IV.I can't find the sugar-free version of Liquid IV at most stores near me.Julia Gilban-CohenWorking from home, I get distracted and find myself not hydrating frequently or as much as I should. So, I like that I can use Liquid IV to boost the flavor and hydration power of my water with electrolytes and sugar-free flavoring.I'm usually not able to find sugar-free Liquid IV at my local grocery stores, but Costco always seems to have some packs in stock.We go through a lot of Kirkland Signature protein bars.I usually eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day.Julia Gilban-CohenMy partner and I typically each eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day. I don't eat too much meat, so these bars help me easily get 21 grams of protein when I need a boost. We usually buy the variety pack with 10 cookie-dough and 10 brownie bars. My partner likes the cookie-dough flavor, and I prefer the brownie one — a match made in heaven.Dates are always in my cart.I love dates.Julia Gilban-CohenI'm a huge date girl. Dates really are nature's candy.I love eating them raw on their own, making date bark with some peanut butter and chocolate chips, or incorporating them into a smoothie or yogurt bowl. They're a great source of fiber, potassium, and magnesium too.Costco has some of the best deals on vanilla extract I've seen.I like buying big bottles of vanilla extract.Julia Gilban-CohenI love baking, but quality vanilla extract is a key ingredient in many recipes that can be expensive and hard to find in larger quantities. At Costco, however, I can find 16 ounces of pure vanilla extract for under $12. To me, that's an amazing deal. Nothing beats the Kirkland Signature three-pack of honey's flavor and price. I've been happy with the quality of Kirkland Signature honey. Julia Gilban-CohenKirkland Signature honey is one of our pantry staples since I'm a huge tea fan and love adding it to my drinks. I also recently got my partner into peppermint tea, which can be enhanced with a dollop of honey. This honey tastes high-quality — and getting three 24-ounce bottles of it for under $13 feels like a bargain. Costco sells my favorite pimple patches.My Costco sells Hero Mighty Patches.Julia Gilban-CohenYes, I still struggle with acne in my late 20s. I really like the pimple patches from Hero because they can hardly be seen when they're applied correctly.I'll often wear one or two when I'm traveling on a plane, taking a between-Zoom-meeting stroll, or even having virtual calls. The stickers help me avoid picking at my skin, and I'm a firm believer they make my pimples disappear much faster.Having bulk containers of allergy meds has been a game changer.I get bad seasonal allergies.Julia Gilban-CohenAs someone who deals with allergies, I always try to keep medication on hand that will help me deal with symptoms. Name-brand options can get pricey, especially since I take tablets every day. So, I opt for Kirkland Signature allergy medicine. The $5 bottle of 600 pills does my wallet a huge favor.Big containers of ibuprofen can come in handy, too.I stock up on ibuprofen at Costco.Julia Gilban-CohenOne of the first things we did when moving into our first place together was buy a first-aid kit. After that, we stocked up on some of our staple medications, like ibuprofen I can get big tubs of CeraVe at the bulk retailer.I love that I can grab my skincare alongside my groceries.Julia Gilban-CohenSince moving to Los Angeles, my skin has struggled to adjust to the dry climate. So, I've been buying bulk packs of the CeraVe moisturizing cream and using it morning and night. Hydrating and not greasy, the cream has been my hero as of late. Plus, it's fairly affordable at Costco at $25 for two 16-ounce tubs. I like to peruse the clothing section while I'm shopping.Some of the lounge sets at Costco are comfy and pretty affordable.Julia Gilban-CohenPerhaps one of the best things about Costco is that it's truly a one-stop shop. I always check the retailer's clothing section and often pick up a piece or two.My latest favorite purchase is the $18 two-piece lounge set from Honeydew. It's so cozy and especially great on long car or plane rides.I have to end every Costco run at the food court.Costco's hot dogs are good and cheap.Julia Gilban-CohenLastly, we end our shopping trip with celebratory Costco hot dogs, which cost just $1.50 each and come with a soft drink. Click to keep reading Costco diaries like this one.Read the original article on Business Insider I shop at Costco about once a month now that I live in a house in California instead of an apartment in New York City. Julia Gilban-CohenI grew up in tiny NYC apartments, so the thought of shopping at Costco was a distant luxury.However, my partner and I recently moved into a house in Los Angeles and now love it there.We get gas, protein bars, batteries, frozen fruit, and more at Costco each month. I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk.However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items.Here are my favorite things to get there. Gas is always at the top of our shopping list.I probably fill my car up about once a week at Costco.Julia Gilban-CohenWe tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes.The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day.We often buy a five-pack of steaks to use for dinners throughout the week. We eat a lot of Kirkland Signature steak.Julia Gilban-CohenMy partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on",

        "description": "Personal transportation company Segway, Inc. has announced a major recall of two of its scooters after dozens of reports that a critical component of the scooters could fail, leading to the injury of the rider—or possibly even death. Here’s what you need to know. What’s happened? On March 20, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a recall notice on its website announcing that Segway has initiated a recall of its popular Segway Ninebot kickscooters. The recall was initiated after the company received reports that a component in the scooters could fail, leading to the risk of a fall hazard for the rider, which could result in serious injury or even death. The faulty component is the folding mechanism on the scooters, which could fail and cause it to fold while in use. Segway says that about 220,000 units of scooters are being recalled in total. What Segway scooters are being recalled? According to the CPSC notice, the following Segway scooters are being recalled: Segway Ninebot Max G30P KickScooter Segway Ninebot Max G30LP KickScooter Segway says the Max G30LP is gray with yellow accents, and the Max G30P is black with yellow accents. The brand name “ninebot” can be found on the handlebars and on the foot of both scooters, while the model number can be found on the side of the foot deck. You can find images of the recalled scooters here. Has anyone been injured? Unfortunately, yes. According to the CSPC notice, Segway has received 68 reports of the folding mechanism failing. Out of those incidents, 20 people have reportedly been injured. Injuries include broken bones, lacerations, abrasions, and bruises. But those aren’t the only possible consequences. On the recall page on its website, Segway notes that if the mechanism folds while the scooter is in use, “serious bodily injury or death” may occur. Where were the recalled scooters sold? The recalled scooters in question were sold from January 2020 through February 2025 for a retail price of between $600 and $1,000. The scooters were sold nationwide both at online retail locations and in physical retail stores. Those retailers include: Best Buy Costco Walmart Target Sam’s Club The scooters were also sold on Amazon.com and Segway.com. What should I do if I have a recalled scooter? Immediately stop using it, says the notice on the CSPC’s website. Owners can then use this online tool on Segway’s website to determine if their scooter is affected by the recall. If it is, owners of the scooters will be eligible to request and receive one self-maintenance kit that will allow them to adjust and tighten the folding mechanism. Full details of the recall can be found here.",

        "description": "I found the Costco in Hawaii had a wide selection of local products and snacks I have not seen in other parts of the US. Tammy BarrI visited Costco in Honolulu, Hawaii, while on vacation and found myself impressed by its offerings.It has a wide selection of local products, decent gas prices, and fun beach gear and clothes.I would add Costco to my Hawaiian vacation itinerary again, even if to just refuel my rental car.Hawaii is one of my favorite vacation spots for many reasons, including its many natural attractions and beautiful beaches. However, on a recent trip to Honolulu, my husband and I found ourselves especially impressed by something else: Our Costco shopping experience.Hawaii has eight Costco warehouses across its islands and, it turns out, the store can be a good spot to pick up groceries, beach gear, and the best chocolate-covered macadamia nuts in the world.Here's what our shopping trip was like and why a Costco visit was a highlight of my Hawaiian vacation.Costco had all sorts of helpful merchandise to enhance our vacation.The Costco we visited in Honolulu had tons of beach equipment. Tammy BarrLike many others, we were at Hawaii to enjoy its beautiful beaches. However, we didn't have room in our luggage to pack accessories like boogie boards, beach chairs, or umbrellas. Fortunately, Costco had many aisles of all sorts of accessories and gear — and the prices seemed pretty decent. It was also great to purchase some essentials early so I could use them throughout my trip instead of racking up rental fees or buying items from pricier boutiques.The clothing selection felt perfect for the weather, too. There was almost a whole display of swimsuits. Tammy BarrThis Costco location's clothing selection felt perfectly suited for the local weather and styles.I found tons of island-inspired shirts, tropical-print dresses, bathing suits, and colorful sarongs at decent prices. Many garments were under $10. I'd definitely come here if my luggage got lost. The Spam shirts caught my eye. Tammy BarrOne of my favorite displays was of $8 Spam-branded T-shirts. The canned ham is a really popular food in Hawaii that many locals love.The wide selection of affordable clothes makes Costco a decent spot for travelers who lost their luggage, under-packed, or forgot some outfit staples. The store reminded me how much a Costco's offerings can vary by region. Many snacks I found were from local brands.Tammy BarrI was also delighted to see this Costco had groceries that reflect the local demographics and cuisine of Hawaii. For example, the state has a large Asian population — and this Costco had an impressive array of Asian-inspired snacks, condiments, and sauces.It had a decent selection of groceries from brands local to Hawaii. Coffee from Hawaii is a delicacy, so be prepared for higher price tags.Tammy BarrI was impressed by the amount of local products on the shelves, from coffee roasted in Hawaii to pineapples harvested in Maui.There were countless displays of bulk packs of snacks and staples from local brands and candy companies, from Island Princess to Kauaui Coffee. I saw exciting offerings I'd never seen at Costco stores in the mainland US.I can't get fresh poke at Costco back on the mainland US.Tammy BarrWhile visiting Hawaii, I prefer to eat fresh fish and spicy poke bowls loaded with tuna. Fortunately, there seemed to be plenty of both on offer here.I often ate at local spots, but I liked having options if I wanted to grab something to go or to prepare myself. Although some Costco locations on the mainland sell things like tuna steaks (and even poke bowls), I was especially impressed by the quality of the seafood I found here.The beverage selection included options from several of the nearby islands.The Costco in Honolulu had an impressive beverage selection. Tammy BarrNot all Costco locations sell alcohol, but this one had a huge selection of spirits, wine, craft beer, and more.I was able to find a number of Hawaii's locally produced rums, vodkas, and cocktail mixes. It was exciting to see offerings I haven't seen back home before, like mixes from the Hawaiian brand Kōloa, and hard seltzers flavored with popular local fruits, like lilikoi. The store seemed like a great place to pick up tasty souvenirs to bring home. Costco had a macadamia-nut option for just about everyone.Tammy BarrI'd stop here to grab souvenir snacks for a lot of people (or to bring treats home for ourselves). After all, buying in bulk can be cost-effective.One good pick might be macadamia nuts, which Hawaii is a huge producer of. This location had more varieties of them than I ever thought possible — plain, roasted, salted, and chocolate-covered varieties, plus some mixed with popcorn. The dark-chocolate-covered Alohamacs macadamia nuts were my favorite.The food court still had the $1.50 hot dog deal.I still paid just $1.50 for a famous hot-dog combo. Tammy BarrMany foods cost more in Hawaii, but I was glad to still find Costco's famous $1.50 hot dog and drink combo here. Unfortunately, unlike other Costco locations I've visited in the US, this location didn't have convenient ordering kiosks. Instead, I waited in a fairly long line to place my food order. The food-court seating area was outdoors.There weren't as many tables and chairs as I expected at the food court. Tammy BarrSince this Costco is in a mild tropical environment, I'd hoped the food court would be a pleasant outdoor terrace.The dining area is outdoors, but it was more like a sparsely filled walkway next to the parking lot with a limited number of tables. Even so, it was nice to enjoy our hot dogs and drinks in the fresh air. Of course, we fueled up at Costco before we left. We made sure to get gas at Costco, too. Tammy BarrWe used a rental car throughout our trip and quickly realized just how expensive gas can be in Hawaii.Fortunately, like in the contiguous US, many Costco locations here have a gas station with prices we found to be far less than the competition. So, I came to Costco to economically fuel my rental car at the beginning and end of my Hawaii trip.If you're a Costco member visiting Hawaii, consider stopping by the chain. It was interesting to walk through a Costco in a new place. Tammy BarrFor us, a visit to Costco during our Hawaii vacation felt like a fruitful endeavor. Even though we didn't buy a ton of bulk groceries, we enjoyed looking through the aisles to see what's popular and available in a new place. I was extra impressed by the variety and amount of Hawaiian-produced snacks and other locally produced goods. Plus, venturing around air-conditioned store was a pleasant break from the heat.Costco is likely to be my first and last stop on future trips to the Aloha State — especially if I have a rental car and need fuel. Read the original article on Business Insider I found the Costco in Hawaii had a wide selection of local products and snacks I have not seen in other parts of the US. Tammy BarrI visited Costco in Honolulu, Hawaii, while on vacation and found myself impressed by its offerings.It has a wide selection of local products, decent gas prices, and fun beach gear and clothes.I would add Costco to my Hawaiian vacation itinerary again, even if to just refuel my rental car.Hawaii is one of my favorite vacation spots for many reasons, including its many natural attractions and beautiful beaches. However, on a recent trip to Honolulu, my husband and I found ourselves especially impressed by something else: Our Costco shopping experience.Hawaii has eight Costco warehouses across its islands and, it turns out, the store can be a good spot to pick up groceries, beach gear, and the best chocolate-covered macadamia nuts in the world.Here's what our shopping trip was like and why a Costco visit was a highlight of my Hawaiian vacation.Costco had all sorts of helpful merchandise to enhance our vacation.The Costco we visited in Honolulu had tons of beach equipment. Tammy BarrLike many others, we were at Hawaii to enjoy its beautiful beaches. However, we didn't have room in our luggage to pack accessories like boogie boards, beach chairs, or umbrellas. Fortunately, Costco had many aisles of all sorts of accessories and gear — and the prices seemed pretty decent. It was also great to purchase some essentials early so I could use them throughout my trip instead of racking up rental fees or buying items from pricier boutiques.The clothing selection felt perfect for the weather, too. There was almost a whole display of swimsuits. Tammy BarrThis Costco location's clothing selection felt perfectly suited for the local weather and styles.I found tons of island-inspired shirts, tropical-print dresses, bathing suits, and colorful sarongs at decent prices. Many garments were under $10. I'd definitely come here if my luggage got lost. The Spam shirts caught my eye. Tammy BarrOne of my favorite displays was of $8 Spam-branded T-shirts. The canned ham is a really popular food in Hawaii that many locals love.The wide selection of affordable clothes makes Costco a decent spot for travelers who lost their luggage, under-packed, or forgot some outfit staples. The store reminded me how much a Costco's offerings can vary by region. Many snacks I found were from local brands.Tammy BarrI was also delighted to see this Costco had groceries that reflect the local demographics and cuisine of Hawaii. For example, the state has a large Asian population — and this Costco had an impressive array of Asian-inspired snacks, condiments, and sauces.It had a decent selection of groceries from brands local to Hawaii. Coffee from Hawaii is a delicacy, so be prepared for higher price tags.Tammy BarrI was impressed by the amount of local products on the shelves, from coffee roasted in Hawaii to pineapples harvested in Maui.There were countless displays of bulk packs of snacks and staples from local brands and candy companies, from Island Princess to Kauaui Coffee.

        "description": "I tasted and reviewed chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods to find the best option for a quick lunch. After trying four different options, I found the best chicken salad to buy at the grocery store.Ted BergI tried chicken salad from Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods.The Wegmans option was pretty expensive and didn't have a ton of flavor.However, I enjoyed the Whole Foods chicken salad, which was scooped fresh at the deli counter.I never enjoyed chicken salad until I started working at a deli in my early 20s. It quickly became a lunch staple for me, even though I had so many other sandwich options at my fingertips.Nowadays, I usually get my chicken salad fix at home when I have leftover grilled or rotisserie chicken. However, I wanted to see if I could find something worthwhile at the supermarket to enter my lunch rotation.So, I visited four major supermarket chains — Costco, Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and Whole Foods — and bought premade chicken salad at each one.I taste-tested all four with some crackers and ranked them from worst to first. Here's how they stacked up.I wouldn't buy the Wegmans grilled chicken salad again.I didn't think the Wegmans chicken salad had a ton of flavor.Ted BergWhen I visited Wegmans, a 16-ounce tub of grilled chicken salad cost $15. Since that price seemed borderline outrageous, I hoped the chicken salad would be delicious.However, I was disappointed. There wasn't much flavor to it at all — the prevailing taste was that of mayonnaise — and it had an oddly grainy texture that closely resembled tuna salad.There was a good amount of chicken in the mix, which might help explain the price, but the meat lacked flavor and wasn't especially moist. The price point, more than the chicken salad itself, earned Wegmans the bottom spot on my ranking.Trader Joe's Wine Country chicken salad was too sweet for me.Trader Joe's Wine Country chicken salad had sweetened dried cranberries and pecans.Ted BergAcross multiple visits to three separate Trader Joe's in my area, the closest option I found to the others on this list was the Wine Country chicken salad. However, it differed slightly from the others as it incorporated sweetened dried cranberries and pecans.At first, I thought that might give it an unfair advantage in the ranking, since I normally enjoy a chicken salad with dried cranberries. The $5 price also seemed like a good deal for a 12-ounce container.However, this chicken salad was way too sweet for my taste and not quite hearty enough. It seemed like there was a lot more goopy liquid than chunks of chicken, and the cranberries tasted like candy.Overall, I thought this tasted more like a salad dressing than a deli salad.Costco's chicken salad was just OK.The Kirkland Signature chicken salad was greasy. Ted BergI found the Kirkland Signature chicken salad in Costco's prepared foods section. It was priced at $6 a pound, making it the least-expensive option I tried on a per-pound basis. The container I picked up contained about 2 pounds of chicken salad.The salad had the biggest chunks of chicken of any I tried by far, but it practically shimmered with grease.I also thought it was bland in terms of flavor. However, since I was already familiar with the Kirkland Signature rotisserie chicken, the briny, brothy flavor of the meat was easy to pick out.There was celery in the mix, but it added more flavor than texture; ideally, I'd prefer that reversed.The chicken salad was fine but not especially good, and it's hard to imagine a situation in which I'd want two pounds of it. I'd buy the Whole Foods classic chicken salad again.The chicken salad from Whole Foods was scooped fresh at the deli counter.Ted BergOf the four chicken salads I tried, the version from Whole Foods was the only one that was scooped fresh at a deli counter. It was also the only one I'd consider buying again.At $14 per pound, it was significantly more expensive than the chicken salads from Costco and Trader Joe's but slightly less expensive than the one from Wegmans. I appreciated that I could order only as much as I needed — a half-pound, in this case.It was easily the best-tasting of the four salads I tried. The chicken, chopped up into bite-sized pieces, was moist and tasted fresh. Although hardly bold in flavor, the salad was nuanced with the earthy sweetness of red onions, notes of rosemary, and a touch of mustardy bite.Unlike the others, it tasted better than anything I could easily make at home.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Both warehouse chains are unsurprisingly popular in the suburbs, but Sam's Club is more popular among rural households and Costco has more strength with city dwellers.Dominick Reuter/BI (Sam's Club); Gene Puskar/AP (Costco)On the surface, Costco and Sam's Club have a lot of similarities.A deeper look reveals some notable differences between the two brands' customer profiles.For example, Numerator data indicates wealthy urban shoppers are more likely to be members of Costco than Sam's Club.On the surface, Costco and Sam's Club have a lot of similarities.Both are sprawling warehouses stocked with palletized displays of bulk goods at bargain prices. Both charge an annual membership fee to access the deals. Both were directly inspired by the visionary entrepreneur Sol Price's original club stores.However, digging a little deeper into consumer data reveals some notable differences between the two brands' customer profiles.For starters, the typical Costco shopper spends nearly twice as much a year and visits more than 50% more frequently than Sam's Club members do, according to 2024 data from consumer analytics firm Numerator.The typical Costco shopper visits about 32 times a year and spends a total of $3,086, while the typical Sam's Club shopper makes 20 trips and spends $1,583 in a year, according to Numerator.As part of their overall retail budget, Costco shoppers spend roughly one in eight of their dollars at warehouse stores, which is almost 65% higher than the overall US average.That wallet share is a bit lower for the typical Sam's Club member, who spends about one in 12 of their dollars at wholesale clubs — still higher than the US average by about 13%.Costco shoppers also tend to be wealthier — earning more than $125,000 household income on average — while Sam's Club shoppers tend to have more mid-range incomes of between $40,000 and $125,000. Even so, Sam's Club members are slightly more likely to be homeowners than Costco members, Numerator finds.And while both chains are unsurprisingly popular in the suburbs, Sam's Club is more popular among rural households and Costco has more strength with city dwellers, according to Numerator.The data indicates that both chains tend to be equally popular among shoppers who identify as white. Walmart-owned Sam's Club is slightly favored by shoppers who identify as Black or Hispanic/Latino.Meanwhile, Costco is exceptionally popular among Asian-identifying households, who are nearly twice as likely to shop there as at a typical retail brand.Costco shoppers are also much more interested in organic foods than their Sam's Club counterparts.In terms of age, Sam's Club shoppers skew slightly older than Costco shoppers, though Gen X shoppers are equal fans of both.Kantar retail analyst Gina Logan told Business Insider that Gen Z and Alpha shoppers are increasingly seeing the appeal of the club store model, which could bring down the average customer age at both chains.And 2024 was a big year for Sam's Club that saw the rollout of new AI-powered checkout technology and the grand opening of its first new store in seven years.Sam's Club also managed to snatch the top ranking for customer satisfaction in retail from longtime winner Costco earlier this year.Lastly, both chains are seeing a strong start to 2025, with visits up more than 7% from last year — double the increases for Walmart and Target — according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.Numerator's data indicates nearly half of American households shop at either Costco or Sam's Club at least once in the past year, underscoring that US shoppers love finding a good deal.Read the original article on Business Insider Both warehouse chains are unsurprisingly popular in the suburbs, but Sam's Club is more popular among rural households and Costco has more strength with city dwellers.Dominick Reuter/BI (Sam's Club); Gene Puskar/AP (Costco)On the surface, Costco and Sam's Club have a lot of similarities.A deeper look reveals some notable differences between the two brands' customer profiles.For example, Numerator data indicates wealthy urban shoppers are more likely to be members of Costco than Sam's Club.On the surface, Costco and Sam's Club have a lot of similarities.Both are sprawling warehouses stocked with palletized displays of bulk goods at bargain prices.

Walmart-owned Sam's Club is slightly favored by shoppers who identify as Black or Hispanic/Latino.Meanwhile, Costco is exceptionally popular among Asian-identifying households, who are nearly twice as likely to shop there as at a typical retail brand.Costco shoppers are also much more interested in organic foods than their Sam's Club counterparts.In terms of age, Sam's Club shoppers skew slightly older than Costco shoppers, though Gen X shoppers are equal fans of both.Kantar retail analyst Gina Logan told Business Insider that Gen Z and Alpha shoppers are increasingly seeing the appeal of the club store model, which could bring down the average customer age at both chains.And 2024 was a big year for Sam's Club that saw the rollout of new AI-powered checkout technology and the grand opening of its first new store in seven years.Sam's Club also managed to snatch the top ranking for customer satisfaction in retail from longtime winner Costco earlier this year.Lastly, both chains are seeing a strong start to 2025, with visits up more than 7% from last year — double the increases for Walmart and Target — according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.Numerator's data indicates nearly half of American households shop at either Costco or Sam's Club at least once in the past year, underscoring that US shoppers love finding a good deal.Read the original article on Business Insider",

By contrast, Costco saw nearly 7.7 million more visits during the same period.Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.While Numerator said the changes \"may be linked\" to the companies' respective DEI stances, a number of other factors, such as persistently high consumer prices and the availability of eggs, may have contributed to the shifting market share between the two retailers.Still, the shifts were most pronounced among Black and Hispanic/Latino households — and especially during the first week of February. In particular, Numerator said that Hispanic or Latino households drove more than a third of Costco's gains, nearly twice the rate that would be expected based on demographic representation alone.Meanwhile, Walmart — which never made DEI a big part of its brand identity — saw relatively consistent performance during the same four-week window, even though it scaled back some of its DEI efforts late last year.Additionally, Numerator found that frequent Walmart shoppers are generally less concerned with DEI and social justice issues than frequent Target shoppers.The numbers suggest that being known for one position and then changing course could push some customers away.\"That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble,\" Collage Group's chief insights officer, David Albert, recently told Business Insider.\"We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say and they don't say what they do,\" Albert said.Read the original article on Business Insider Costco and Target have long made corporate social responsibility a big part of their brand identities, but they have recently handled their DEI policies differently.Talia Lakritz/BI (Costco); Paul Weaver/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images (Target)Target and Costco have responded in different ways to the changing politics around DEI.A recent survey indicates some customer foot traffic and market share has shifted from Target to Costco.Meanwhile Walmart — which hasn't made DEI a big part of its brand — has performed consistently.The backlash to the backlash over DEI is starting to show up at Target and Costco.While both retailers have long made so-called corporate social responsibility a big part of their brand identities, they responded in remarkably different ways regarding DEI policies in the face of a second Donald Trump presidency.In January, Target said it was scrapping some of its DEI-related programs, while Costco's shareholders successfully defended theirs against an activist shareholder proposal.Now, a new survey from consumer analytics firm Numerator finds customer foot traffic and market share have shifted from Target to Costco, particularly among shoppers who say DEI is important.In terms of year-over-year visits, the firm said Target has seen nearly 5 million fewer shopping trips during the four weeks ending on February 9.

Air fryers help me prepare meals quickly and conveniently, making my food nice and crispy while using far less oil than deep-frying.It's one of my favorite appliances to use while running my blog Costco Kitchen, where I share creative meal and recipe ideas using products from the warehouse store.Here are some of my favorite Costco buys to prepare in an air fryer.I often cook my Kirkland Signature chicken wings in the air fryerCostco sells party wings in bulk.Quierra LuckKirkland Signature chicken wings come out of the air fryer tender and juicy.They can be ready to eat in under 30 minutes, making them a perfect party snack or a quick weeknight dinner. Marinade them before air-frying or toss them with a wing sauce before serving. Pair them with a starchy side dish and salad or steamed vegetables for an easy, no-fuss family meal.Making green beans in the air fryer is super simpleCooking green beans is usually a multistep process that involves boiling, dunking them in an ice bath, and then cooking them in a hot pan.With an air fryer, they can be ready in less than 10 minutes with no additional bowls, pots, or pans to clean.The green beans I buy from Costco come snipped, washed, and ready to use, so I can simply toss them in olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook them in the air fryer for eight minutes. Use your air fryer to help make a delicious garlic spreadIf you love garlic, try roasting an entire bulb in the air fryer. The garlic bulbs turn soft, golden, and slightly sweet and nutty in flavor.I like to get a 2-pound bag of California-grown fresh garlic at Costco. I cut off the tops of the bulbs, drizzle them with olive oil, then roast them in the air fryer for 35 minutes.You can mix the garlic with softened butter to make a heavenly garlic paste to spread over toast.I make my own crispy and satisfying toasted ravioli Giovanni Rana ravioli and marinara sauce is a quick and easy appetizer.Keith Homan/ShutterstockYou may have seen deep-fried ravioli, often referred to as \"toasted ravioli,\" in the appetizer section of restaurant menus.I like to use the Giovanni Rana 3 Cheese Ravioli from Costco to make a similar version in the air fryer. Boil the ravioli for three minutes, then dip them in an egg mixture and dredge in panko breadcrumbs. Spray both sides with oil so the ravioli can get nice and crispy, then air fry for eight to 10 minutes. I like to serve them with Rao's Homemade marinara sauce, which can be found in the pasta section at Costco.Chicken drumsticks can be the star of a weeknight dinner that's ready in half an hourFor some dinners, I buy Kirkland Signature organic chicken drumsticks that come in portion packs containing about five or six pieces. To prep them, I coat the drumsticks (be sure to thaw beforehand if using frozen) with my favorite seasonings and pop them in the air fryer for an easy weeknight dinner that's ready in under 30 minutes.I brush them with melted butter and parsley when they come out of the air fryer to give them a rich and glossy finish.If you didn't like tofu before, try making it crispy in the air fryerIf you've eaten tofu in the past but didn't love it, I suggest air-frying it.I use Nasoya Organic firm tofu, which I get from Costco. It's important to use firm tofu when air-frying to ensure it can hold up throughout the cooking process. I like to marinate the tofu cubes with Kinder's Teriyaki Sauce — also from Costco — before placing them in the air fryer for 18 minutes. The crispy tofu can be enjoyed by itself or added to stir-fry. My favorite way to enjoy air-fried tofu is in a bowl with rice, quinoa, vegetables, and sauce to make a perfect dish for meatless Mondays.Just Bare chicken-breast chunks are a great dupe for another popular nuggetJust Bare chicken-breast chunks turn out nice and crisp in the air fryer.Kristen CarliSome know Just Bare chicken-breast chunks as being a dupe for Chick-fil-A's nuggets.Heat them in the air fryer at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for eight minutes to get the breading on the outside nice and crispy while the meat stays tender and juicy. You can sprinkle them over a salad, add them to a tortilla for a crunchy chicken wrap, or enjoy them with dipping sauces.Potstickers stay soft with a golden, crispy exterior Costco carries a variety of frozen potstickers and dumplings, many of which come with a dipping sauce.Preparing them in the air fryer is my preferred method so they get crispy edges and a soft bottom.If you want your potstickers golden and crispy all around, flip them halfway during the cooking process.Vegetable-filled spring rolls are a great snack when you air-fry them Heating these spring rolls in the air fryer makes them nice and crispy.Olivia YiThe vegetable spring rolls from Royal Asia are the perfect appetizer or snack because you can heat them up in the air fryer and dip them in the soy-ginger sauce that's provided.

        "description": "Shares of Costco (COST) fell over 7% in midday trading on Friday after the wholesale retailer reported mixed second-quarter earnings results, missing profit estimates but beating on revenue, as the company braces for the impact of tariffs and inflation on consumer spending. “The tariffs are very fluid right now, so it’s hard to give any predictions about what we can do, but our people are well equipped to deal with anything coming our way and we have great partnerships with our suppliers,” CEO Ron Vachris said during the company’s earnings call. “Our people are nimble and ready to go.” Costco’s Q2 revenue came in at $63.72 billion, slightly beating analyst estimates for $63.11 billion. Meanwhile, same-store sales jumped slightly from 6.38% to 6.8%, beating forecasts for an increase of 6.4%, and e-commerce came in at an increase of 20.9%. However, adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.02, missing estimates of $4.11. And while overall same-store sales were up, the company missed estimates in Canada and other international markets. One advantage Costco has over some other retailers is its popular membership, whose fees make up more than 70% of its operating profits. Costco raised those fees last year for the first time since 2017; a basic Gold Star individual membership now costs $65, while an Executive membership is $120 to $130. Another good sign: Costco announced it expects to open 12 new stores across the nation in 2025, including seven locations this spring in March and April. Here’s a list of those seven locations: Brentwood, CA Genesee County, MI Highland, CA Prosper, TX Sharon, MA Weatherford, TX Stuart, FL In addition, Vachris said the company plans to open two locations in Canada and four other international locations in the coming six months. According to Costco’s website, two of those international stores will be in Minami Alps, Japan and Ardeer, Australia. Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, with a majority of those in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (617). Other locations include Canada (109), Mexico (41), Japan (36 ), UK (29), Korea (19), Australia (15), Taiwan (14), China (7), Spain (5), France (2), and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden.",

As the Trump administration rolls out — and rescinds — tariffs on Canada and Mexico, investors were anxious to learn how the policy would impact Costco. The company’s reliance on membership fees for more than 70% of its operating profits gives it an advantage over competitors in an inflationary environment. “The tariffs are very fluid right now, so it’s hard to give any predictions about what we can do, but our people are well equipped to deal with anything coming our way and we have great partnerships with our suppliers,” CEO Ron Vachris told analysts Thursday (March 6) during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “Our people are nimble and ready to go.” Recent PYMNTS data reveals 72% of consumers expect higher prices, 66% expect product shortages due to the potential tariffs and 53% expect higher support for local businesses. Additionally, the data shows many consumers admit to not being sure about the impacts of tariffs on issues beyond higher prices.

We’re also seeing some indications members are spending more on food at home than food away from home.” As a result, Costco’s second-quarter net sales rose 9.1% to $62.53 billion, while net sales for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2025 increased 8.3% to $123.52 billion. Second-quarter comparable sales grew 6.8%, including 8.3% in the U.S. and 4.6% in Canada, and eCommerce sales rose 20.9%. Overall comp sales for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2025 grew 6% while eCommerce sales rose 17.1%. Meanwhile, February sales rose 8.8% to $19.81 billion. Costco — which raised its membership fees last year for the first time since 2017, to $65 from $60 for basic memberships and from $120 to $130 for Executive plans — reported a 7.4% increase in membership income, with renewal rates of 90.5% worldwide and 93.0% in the U.S. and Canada. Paid memberships rose 6.8% to 78.4 million, while total cardholders grew 6.6% to 140.6 million. Executive memberships comprised 36.9 million cardholders and represent 73.8% of worldwide sales. Top sales categories were gold and jewelry, home furnishings, small electrics, hardware, sporting goods, housewares and toys. Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 109 in Canada. Vachris said the company plans to open 28 new stores by the end of fiscal 2025. See also: PYMNTS’ Shopping Apps Ranking Reveals Best in Personalized Customer Experiences Positive Digital Metrics Digital metrics also showed significant gains, with site traffic up 13%, a 10% increase in average order value and a 19% increase in Costco logistics deliveries, Millerchip noted, adding there have been 43 million visits to the new warehouse tool on the app. “We continue to make progress with our digital tech road map,” Millerchip added. He also noted that a new digital multi-vendor mailer is having an impact on member engagement. “It helps us be more targeted with our members,” he added. “We started it last month, and there’s more to come on that front.” The post Costco Leans Into Memberships Amid Tariff Uncertainty appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",
