Date: 2025-06-04 23:01:02
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: A deceleration in comparable sales growth, even if still positive at 6.0%, can trigger a negative reaction in the short term as traders focus on the slowdown.

This surprise factor is likely to lead to immediate selling pressure.
```

Title: Costco’s monthly sales growth continues to ease
Date: 2025-06-04 22:34:00
Sentiment: negative
Explanation: The title "Costco's monthly sales growth continues to ease" immediately suggests negative momentum. While the 6.8% sales gain is positive overall, the "easing" indicates a slowdown, likely triggering short-term selling pressure as traders react to the decelerating growth. This falls into the category of quantifiable data missing expectations (or at least trending downward), thus justifying a negative classification for the next 60 minutes.

Without specific details about the content of the podcast segment about Costco, it's impossible to determine if it contains any information that would have a significant positive or negative impact on the stock price within the next 60 minutes.

Date: 2025-05-30 18:55:50
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The title indicates a review of analyst opinions *after* earnings.

Date: 2025-05-29 18:47:45

Date: 2025-05-29 13:00:00
Sentiment: neutral
Explanation: The news focuses on earnings being reported after the bell, which means no immediate impact within the 60-minute window following the news release.

Date: 2025-05-27 20:46:00
