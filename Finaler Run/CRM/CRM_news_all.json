        "description": "Take a quick look around the office or scan the names of your colleagues on Slack. Two-thirds of your coworkers are feeling burned out. Maybe you are, too. In a survey conducted for Moodle, an e-learning tool, 66% of workers are struggling, citing too much work, not enough resources, and a poor economy. While all these circumstances have a role in burnout, there may be an internal problem also in play, according to Jeffrey Hull and Margaret Moore, coauthors of The Science of Leadership: Nine Ways to Expand Your Impact. Your ego could be too noisy! “A noisy ego describes a person who is constantly thinking about themselves,” Moore says. “They’re asking ‘Am I OK?’ ‘Are they insulting me?’ ‘Am I being positioned correctly?’ It’s a self-referencing, self-oriented noise.” A quiet ego is a term coined by Jack Bauer, a professor of psychology at the University of Dayton, and Heidi Wayment, a professor of psychological sciences at Northern Arizona University. It describes a personality type characterized by being mindful, emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and growth-oriented. “The quiet ego is an evolved person who’s integrated all the noise,” Moore explains. “They’ve been through life. It’s where stress turns into growth; the next stage beyond emotional intelligence of self-awareness and self-regulation.” Why We Shift into the Noisy Ego The noisy ego often gets triggered during a loss of vitality. Perhaps you’re not getting enough sleep or you’re not eating well. “This is a really important transitional moment when the ego could get really noisy and make things difficult,” Hull says. “Your battery is basically drained, and there’s no energy left,” Moore adds. “[Your prefrontal cortex goes offline], and you’ve lost your ability to control things. You can’t blame the individual for all of it. It’s an equal balance of external factors and internal factors, and you can’t get out by yourself.” Being in a crisis can trigger the noisy ego since it pushes you out of the familiar and into reaction mode. It can also stir up emotions that are uncomfortable to handle. You can easily slip into feeling out of control—anxious, afraid, and hopeless. It’s also common to not ask for enough support, believing you can power through. But this can quickly become a place with a lot of negativity and too little positivity, Moore says. Shifting Back into the Quiet Ego Getting yourself out of your noisy ego involves positive psychology. “How do you find gratitude and inspiration?” Moore asks. “How do you get a little bit of upward lift—by socializing or taking a break? You build those positive resources, but you also have to resolve the negative with a friend, a coach, or by journaling.” A good place to start is investigating the noise. When you’re coming from a place of fear, the main negatives are worry, anxiety, sadness, disappointment, and anger. “Look at each of those,” Moore says. “If you’re angry, what are the emotions telling you that you need more? Do you need more safety or stability? Then, how do you meet the needs of those parts of you?” Curiosity is a superpower, but it isn’t accessible with a noisy ego. You need to quiet that energy to be more open and receptive. When you notice symptoms of burnout, Hull recommends reflecting on a time when things were working. “What did it look like?” he asks. “Very successful people wouldn’t be in positions of success if they had always been burned out. They had to come from a place of having done well. But that noisy ego gets in the way, and they forget the gifts and talents and strengths that got them to that place of success.” Hull recommends reflecting on a resource called the resourceful past. “What got you through college? What got you your first job? Or try to remember a time that was really difficult. What did you do to get through that?” he asks. “Those capacities are still there.” The Quiet Ego Is Your Natural State It’s easy to forget what it feels like to have a quiet ego because we live in an overstimulated world. We become so caught up in the noise that we no longer recognize it, seeing it as normal. But the quiet ego is our natural and normal state, Moore says. “Start noticing your heartbeat and your breathing,” she suggests. “It is a place of quiet.” Think about a time when you exhaled and felt calm and in control. This place is a state of stillness, and it can become a refuge you visit when you want to regain control of your mind, Hull says. “The challenge we have in our culture is that we’ve made [stillness] wrong. We think we don’t have time for that, that it’s wasteful. But when you get calmer, you start to explore because your ego is not in the way. “It’s not about having no ego,” he adds. “It’s setting aside the noise. It’s the process of becoming awake to yourself—physically, emotionally, and mentally. Your energy shifts to a calmer place. And from that calmer place, you can access creativity, ideas, and curiosity.”",

        "description": "“Capitalism as we know it is dead.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff made that proclamation at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in 2019. “We’re going to see a new kind of capitalism,” he went on. “If your orientation is just about making money, I don’t think you’re going to hang out very long as a CEO or a founder of a company.” Benioff’s remarks were striking, but not shocking. He was merely articulating what had become the conventional wisdom among business leaders in that moment. After decades of serving shareholders alone, CEOs were embracing the idea that they should also be concerned about stakeholders—employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, and even the planet. This notion of “business for good” had become mainstream. Silicon Valley giants like Google and Facebook rose to power while touting their commitment to transforming the world for the better. Tesla became a trillion-dollar company while talking about saving the planet. Mission-driven startups like Toms, Warby Parker, and Bombas helped reshape the way people shop, giving away one product for every one sold, while high-profile startups like Uber and Airbnb insisted that they, too, were trying to do more than make money. (Airbnb says its mission is to “create a world where anyone can belong anywhere.”) Even big, established corporations embraced the idea that, in Benioff’s words, business could be “the greatest platform for change.” They launched diversity and inclusiveness initiatives and took steps to reduce their carbon footprint, vowing to be net carbon zero by 2030. “Doing well by doing good” was no longer just a niche concept. It was here to stay. Or so it seemed. Just a few years later, it’s stakeholder capitalism—not capitalism itself—that looks dead. Right-wing activist shareholders have bullied companies like Harley-Davidson, Caterpillar, and Lowe’s into rolling back their DEI initiatives. Investors claiming that so-called environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues were fundamental to their investment choices have stopped talking about those issues entirely. CEOs who confidently issued pronouncements about social justice and the importance of fighting climate change have clammed up. When asked how he feels about this current moment, David Bronner, chief executive of natural soap purveyor Dr. Bronner’s—a 75-year-old conscious capitalism mainstay—says, “Sometimes I’m stoked and most times I’m not.” This reversal has been so fast and so dramatic that even many of the youngest mission-driven companies now look like relics of a bygone era, while the environment that spawned them feels like little more than a dream. But the movement that defined the past 15 years changed American business in meaningful ways that will survive the backlash. To understand how, and where it goes from here, it’s time to look at why it arose, what it accomplished (and failed to), why it came crashing down, and what’s left standing amid the rubble. The forces that led people to demand more from corporations, and that led corporations to demand more from themselves, haven’t vanished. Stakeholder capitalism may be ailing, but it isn’t dead. It’s taking a hard look at itself—and evolving. Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, may have been the first to coin “stakeholder capitalism,” in 1971. Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, Paul Newman, and Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry’s proved it could work. But the business-for-good era that defined the early part of this century had an origin of its own. After the 2008 financial crisis, low interest rates and cheap capital fueled a boom in mission-driven startups. They were largely run by young entrepreneurs, geared toward a generation frustrated with big corporations and with a government that had bailed out the bankers and dragged its feet on climate change. Many of these startups were able to grow quickly thanks to the mobile technology suddenly in everyone’s pocket. Business was now the fastest route to change. [Illustration: Raymond Biesinger] A whole ecosystem to support these companies sprang up, with nonprofits like Fair Trade USA and B Lab auditing companies’ business practices to certify them to consumers. Social entrepreneurship programs at business schools boomed, as did the number of B Lab’s Certified B Corporations, which rose twelvefold between 2010 and 2022. Then something interesting happened: The biggest corporations and investment firms in America joined in, largely because their employees wanted them to, and the low unemployment and tight labor markets of the second half of the 2010s forced them to comply. As Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer of Trillium Asset Management, one of the earliest socially responsible investment firms, says: “When government steps back, it doesn’t do away with the concerns that people have. People saw the enormous power that corporations represented and said, if that is where the power is, that is where I’m going to go to achieve my values.” Big corporations changed their policies to embrace diversity and sustainability and began taking vocal public positions on political issues, something they had typically shied away from for fear of alienating customers. Companies pressured North Carolina over the anti-transgender “bathroom bill” and Georgia over a voter-ID bill. They opposed Donald Trump’s Muslim ban. CEOs who hesitated to speak up often paid a reputational price: When Disney’s then-CEO Bob Chapek stayed silent about Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill (better known as the Don’t Say Gay bill), he was lambasted by employees until he apologized and the company announced it was formally opposing the bill. The moment it became clear that stakeholder capitalism had fully taken hold was when the Business Roundtable, a group of some of the most powerful corporations in America, issued a Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation in 2019 declaring that companies must commit themselves to “delivering value” to all stakeholders. “We thought this was going to be this big reckoning, this watershed moment where everything changes,” says Marcus Collins, former head of strategy at Wieden+Kennedy and an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. “People put on a good show. We had some really good thespians in the C-suite that projected a convincing sincerity. It felt like it was real. But the minute that they faced some discomfort, they bailed.” That discomfort started in the early 2020s, when inflation and interest rates rose, meaning that cheap capital was no longer easy to come by, slowing investment in idealistic upstarts and labor-intensive capital projects alike. High oil prices created by the sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine led companies to start speaking up about “energy security” rather than moving away from fossil fuels. In 2022, large-scale layoffs pummeled the tech industry, and the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 20%. By 2023, both Google and Meta had begun to scale back their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. When the stock price is falling, suddenly shareholders become the only stakeholders CEOs can hear. There had been “a faddish element about the whole thing,” says Ravi Dhar, a professor at Yale’s School of Management. “You had CEOs going to Davos and making a statement about being net zero by 2050, without any real idea of how to do that, and without really asking, ‘If we want to accomplish this, what should we be doing differently?’ It was just words on a page,” he adds. As Rose Marcario, former CEO of Patagonia, puts it, “If you never authentically stood for responsible supply chains or diversity and inclusion, no big surprise you drop it at the first sign of tension.” Nowhere was this truer than in Wall Street’s embrace of environmental, social, and governance investing. ESG-themed funds had ballooned from less than $50 billion in global assets in 2018 to more than $400 billion by 2022. But in 2023, the wind shifted. ESG investments in the U.S. have since suffered 10 consecutive quarters of declines, reflecting the fact that a lot of ESG investing was mostly a matter of marketing. While some investment firms, like Trillium, practiced socially responsible investing by combining fundamental analysis with shareholder advocacy, lots of ESG “investments” were little more than conventional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sold under a new name. The arguments that firms made for ESG were often confused and confusing. “Were you trying to make the world a better place with your investments, or were you trying to just divest from businesses you didn’t want to be in—which doesn’t really change anything—or were you trying to improve returns?” asks Tariq Fancy, formerly the chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock. Under CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock, the country’s largest investment firm, had been the highest-profile and loudest advocate for ESG. Fancy has since become one of the fiercest critics of the ESG movement. Not all of these initiatives were cynical exercises in marketing. As Fancy says, “Maybe the issue wasn’t greenwashing so much as greenwishing. But even so, ESG was not seriously trying to answer the problem it was trying to solve. It was offering virtue at a low cost.” Or, as he puts it more bluntly, “My read of Larry Fink is that he will do absolutely everything in his capacity to solve climate change, as long as it doesn’t cost him a cent.” (Fink didn’t respond to Fast Company’s request for an interview.) Plenty of CEOs felt the same way. In its original incarnation, stakeholderism was fundamentally about organizing a company’s entire business around social responsibility, doing what was possible to ensure that, in the words of David Bronner, “your operations are as",

Google Threat Intelligence Group warned Wednesday (June 4) that an organization specializing in voice phishing (vishing) is targeting Salesforce users. [contact-form-7] The attackers, dubbed UNC6040, have repeatedly been successful in recent months in breaching networks through social engineering schemes, GTIG said in a Wednesday blog post. UNC6040’s operators contact companies by telephone, impersonate IT support personnel, and trick employees into granting the attackers access or sharing credentials that can be used to steal the organization’s Salesforce data, according to the post. “In all observed cases, attackers relied on manipulating end users, not exploiting any vulnerability inherent to Salesforce,” the post said. Once they have compromised the Salesforce instance, the attackers steal data on a large scale and then try to extort the targeted company, per the post. “In some instances, extortion activities haven’t been observed until several months after the initial UNC6040 intrusion activity, which could suggest that UNC6040 has partnered with a second threat actor that monetizes access to the stolen data,” the post said. A Salesforce spokesperson told Bloomberg on Wednesday, in response to the Google post, “There’s no indication the issue described stems from any vulnerability inherent to our services. Attacks like voice phishing are targeted social engineering scams designed to exploit gaps in individual users’ cybersecurity awareness and best practices.” Salesforce provided tips on how to guard against social engineering threats in a March 12 blog post. GTIG suggested in its blog post that companies defend against social engineering threats by adhering to the principle of least privilege, managing access to connected applications rigorously, enforcing IP-based access restrictions, leveraging advanced security monitoring and policy enforcement with Salesforce Shield, and enforcing multifactor authentication universally. “While platforms like Salesforce provide robust, enterprise-grade security controls, it’s essential for customers to configure and manage access, permissions and user training according to best practices,” the post said. Social engineering fraud has increased by 56% in the past year, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “The State of Fraud and Financial Crime in the U.S. 2024: What FIs Need to Know.” The report found that fraudsters now rely on “customer-centric” tactics that leverage trust to bypass the robust security systems financial institutions have built around digital payments.

However, Salesforce executive Patrick Stokes cautions that it might not necessarily be the right path for everyone.\"I think it's easy for people to be enamored with the growth of kind of, moving up the ranks, rather than the growth of themselves personally,\" the executive vice president of product and industries marketing told Business Insider.Stokes, in a conversation during Salesforce's Agentforce World Tour in New York City, said whenever people tell him they want to move into management, he asks them why. Usually, people say that \"it's the next step,\" he told BI — and that's not enough of a reason.\"No, you need to know why you want to be a manager, because now you have to inspire a team,\" Stokes said. \"You have to think about your day-to-day job very differently.\"Salesforce EVP of talent growth and development Lori Castillo Martinez echoed a similar sentiment in a previous interview with BI. \"Being a deep expert isn't always an indicator of being a great manager,\" she said, adding that collaboration and task management skills are more important, and the best managers are those who can analyze their teams and maximize productivity.Responsibilities naturally shift when you transition from an individual contributor to a manager. Stokes said that if you take on a management role, you may not be able to do some of the things you value.Stokes, who started out as a developer and transitioned multiple times in his career, said he moved into management because he wanted to be a leader, and he was already acting like one.The Salesforce executive showcased the contrast in responsibilities between an individual contributor and a manager at the company's Agentforce conference. At the executive level, the job involves more than simply managing massive teams — it can often include public speaking at high-profile events. Stokes, for example, gave a keynote address at the event, opening with an energetic anecdote about recent events in New York City. Then, he introduced the company's digital workforce of AI agents, Agentforce, along with other speakers, all while walking through an auditorium of hundreds of people and talking directly to a video camera that trailed him.Stokes said he's always had strong opinions and a desire to rally others around his vision. From the time he was in high school, he found himself leading projects, despite frequently sitting in the back of the classroom. He said he didn't announce himself as the leader, but he was often the one coming up with ideas and convincing others to get on board.\"That's what you really need to have if you want to go into leadership,\" Stokes said.Stokes said that as soon as he feels \"not nervous\" about an event or meeting, he wants to try something new, and he's a big advocate for changing roles. The exec said some people tend to \"think too narrowly\" about changes and only want to switch roles if it's \"growth within the org chart.\" Stokes said that can be tough to find.\"If you value the growth, the personal growth that you're gonna get from that new role, enough, you should be willing to take a step back to go forward,\" Stokes said.Outside of leading Salesforce's product and industries marketing team, Stokes said he likes to play chess. He said there's a concept in chess called a \"gambit\" — fans of the hit Netflix show \"The Queen's Gambit\" will be familiar — where you make what appears to be a bad move, but is actually designed to get a reaction from an opponent. Stokes said that's how he likes to think about his career changes — seemingly risky but strategic long-term.\"When I first went into marketing, a lot of my peers and product were like, 'Why are you going to marketing?'

It went public again in 2021.“Joining forces with Salesforce represents a significant leap forward in our journey to bring data and AI to life by empowering businesses with the transformative power of their most critical asset — their data,” Informatica CEO Amit Walia said in a statement on Tuesday. “We have a shared vision for how we can help organizations harness the full value of their data in the AI era.”Robin Washington, president and chief operating and financial officer at Salesforce, said in a statement that the acquisition will look to take advantage of Informatica’s capabilities quickly, particularly in areas such as the public sector, life sciences, health care, and financial services.

Salesforce plans to acquire Informatica in an $8 billion deal, saying Informatica’s cloud data management capabilities will enhance the agentic artificial intelligence features of Salesforce’s customer relationship management platform. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ boards of directors and is expected to close early in Salesforce’s fiscal year 2027, subject to customary closing conditions, Salesforce said in a Tuesday (May 27) press release. “Bringing together Informatica’s cloud-native capabilities … with the Salesforce platform will unlock new capabilities for Salesforce’s enterprise data stack, delivering a complete solution to the challenges of AI at scale…,” the release said. Adding Informatica’s rich data catalog, data integration, governance, quality and privacy, metadata management and Master Data Management services to Salesforce’s Data Cloud, MuleSoft integration platform and Tableau analytics platform will strengthen Salesforce’s position in the market by enhancing the quality of its autonomous agents, the release said. The combination will ensure auditability and compliance; meaningful context for AI agents; and standardized, accurate, consistent and secure data, per the release. “Joining forces with Salesforce represents a significant leap forward in our journey to bring data and AI to life by empowering businesses with the transformative power of their most critical asset — their data,” Informatica CEO Amit Walia said in the release. It was reported April 12 that Salesforce was in advanced negotiations to acquire Informatica and that the deal would be Salesforce’s largest since its acquisition of Slack for $28 billion in 2021. Salesforce said May 16 that it plans to acquire Convergence.ai to accelerate the development of its next-generation AI agents. Convergence’s technology enables AI agents to navigate dynamic interfaces and adapt in real time so they can manage things like web-based workflows and multistep processes. Salesforce is seeing demand for its data cloud services as enterprises realize they have to better organize their data to fully tap the power of generative and agentic AI, Salesforce Senior Vice President of Product Management Gabrielle Tao told PYMNTS in an interview posted in April. “We make enterprise data ready for the agentic era,” Tao said. “We’re very excited to keep going and make agentic experiences world-class.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

        "description": "Getty images; Tyler Le/BIIwas in a particularly sour mood at an old job one afternoon when a notification popped up in Slack, reminding me to fill out my Peakon, the employee engagement survey our HR department used. In exchange for our candor, the HR team promised total anonymity and assured us that our concerns and comments would be heard by top brass.I liked my job, so I typically filled these surveys out with a perfunctory four-out-of-five-star acquiescence, never eager to rock the boat. I truly cannot recall now what had made my day so bad, but I decided to take it out on the survey. In response to extremely mundane questions about my daily motivation and whether my work goals were clearly defined, I said things like this organization absolutely stinks and our customers are marks. I was specific without revealing my identity, but I lurched roundhouse kicks like no sane person would work here if they had a better option. With the vitriol of an anonymous Yelp reviewer, I let 'er rip. It felt amazing — in the moment.The next morning, I found in my inbox a letter from the CEO.Sent via Peakon, it said something to the effect of, I can't tell who you are. But it seems you're unhappy. I have an offer for you. If I identified myself and then resigned, they'd give me a bit more than a standard severance. My resignation would be written as a layoff, so I could collect unemployment, and they'd even hook me up with the external recruiters they used to staff the company, to help me find a better role in some place where I would be happier. My employer was not doing layoffs or buyouts, and no one else, to my knowledge, had gotten this kind of offer. It seemed the object of my unhappiness at work had struck a nerve.While you may have a manager who genuinely loves you and wants you to be happy, the reality is that from an organizational perspective, your happiness at work has a literal, and hefty, price tag. Companies spend a fortune finding and hiring talent; it can cost 15% to 25% of a role's salary to source the right person to fill an opening. Maybe my old CEO (who through a representative declined to comment for this story) agreed strongly with the market firm MSW's survey that found that disengaged workers are 2.5 times as likely as an engaged worker to leave a company, and he just wanted me to get on with it.A Gallup survey found that about one-third of US workers were \"actively engaged\" at work in 2023, with the larger pool of less engaged and \"actively disengaged\" workers (who make mistakes at work more often and show up to work less often) accounting for an estimated $1.9 trillion in lost productivity. Our \"engagement\" — the quality by which work feels immediate and meaningful — was defined as recently as 1990 by the Boston University professor of organizational behavior William Kahn, whose studies around employee engagement transformed how corporations think about workforce productivity. Employees who are not able to engage with their jobs are rendered \"emotionally, cognitively and psychologically unavailable,\" as Kahn has put it. Negative and positive engagement is now considered an indicator of both positive and negative lagging effects for businesses, including profitability, turnover, and employee absenteeism. So for the last 35 years, HR departments everywhere have created a culture of questionnaires determined to uncover, isolate, and nurture their company's engagement.There's a very good chance you've been pinged and asked sometime in the past few months to fill out your Deel engagement survey, or your ThriveSparrow, SurveyMonkey, Workleap, Paycom, Lattice, People Element, or Engagedly. Software companies generated almost a billion dollars in 2023 selling and administering third-party engagement surveys to corporations everywhere. Peakon sold to Workday in 2021 for $700 million. A 2021 fundraising round catapulted the Melbourne, Australia-founded engagement startup Culture Amp to unicorn status, with a $1.5 billion valuation. The action is picking up, as increasingly dispersed post-COVID workforces have exacerbated the need for more vibe checks. If you're in the business of soliciting opinions from employees, business is booming.Less satisfied with employee satisfaction surveys are many of the employees taking them. Some two-thirds of US employees believe their companies don't respond to engagement surveys in a meaningful way, according to a Quantum Workplace survey of more than a thousand workers. \"Employee surveys mostly seem like a way for the executive suite to pat themselves on the back,\" Nick Gaudio, the creative director at the Austin-based chatbot startup Manychat, tells me. \"They want to believe in the power of anonymity to induce honesty, but at the end of the day, the power dynamic is always there, hanging over the head of their employees.\"While I experienced a surprising assertion of this power dynamics firsthand — my bosses didn't like my answers, and tried to do something about it — in general, the people I spoke to for this story placed surveys in the taxonomic rank of workplace annoyances somewhere around \"filling out timesheets.\" Surveys can be annoying because they're persistent, doubly so when you perceive that your employers won't do much with the results. This can lead to survey fatigue, where the response rate falls off a cliff after being asked to submit too many. When you're constantly filing your anonymous grievances into an anonymous digital suggestion box, you may begin to wonder not if the survey will help improve your workplace, but if you aren't perhaps participating in a kind of \"snitchware.\" Are you voluntarily telling on yourself?If we survey the history of surveys, we find that they were once considered novel, exciting, and based in real utility, much as the kanban project management board was born out of a working system in a real factory. Before World War I, most bosses were primarily concerned with their employees' external lives and work outcomes — the inner toils and happiness quotients mattered very little, as the historian Sanford Jacoby wrote in a 2008 paper called \"Employee Attitude Surveys in Historical Perspective.\" But strikes and wartime labor shortages gave the workforce some modicum of power. This gave the educational psychologist J. David Houser the perfect platform to take the \"consumer attitude studies\" he'd been doing on behalf of public utilities into an entirely new field of study: employee satisfaction and morale.While anonymity can lend itself to candor and equity, it sometimes fails in the way of promoting actual conversation and trust.By the early 1940s, satisfaction surveys found a champion in the armed forces. Because soldier morale began to be considered paramount to defense success, the military took the results of personnel surveys seriously. This led to some drastic changes, including introducing combat badges, requiring psychological evaluations for returned soldiers, and even helping along the eventual desegregation of the armed forces. (Today, the government's Office of Personnel Management notably conducts agency- and government-wide surveys as a resource for the public trust.) Decades later, Kahn, \"the godfather of employee engagement,\" set up a brilliant framework for understanding employee satisfaction outside the binary of happy/sad.That same anonymity that Gaudio railed against can also promote a kind of equity. Jenna Eichberg, the chief people officer at AlertMedia, tells me that because surveys aggregate an entire organization's feedback, you don't have to overindex your worry about the loudest outliers. \"You can't chase one person. You're here to serve a majority of your workforce,\" she says, and the beauty of the big dataset is that you can hear just as much from shy employees, or from \"people who're different than the ones who mostly talk to you in person.\" Phil Wilburn, the VP of people analytics at Workday, agrees. A survey, he tells me over email, \"gives people who might not feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting — whether they're introverted, more junior, or part of an underrepresented group — a safe space to share their thoughts. And it helps managers respond to those concerns thoughtfully, without putting anyone on the spot.\"Still, Eichberg says, if your employees don't feel heard, it's because you're not making them feel heard. \"The biggest mistake organizations make is they do all these surveys and they collect all this data, but they don't actually do something with it,\" she says. \"Or they do something with it, and they don't go back and tell their workforce what they did with it.\" The head of people at a small LA-based startup tells me that his organization similarly seems to freeze whenever a surprising result or answer pops out of the survey black box. \"I tell my CEO that by the time a comment winds up in the survey, it's already tried to reach you some other way,\" he says. Surveys, he continues, are \"only as good as the relationships between the people in the company and only as effective as the executives who have to do something about it.\"So while anonymity can lend itself to candor and equity, it might still sometimes fail in the way of promoting actual conversation and trust. Consider a 2021 survey from The Workforce Institute that found that only 37% of entry-level employees believe their colleagues are completely honest in their answers and assessments. If 43% of workers fear retaliation for speaking up at work, per a survey from the Institute of Business Ethics, anonymity can only help so much. In the same way remote employees have learned to keep their Slack icon \"green,\" to avoid suspicion of blowing off work, some workers have self-taught to never be entirely honest with their HR surveys. Last year at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo requiring five-days-a-week RTO, touching on connection and communication as principal tenets for this decision. Enough workers were dissatisfied en",

        "description": "You sit down to tackle your to-do list, full of energy and ambition—but 20 minutes later, you’re bouncing between emails, Slack notifications, and random tabs about vacation deals. Another hour slips away. Sound familiar? In today’s distraction-saturated workplaces, focus has become one of the most valuable—and elusive—skills we can master. The good news is that the focus isn’t just a matter of willpower. It’s a rhythm that can be trained, like learning how to play an instrument. Drawing from decades as a professional musician and a consultant in neuroscience-based productivity strategies, I’ve seen firsthand how much the brain responds to rhythm, structure, and intentional habits. Just like musicians tune their instruments and warm up before a concert, you can “tune” your brain to perform at its peak during the workday. Neuroscience backs this up: When we align our work with our brain’s natural cycles and cognitive strengths, we get more done—with less stress. Here’s how to use music-inspired rituals and brain science to sharpen your focus at work. Sync Your Brain to the Beat with Rhythmic Work Blocks Think of your workday like a symphony: It should rise and fall with a natural rhythm, not be an endless marathon of tasks. Our brains function in ultradian rhythms, alternating between 90- and 120-minute cycles of alertness and fatigue. Pioneering sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman discovered these cycles decades ago, and more recent studies, like those published in Progress in Brain Research, confirm that pushing beyond them leads to cognitive exhaustion. Instead of battling fatigue, structure your day into focused sprints followed by intentional breaks. Aim for 45 to 90 minutes of deep work, then take a 10- to 20-minute recovery break. How to do it: Set a timer for 60 minutes of focused work. Step away after the timer goes off—stretch, walk, breathe. Repeat the cycle two or three times for maximum cognitive performance. Just as music isn’t continuous noise without rests, your brain needs pauses to maintain focus. Set a Daily “Tempo” Check Before musicians start playing, they check the tempo and key of the piece. You should do the same with your mental state. Research published in The Journal of Neuroscience shows that emotions significantly influence attention and cognitive flexibility. If you’re tired, anxious, or distracted, deep strategic work may be unrealistic for that moment. Taking a few minutes each morning to assess your energy levels gives you agency over your day rather than letting it control you. How to do it: Quickly rate your current focus and energy from 1 to 10. If you’re below a 5, begin the day with lighter tasks like email cleanup or administrative work to build momentum. Reserve your high-focus work—like strategic planning or deep analysis—for when your tempo feels strong. Self-awareness builds cognitive resilience and keeps you from setting unrealistic expectations that undercut your performance. Use Music (Strategically) to Trigger Flow States Music can either help you focus or completely derail you. It depends on how you use it. Studies from Stanford University show that listening to music engages areas of the brain involved with paying attention and making predictions. However, lyrics and sharp tempo changes can split our attention and decrease deep focus. To enter a productive flow state, choose music that supports sustained concentration: Instrumental tracks Consistent rhythms Ambient sounds or lo-fi beats Some productivity apps, like Brain.fm, use neuroscience-based compositions to optimize focus. For example, lo-fi hip-hop playlists on Spotify are popular because of their steady, nondistracting beats. How to do it: Build a “focus playlist” with 1 to 2 hours of instrumental music. Use it only during work sessions when you want to mentally prime for deep focus. Over time, your brain will associate this music with “work mode” and transition more quickly into flow. Set a “Cue and Play” Ritual Before Deep Work Before performing onstage, musicians don’t just walk out cold. They have rituals: tuning instruments, breathing exercises, and visualization. Creating a consistent prework ritual signals your brain that it’s time for focus. This taps into a principle known as implementation intention, a psychological strategy proven to increase goal attainment by 300%, according to research published in Psychological Science. How to do it: Create a three-step warm-up to do before every deep work session. Stretch for two minutes. Brew a cup of tea or light a candle. Put on your focus playlist. These small, intentional actions trigger the brain’s “ready” state, helping you transition more smoothly into concentration. Rituals transform discipline into automatic behavior—freeing up mental energy for actual work. Break Projects Into Rhythmic Movements Like symphonies with movements—intro, crescendo, finale—big projects need natural segmentation, or a way of breaking things up into smaller categories. The human brain can comfortably hold about 4 to 7 items in working memory at once (as per research published in Cognitive Psychology). Large, ambiguous tasks overwhelm that limit, causing procrastination and fatigue. How to do it: Divide big projects into distinct phases: planning, drafting, editing, review, and delivery. Set milestone markers between each phase so you get a sense of closure as you progress. By thinking in “movements” rather than one massive project, you build momentum and reduce your cognitive overload. Eliminate “Syncopation,” or Unnecessary Disruptions In music, syncopation—unexpected shifts in rhythm—adds excitement. At work, unexpected disruptions usually add chaos. Studies from the University of California, Irvine, found that it takes 23 minutes to refocus fully after a distraction. Every ping, notification, or email breaks your cognitive rhythm and burns valuable attention energy. How to do it: Schedule deep work sprints, where you put devices on Do Not Disturb. Use apps like Freedom, Cold Turkey, or RescueTime to block distracting sites during these periods. Tell your team when you’re in a focused block so that they know not to interrupt unless it is urgent. You can put focus blocks on your work calendar that are visible to everyone, or even better, set your Slack status to “in deep work.” Guard your rhythm the way a conductor guards the tempo of an orchestra. Otherwise, you’re allowing random inputs to conduct your brain for you. Use Silence to Reset Your Brain’s Rhythm In music, silence isn’t absence—it’s intentional space that gives the sound its shape. Similarly, research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that periods of intentional silence promote brain regeneration, particularly in the hippocampus, which is associated with memory and learning. Small doses of quiet can dramatically reset attention and creativity. How to do it: After every major work block, spend 3 to 5 minutes in silence. No music. No podcasts. No screens. Just focus on breathing and mental stillness. This small practice strengthens your brain’s default mode network—the cognitive system responsible for creativity, problem-solving, and insight. In a world addicted to noise, silence can become your competitive advantage. Tune Your Brain Like an Instrument The ability to focus isn’t just a matter of working harder. It’s about working in rhythm with your brain’s natural cycles. By intentionally syncing with your cognitive rhythms—through music-inspired rituals, breaks, warm-ups, and boundaries—you can dramatically improve your ability to enter deep work states, stay there longer, and feel less drained at the end of the day. You don’t need more apps, hacks, or superhuman willpower to focus. You need a better rhythm. Treat your day like a musical performance, and your brain will follow the beat.",

Salesforce plans to acquire Convergence.ai to accelerate the development of its next-generation AI agents. The company signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition and expects Convergence’s team and technology to play a “central role” in advancing its AI agent platform, Agentforce, according to a Thursday (May 15) press release. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of Salesforce’s fiscal year 2026, subject to customary closing conditions, according to the release. “The next wave of customer interaction and employee productivity will be driven by highly capable AI agents that can navigate the complexities of today’s digital work,” Adam Evans, executive vice president and general manager, Salesforce AI Platform at Salesforce, said in the release. “Convergence’s innovative approach to building adaptive, intelligent agents is incredibly impressive.” Convergence’s technology enables AI agents to navigate dynamic interfaces and adapt in real time so they can manage things like web-based workflows and multi-step processes, according to the release. The company’s talent is also expected to contribute to deep research, task automation and industry-specific solutions that will advance Salesforce’s broader AI roadmap, per the release. “Our mission at Convergence is to help organizations stop viewing automation as just another tool and instead adopt it as the very way work gets done — unlocking new levels of innovation and efficiency,” Convergence CEO and Co-founder Marvin Purtorab said in the release. “Joining Salesforce is the ideal step to scale that vision.” Salesforce is seeing “massive” growth in its data cloud platform, fueled by interest in generative and agentic AI from enterprises, Gabrielle Tao, senior vice president of product management at Salesforce, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in April. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Salesforce Data Cloud booked $900 million in revenue, up 120% year over year. “We make enterprise data ready for the agentic era,” Tao said. “We’re very excited to keep going and make agentic experiences world class.” Salesforce itself uses AI agents, Evans said in March at the HumanX conference in Las Vegas. For instance, the company uses AI agents to help customers who have questions about the Salesforce platform, their accounts and similar queries, and finds that the AI agents resolve all but 3% of the cases.

Salesforce Ventures, which first invested in Wiz's Series B in 2021, will make roughly $600 million on the deal, Benioff said. (Salesforce's profit on the Wiz acquisition has not been previously reported. A spokesperson for Salesforce Ventures declined to comment on the firm's profits from the Wiz acquisition, citing the ongoing nature of the deal.)\"I worked directly with Assaf Rappaport,\" Benioff said, referring to Wiz's CEO and cofounder. \"I enjoy working with entrepreneurs.

Most of these companies do not work out.\"Amid the AI hype cycle and a boom in venture investing, Benioff still sees founders' grit — even in himself. It's a mentality he, after decades of building Salesforce into a giant, hasn't quite yet shaken. \"We still pivot like an entrepreneur has to pivot,\" Benioff said. \"We're still in founder mode at Salesforce.

To get up to speed, she pulled up Salesforce's Slack AI chatbot, typed in \"EV contractors,\" and received a dossier of previous sales, call recordings, and industry trends.\"I don't have a vertical, so I'm no industry expert in regards to electric vehicle contracting,\" Gault said. \"That's a way for me to really quickly get up to speed on who this customer is. What were the previous conversations with Salesforce? Who are the key stakeholders?\"Gault isn't alone in harnessing AI tools for her sales role. When McKinsey asked about 1,500 companies about how they used generative AI, sales and marketing were the most common responses.Dan Gottlieb, Gartner's vice president analyst for sales, told Business Insider that sales professionals are an industrious group of self-starters who are actively searching for new AI use cases. They use artificial intelligence to compile research, develop leads, and even hone their pitching skills, Gottlieb said.But the increasing implementation of AI in sales raises the question: Could this integration diminish the power of human connection? Corporate selling is, after all, a fundamentally human process that relies on relationship building, typically via phone calls and client dinners.At Salesforce, its 25,000 sellers use AI tools to improve their human approach to sales, not erase it, Connor Marsden, the company's North America president of industrial, consumer, and energy, told BI.How AI can bolster seller goalsThe Columbia Business School professor Michael Brown said he'd noticed some sales professionals worrying about whether AI is dehumanizing the selling process.\"I don't know any buyer who wants to be sold to by a copilot,\" Brown told BI.He added that there would always be client-buyers who want to have in-person conversations with sellers about pricing, discounts, and legal agreements. At the same time, Brown said he had a positive outlook on AI's expansion to sales processes, so long as it continues to enhance worker performance.To do that, sellers should think about applying AI to their daily unstructured tasks, like client research, brainstorming how to approach a particular situation, and making sense of large amounts of information quickly, Gottlieb said.Gault, for example, has shared parts of her favorite sales-related book with Salesforce's autonomous AI agent, Sales Coach. After Gault input passages from \"Never Split the Difference\" by the former FBI hostage negotiator Christopher Voss into her agent, it offered her advice based on Voss' techniques, like to acknowledge customers' emotions when they express frustrations.With Sales Coach, Gault said she could role-play and get a critique of her performance to prepare for client meetings.Gault, who works remotely from Pittsburgh, said these AI-powered tools help her prepare for customer interactions because she often lacks in-person colleagues to role-play with and receive feedback from.The evolution of AI use at SalesforceAI isn't new in Salesforce's operations, but its utility continues to change, Kris Billmaier, the executive vice president and general manager of Sales Cloud and growth products at Salesforce, told BI.He said the company had invested in predictive and assistive AI tools, as well as autonomous AI agents.For autonomous AI, Billmaier used the example of updating client statuses in Sales Cloud, Salesforce's platform for tracking sellers' statuses for each of their clients, from generating leads to closing deals. He said Salesforce's predictive AI used to make status-update recommendations based on its analysis of a sales lead's communications. To complete the process of approving and recording the status change, sellers had to review the AI's recommendation, then manually click \"accept.\"But as sellers became more acquainted with the AI's suggestions, Salesforce began to use autonomous agents for that process. Now sellers can set up an agent to approve their status changes without human intervention.AI adoption requires employee awareness and accessibilityBringing AI to a workplace so dependent on human connection is no easy feat. Marsden said it's a \"new motion\" many sellers aren't used to.He said a solution is to ensure that AI-powered features are \"living and breathing\" in the tools that sellers use every day.When, for example, a customer tells Gault that they're using HubSpot, a competing marketing software, she looks to the right-hand corner of her screen. There, her Sales Coach autonomous AI agent is already populating ways other sellers have tackled objections from HubSpot users.Salesforce sellers can also find Slack's AI chatbot among their options for colleagues to message.\"There's a baked-in incentive for them to be really good at using AI so they can come across authentically in front of their customers,\" Marsden said.\"The human side is having the conversation, doing the discovery, and inquiring about what the customer's needs are,\" he said. \"And then AI is there to complement, to help you make sure you captured all the needed feedback.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Getty Images; Karan Singh for BICorporate sales work often requires face-to-face meetings and client calls.At Salesforce, sellers use AI-powered tech to help them prepare for these conversations.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.After a long day of meeting with clients, Haley Gault, a Salesforce seller, received a last-minute ping from a customer saying they wanted to meet with her face-to-face within the hour.Gault started to sweat: The customer's business, electric vehicle charging stations, was not a topic she knew well.

Corporate selling is, after all, a fundamentally human process that relies on relationship building, typically via phone calls and client dinners.At Salesforce, its 25,000 sellers use AI tools to improve their human approach to sales, not erase it, Connor Marsden, the company's North America president of industrial, consumer, and energy, told BI.How AI can bolster seller goalsThe Columbia Business School professor Michael Brown said he'd noticed some sales professionals worrying about whether AI is dehumanizing the selling process.\"I don't know any buyer who wants to be sold to by a copilot,\" Brown told BI.He added that there would always be client-buyers who want to have in-person conversations with sellers about pricing, discounts, and legal agreements. At the same time, Brown said he had a positive outlook on AI's expansion to sales processes, so long as it continues to enhance worker performance.To do that, sellers should think about applying AI to their daily unstructured tasks, like client research, brainstorming how to approach a particular situation, and making sense of large amounts of information quickly, Gottlieb said.Gault, for example, has shared parts of her favorite sales-related book with Salesforce's autonomous AI agent, Sales Coach. After Gault input passages from \"Never Split the Difference\" by the former FBI hostage negotiator Christopher Voss into her agent, it offered her advice based on Voss' techniques, like to acknowledge customers' emotions when they express frustrations.With Sales Coach, Gault said she could role-play and get a critique of her performance to prepare for client meetings.Gault, who works remotely from Pittsburgh, said these AI-powered tools help her prepare for customer interactions because she often lacks in-person colleagues to role-play with and receive feedback from.The evolution of AI use at SalesforceAI isn't new in Salesforce's operations, but its utility continues to change, Kris Billmaier, the executive vice president and general manager of Sales Cloud and growth products at Salesforce, told BI.He said the company had invested in predictive and assistive AI tools, as well as autonomous AI agents.For autonomous AI, Billmaier used the example of updating client statuses in Sales Cloud, Salesforce's platform for tracking sellers' statuses for each of their clients, from generating leads to closing deals. He said Salesforce's predictive AI used to make status-update recommendations based on its analysis of a sales lead's communications. To complete the process of approving and recording the status change, sellers had to review the AI's",

        "description": "Sometimes, you need to shake things up in your career. Maybe the job isn’t as fulfilling anymore. Maybe changing circumstances are pushing you toward a new path. Either way, figuring out what to do next can be a challenge. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is helping people explore their next steps—even when they’re unsure themselves. Chatbots like ChatGPT can offer some guidance, provided you know how to phrase your questions. But several companies have developed specialized tools that focus specifically on this issue. Google is leading the pack with its Career Dreamer. Described as “a playful way to explore career possibilities with AI,” it’s a tool that anyone can use. To get started with Career Dreamer, you’ll develop a “career identity statement,” which outlines your skills and experiences. After sharing your current job, the AI will ask follow-up questions about what that role involved. You can also add details about your educational background and any careers, industries, or fields that interest you. Career Dreamer then suggests potential career paths based on your input. (For example, among its alternate career suggestions for me were communications/public relations specialist, communications professor, and market research analyst—along with several jobs in the reporting field.) Hovering your mouse over each suggested field provides information about the type of degree typically required, the experience you’ll generally need, a description of the job, and—if you click through—the average salary. Find something that looks intriguing? You can click through to a list of local job opportunities or jump over to the Gemini AI tool to craft a résumé or cover letter. LinkedIn, meanwhile, offers the Next Role Explorer for users whose companies subscribe to its Learning Hub. That tool showcases potential opportunities within the company, suggests skills employees should develop, and shows how many openings exist in each role. It also displays the percentage of people who have successfully transitioned from the employee’s current role to the new one. AI, for that service, acts as a career coach, offering recommended courses and career paths. It also helps employees stay on track as they work toward acquiring the skills needed for a new role. At Salesforce, the company rolled out Career Connect last September—an internal talent marketplace that uses AI to help employees create personalized career paths tailored to their skills and aspirations. The tool is embedded in Salesforce’s Slack workflow. Employees can view roles they’re currently qualified for, as well as positions where their skills are easily transferable. If a job catches their interest, they can apply directly within Slack. Early results, Salesforce says, have been extremely positive: Ninety-one percent of the roles that were filled went to participants in the Career Connect pilot program who discovered those opportunities through the tool. During the three-month trial, 28% of participants applied for jobs via the platform. Given the ongoing fears that AI will take people’s jobs—freelance positions have already seen a 21% drop in demand—it’s somewhat reassuring to see it also being used to help people find them.",

        "description": "You’re already juggling competing deadlines, back-to-back meetings, and strategic priorities. Then the Slack message arrives: “Hey, can you just take care of this?” It’s not in your job description. It’s not aligned with your goals. And it’s not the first time. Whether it’s managing logistics, picking up someone else’s project, or being asked to take notes again—many workers are routinely handed tasks that fall outside their role. Often, it’s framed as being a “team player.” But over time, these extra asks can add up to chronic overwork, blurred boundaries, and a stalled career trajectory. Handling these situations well isn’t about being difficult—it’s about being strategic. Here’s how to respond in ways that are clear, confident, and aligned with your long-term goals. 1. Clarify the request—and its relevance Before you respond, take a moment to understand the ask. What’s really being requested? Who should be doing it? And why is it coming to you? This is especially important for tasks that seem “quick” but aren’t strategic—like organizing team events, taking meeting minutes, or picking up admin no one else wants. These are often invisible labor tasks that disproportionately fall on women and people of color, particularly in hybrid and virtual environments. What to say: “Happy to support—can you help me understand how this fits within my priorities or where it came from?” Or: “Is this something our [ops/admin/project] team would usually handle?” Asking these questions reframes the conversation and makes the invisible visible—without defensiveness. 2. Pause before responding You don’t have to answer immediately. One of the biggest reasons we say yes to things we don’t want (or need) to do is because we’re caught off guard. We’re conditioned to be agreeable and responsive. But taking a beat creates space between the request and your response. That pause can be powerful. It allows you to assess: Do I have the capacity? Is this aligned with my role and goals? What’s the real cost of saying yes? What to say: “Thanks for thinking of me—can I come back to you on this once I’ve reviewed my priorities for the week?” This puts you back in control and gives you room to respond with intention rather than obligation. 3. Don’t confuse being helpful with being responsible There’s a big difference between offering support as a leader and being expected to clean up someone else’s mess. Many high-performing workers default to “I’ll just do it” because it feels faster or more efficient in the moment. But over time, it leads to scope creep, burnout, and resentment. Tasks like organizing team birthdays, onboarding new hires without a handover, or smoothing out interpersonal dynamics often land on women—not because they’re in your job description, but because you’re seen as the reliable one. What to do: Ask yourself: “Is this a one-off favor or an ongoing expectation?” Track how often it happens—and the impact on your core responsibilities. Notice if it’s being evenly distributed across the team—or falling on you by default. Being helpful is a strength. But when it’s at the expense of your boundaries, clarity, or energy, it’s time to draw a line. 4. Practice saying no—without guilt Saying no can feel uncomfortable, especially when you want to be seen as collaborative and competent. But “no” doesn’t have to be harsh. It can be thoughtful, respectful, and still assert your priorities. What to say: “I’m currently at capacity with my core responsibilities and can’t take this on right now.” “That’s outside my scope, and I want to make sure I’m focused on where I can add the most value.” “I’m not the best person for this, but happy to suggest someone who might be.” The key is to remove apology from your tone. You’re not being difficult—you’re being discerning. And that’s what leadership requires. 5. Raise the bigger conversation when needed If you’re regularly being asked to do tasks outside your role—or expected to manage things that aren’t aligned with your position—it’s time to step back and zoom out. This isn’t just about one request. It’s about your scope, your role clarity, and the culture you’re operating in. Use your next check-in or performance review to re-align. Be honest about what you’ve taken on, how it’s impacted your work, and what needs to shift. What to say: “I’ve noticed I’m consistently being asked to take on tasks that sit outside my formal role. I want to make sure I’m being as impactful as possible in my core responsibilities—can we talk about boundaries, priorities, and how to structure my work accordingly?” This kind of conversation not only protects your time—it models leadership for others who might also be navigating blurred lines. The bottom line: Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. Your energy, time, and talent are precious—and finite. Protecting your scope isn’t selfish. It’s strategic. It’s how you stay focused on the work that matters, create sustainable success, and lead with clarity and confidence.",

Customer relationship management (CRM) giant Salesforce is seeing “massive” growth in its data cloud platform, fueled by interest in generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) from enterprises, according to one of the company’s senior executives. In an exclusive interview with PYMNTS, Gabrielle Tao, senior vice president of product management at Salesforce, said the company is seeing robust demand for its data cloud services as enterprises realize they have to better organize their data to fully tap the power of AI. “We make enterprise data ready for the agentic era,” Tao said, adding that the platform has seen strong growth in recent years. “We’re very excited to keep going and make agentic experiences world class.” In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Salesforce Data Cloud booked $900 million in revenue, up 120% year over year. The company said the platform is used by nearly half of Fortune 100 companies. In Q4 alone, all of its top 10 deals included both AI and data cloud components. Why all this interest in data alongside AI? AI is fueled by data. Without data, AI is useless. AI is trained by data. It analyzes, makes predictions and learns new capabilities using data. It ingests text, images, videos, audio, code, sensor readings, math and other types of data — whether they reside in PDFs, emails, social media posts, spreadsheets, CRM systems, HR databases and many more media. But in most companies, data is not organized well. It is in many places, batches are closed off from each other. Before data is ready for AI, it must be cleaned, unified, well-structured, governed and — ideally — real-time and searchable. Only then can AI be accurate, relevant and safe. “Whenever companies say they have ‘unified’ data, a lot of times what that means is they’ve centralized the storage,” Tao said. The reality is that in many cases, “they’re not able to unlock the value of the data in real time for business applications and business agents.” According to a 2024 Harvard Business Review article, senior managers often complain “they don’t have data they really need and don’t trust what they have. … The hype around AI exacerbates those concerns.” Salesforce has been tackling this unglamorous but critical problem. Tao joined the company in 2019 to solve this problem by creating Data Cloud. According to Gartner Peer Insights, the platform was given four out of five stars among 119 companies that have used it. However, in 2024, one 2-star review cited cost as a concern and a handful of 3-star reviews cited lack of good documentation, limited features and integration issues. Salesforce’s Data Cloud competitors include Adobe Real-Time CDP, Oracle Unity Customer Data Platform, among others. Read more: Salesforce to Launch AI Agents and Cloud-Based POS for Retailers Down and Dirty With Data To be sure, problems with organizational data have been around for decades. Many vendors offer to organize an enterprise’s data, such as Snowflake, Databricks and the cloud computing giants. They offer to unify data into data lakes or data warehouses. Since the problem is not new, many companies are actually in some phase of data organization, Tao said. But unifying data remains a big lift for many. “Probably 97% of the customers I talk to today, they have some form of data lake, data warehouse. Universally, that is pretty much true,” Tao said. “At the same time, the data is quite trapped in those places.” That’s because they were built for analysts and data scientists, she said. For business users, “there is very limited ability to tap into the vastness of all that data.” “How does that translate to something that makes sense for … the customer-facing agent performing the sales function?” Tao asked. She said Salesforce set out to make it accessible to business users. Originally conceived as a customer data platform (CDP) in 2019 focused on marketing use cases, Salesforce Data Cloud has transformed into what Tao calls a “universal data activation layer” for all Salesforce applications, spanning sales, service, commerce, analytics and AI. Unlike traditional data platforms that duplicate or copy data through complex extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, data cloud uses a “zero copy” architecture — something the company pioneered, according to Tao. Zero copy pulls in metadata from disparate data sources without physically moving the data, allowing companies to harmonize, govern and activate their data in place. That means enterprises don’t need to unravel what they’ve built, Tao explained. Tao said the result is a real-time, unified view of the customer that both human and AI agent workers can access without having to replicate or recode business logic across hundreds of systems. Since the AI uses the company’s own data, it mitigates hallucinations as well, Tao said. Salesforce also offers a governance layer that lets companies do things like set access permissions for both human and AI agent workers. For example, companies can specify what data an entry-level sales representative can see and which objects a chatbot can access. This ability will be key when using multilayers of AI agents, she said. The post Salesforce SVP: Enterprise AI Driving Growth in Data Cloud Business appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Executives from AWS, Salesforce and Oracle believe that artificial intelligence (AI) agents will upend the world of work in ways people today might not expect. Consider the following potential future scenarios: You can talk directly to a software program to get what you need instead of clicking through menus and settings. An AI agent will take care of a customer calling into a call center from start to finish. Software integration will not be needed anymore because the AI agent will just click through the other software like a human would. Two years after the ChatGPT moment, “we have entered an even more transformative phase with generative AI,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS. “The emergence of agentic AI applications really represents a fundamental shift in its capability.” Unlike earlier generative AI capabilities, AI agents can reason, plan and complete tasks on behalf of humans or systems. They can research, pay bills, manage enterprise applications and even decompose high-level objectives into executable steps, Sivasubramanian said. Down the road, he envisions a “fully AI world” where AI agents make decisions, automate workflows and coordinate by themselves with less human oversight. “But this evolution is not a roadmap for the future. In fact, most of it is already happening today.” AI agents are helping biotech company Genentech automate drug research, saving nearly five years of work, according to Sivasubramanian. Credit ratings company Moody’s has used them to shorten its credit risk reporting process from a week to less than an hour. “This is exactly the kind of breakthrough in productivity and scale you’re going to be able to achieve with customers adopting agentic AI,” Sivasubramanian said at last week’s HumanX conference in Las Vegas. Read more: Deloitte Begins Rollout of AI Agents for Finance and Other Business Functions Salesforce’s Vision for ‘Limitless Labor’ Adam Evans, executive vices president and general manager of Salesforce AI, said the company’s AI agent platform, Agentforce, has seen “overwhelming demand” in the fourth quarter — its first full quarter of selling the service. More than 5,000 customers have signed up, which is “incredible early demand,” Evans said at a separate discussion at the HumanX conference. As more companies use AI agents, he said this becomes a “limitless labor” pool. Salesforce itself uses agents. For instance, an AI agent helps customers who have questions about the Salesforce platform, their accounts and similar queries. Evans said the AI agents resolved all but 3% of the cases, which are then escalated to human representatives. Evans sees the next level for customer service comprising of AI agents that can do more than just answer and refer queries. “Just like a brand ambassador, you’re going to have an AI agent that knows you as a customer, that can help sell, help understand your account, can escalate when necessary, and just kind of be a touchpoint the whole way,” he said. Evans cited three types of AI agents: External agent that interacts with the customers through chat, email and voice. Internal agent that interacts with employees through channels like Slack, helping them in their workflows and the like. Background agent that works behind the scenes to do things like look at sales leads in the CRM, do research and analyze client communication. Evans cited examples from early adopters like Wiley Publishing, which reported a 40% increase in customer satisfaction due to AI-driven customer service agents. Pfizer has started using AI agents to assist in life sciences as well. “We’re seeing customers in regulated industries as well” using agents, he said. Salesforce has structured its business model to accommodate this shift, introducing flexible pricing that allows customers to transition between traditional seat-based pricing and AI consumption-based models. Read more: OpenAI Launches New Tools for Building AI Agents AI Agents as a New Work Paradigm Miranda Nash, group vice president at Oracle AI, sees AI agents becoming the primary interaction layer between users and enterprise software, eliminating the need for complex interfaces. “Let’s stop adapting ourselves to computers and make them adapt to us,” Nash said. That means users might not have to click through the menus of Oracle software to navigate it. “In the future, we really believe you can just ask Oracle questions, and that leads to, behind the scenes, a rather complex, potentially multi-agent workflow,” Nash said during a presentation at the HumanX conference in Las Vegas. Today, Oracle embeds AI agents across HR, finance, supply chain, and operations, enabling departments to automate their own processes. For HR, it means AI-driven hiring processes; for finance, it’s AI optimizing accounts payable; for supply chains, it’s automated logistics management. Every role is being enhanced by AI, she said. Nash has the same view as Evans and Sivasubramanian that AI agents will fundamentally reshape employment. But all three downplayed fears of mass job cuts. “There’s definitely going to be some displacement and there’s going to be more opportunities,” Evans said. Evans highlighted Salesforce’s own experience: Employees previously tasked with repetitive customer support roles are now being moved into higher-value customer success and sales positions. Sivasubramanian said AI agents are enabling companies to streamline workflows, reduce training times and free employees from mundane tasks. He said AWS’s internal AI deployment saved Amazon itself 4,500 developer years’ worth of work and over $250 million in capital expenses. “I think that’s pretty incredible,” Sivasubramanian said. Said Nash: “The only option now is to get in the cloud, get to agents, and meet the future of this world of work.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

OpenAI […] The post Report: OpenAI to Test Feature Connecting ChatGPT to Slack and Google Drive appeared first on PYMNTS.com. OpenAI is reportedly set to start testing a feature called ChatGPT Connectors that will let business customers connect Slack and Google Drive to ChatGPT. This feature will enable the chatbot to access files, presentations, spreadsheets and Slack conversations in those accounts to answer questions, TechCrunch reported Monday (March 17), citing a document it viewed. OpenAI did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. ChatGPT Connectors will launch in beta for select ChatGPT Team subscribers, according to the TechCrunch report. The company plans to expand the feature to Microsoft SharePoint and Box in the future, the report said. It was reported in February that OpenAI’s enterprise business had 2 million paying users, around double the number it had in September. “We get a lot of benefits and a tailwind from the organic consumer adoption where people already have familiarity with the product,” OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC at the time. “There’s really healthy growth on a different curve.” Home improvement retailer Lowe’s said March 12 that it collaborated with OpenAI and leveraged its own expert advice to create an artificial intelligence (AI) virtual home improvement assistant. The tool lets customers get answers to project how-to questions while also searching for the proper products for their job. In February, it was reported that OpenAI launched a multiyear agreement with BNY that gives the bank access to the AI company’s tools to boost BNY’s in-house AI platform, Eliza. “We feel AI has transformational power and will be part of every product and service,” Sarthak Pattanaik, head of BNY’s AI hub, told The Wall Street Journal at the time. AI datasets are changing how businesses handle everything from customer service to inventory management, PYMNTS reported in November. For example, companies build product recommendation systems trained on datasets containing millions of customer purchase histories and product interactions to suggest relevant items. Klarna said in May 2024 that its internal AI assistant, Kiki, was being used by 85% of the company’s employees, was answering 2,000 employee questions per day and had responded to more than 250,000 inquiries since it was launched about 11 months earlier.

        "description": "Parker Conrad and Alex Bouaziz.Amy Osborne/The Washington Post/Getty Images; Deel; Melia Russell/Business Insider; Deel; Melia Russell/Business InsiderHR software company Rippling is suing rival Deel, alleging it used a spy to steal company secrets.The lawsuit says Rippling caught the spy through a honeypot email to Deel's top leaders.The alleged spy locked himself in a bathroom when approached with a court order, the lawsuit says.The executives at Rippling had a problem.Private information from the company kept leaking, the company said in a lawsuit filed Monday.Recruiters at one of its chief rivals, Deel, had contacted more than a dozen Rippling employees on their personal phone numbers, which were unlisted, the lawsuit said.Then a journalist approached Rippling, a workforce management software company, with a story claiming it may have violated sanctions, citing messages from Rippling's Slack channels, according to the lawsuit.After launching an investigation, Rippling found an employee in Ireland they now say was a spy digging for corporate secrets to pass off to the company's competition.The employee, who oversaw payroll issues in Europe, was looking at Slack channels with \"no connection to his payroll operations job responsibilities\" and searching for the term \"Deel\" more than a dozen times per day, according to a lawsuit, filed against Deel in San Francisco federal court.The man — who is not named in the lawsuit — found sensitive information about potential customers who were looking to switch from Deel to Rippling, the lawsuit says. He downloaded a 31-slide deck that explained Rippling's strategy for competing with Deel, the lawsuit alleges.Rippling's leadership believed they found their mole. So they set up a honeypot operation.Believing that Deel \"was most likely to activate its spy if faced with potentially damaging press,\" Rippling's general counsel emailed a legal letter to three of Deel's top leaders. The letter identified a Slack channel called \"#d-defectors,\" where Rippling employees discussed information that Deel would find embarrassing if made public.In reality, the \"#d-defectors\" channel did not exist until shortly before Rippling sent the letter to Deel, the lawsuit says.\"Rather than being a gathering place for ex-Deel employees, the channel was set up as part of a ruse designed to confirm that Deel was instructing D.S. to search for specific information in Rippling's Slack,\" Rippling's lawsuit says, referring to the alleged \"Deel's spy.\"Deel \"took the bait,\" the lawsuit says. Just hours after Rippling sent the letter, the spy searched for and accessed the channel, the lawsuit alleges.It was a \"smoking gun\" that Deel's highest echelon — or someone working on its behalf — fed information to the alleged spy, Rippling said in the lawsuit.Over the course of four months, the alleged spy pulled information from Rippling's Slack, shared Google Drive, Salesforce database, and internal human resources directory, the lawsuit says.A representative for Deel denied \"all legal wrongdoing\" and said Rippling was trying to distract from claims that it violated sanctions laws, which Rippling denies.\"Weeks after Rippling is accused of violating sanctions law in Russia and seeding falsehoods about Deel, Rippling is trying to shift the narrative with these sensationalized claims,\" a Deel spokeswoman said in a statement. \"We deny all legal wrongdoing and look forward to asserting our counterclaims.\"A tech rivalry for the agesRippling's lawsuit, which demands a jury trial, marks a fiery escalation in its rivalry with Deel.Founded in 2016 by Parker Conrad, a mainstay of the workforce software market, Rippling creates tools to streamline a company's back office. It launched with the idea of gathering all of a customer's data about its employees and placing it in one system.Deel came onto the scene with a different proposition. In 2019, the company functioned as an \"employer of record\" for companies, allowing its customers to hire globally without having to worry about compliance regulations in different countries. Over time, Deel, led by founder Alex Bouaziz, bolted a wider range of products onto its system, building them in-house and buying up small players in payroll and IT.The two firms now go head-to-head in the workforce software market, raising bigger and faster rounds of funding to expand their operations.Their competition has often unfolded in the public eye. Last spring, when Rippling held a tender offer, which refers to the sale of a shareholder's stock in a company, the company barred former employees who work for its competitors, including Deel, from cashing out.In January, a class action complaint alleged Deel processed payments without the proper licenses related to a Ponzi scheme. The plaintiff's lawyer, Thomas Grady, has been reported to be an investor in Rippling. In a motion to dismiss, Deel denied any wrongdoing and chalked up the complaint as a feckless attack by its biggest competitor.A court order and a flushing toiletRippling said it picked up the alleged corporate spy's trail partly by looking at his Slack activity. The employee, who joined Rippling in 2023, had rarely used the \"preview\" function on Slack, which allows users to view a channel's contents without notifying colleagues, the lawsuit says.In November 2024, the lawsuit says, the employee started previewing dozens of channels a month, sometimes peeking at particular channels more than 100 times each month.The channels were dedicated to information about Rippling's services and software sales, as well as information about competitors like Deel, the lawsuit says.Rippling's lawsuit alleges the employee's browser and email history indicate he may have also met with Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz and Global Head of Expasion Olivier Elbaz in December.On Wednesday, after the honeypot operation, Rippling sought a court order in Ireland to seize and inspect the alleged spy's phone.When a court-appointed solicitor served the employee with the order at Rippling's Dublin office, the employee said his phone was in a bag on another floor.It was a lie, the lawsuit alleged.\"The bag only contained a notebook. It held no mobile device,\" the lawsuit says.The spy then went to the bathroom and locked the door, \"despite the independent solicitor's repeated warnings that these actions were in violation of the court order,\" the lawsuit says.\"I'm willing to take that risk,\" the employee said, according to the lawsuit.The employee \"then stormed out of the office and fled the scene,\" the lawsuit says.Rippling says in the lawsuit the solicitor heard the employee flush the toilet, suggesting he \"may have attempted to flush his phone down the toilet rather than provide it for inspection,\" though a later inspection of the building's plumbing \"did not locate any mobile devices.\"Have a tip?

Just hours after Rippling sent the letter, the spy searched for and accessed the channel, the lawsuit alleges.It was a \"smoking gun\" that Deel's highest echelon — or someone working on its behalf — fed information to the alleged spy, Rippling said in the lawsuit.Over the course of four",

        "description": "Tariffs have caused lots of headaches for business owners around the world, especially as they’ve become a hot topic in the political landscape. Just this week, President Donald Trump enacted 25% import taxes on Mexican and Canadian goods, causing the S&P 500 to plummet. Businesses struggling with these complex tariffs may have a newfound appreciation for a tool that promises to simplify the process: Agentforce, Salesforce’s AI-powered agent platform that was launched in October 2024. Agentforce enables users to create AI agents that can analyze and make decisions based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, a 4,400-plus page document that sets tariff rates for over 20,000 imported items. Agentforce users can create an “Import Specialist Agent” that will analyze the lengthy schedule and will automatically adjust pricing or create business plans accordingly. What once took businesses months to adapt to can now be handled in minutes, according to Paul Tatum, Salesforce’s EVP of Solution Engineering. Tatum tells Fast Company that the Import Specialist Agent is one of the many ways that AI can make convoluted, labor-intensive tasks easier. “Governments around the world are overworked and outstretched,” says Tatum. “Technology has helped with that over the years, but digital labor is going to transform the level of service and capabilities of the government.” The Import Specialist Agent responds to each business’s unique data, taking into account the size of a business, what products it sells, and previous sales history. This technology is applicable across the board for small businesses, large businesses, and government employees, says Tatum. Since 2018, the schedule has been updated around 11–30 times each year. Changing policies and pricing to align with each individual schedule change can be a laborious process without the help of AI, Tatum says. And although other AI software exists that can analyze the tariff schedule, Salesforce’s may be the only one that can automatically take action that fits a business’s specific needs, says Tatum. “A lot of the AI technology focus has been around developing large language models, and you see those come out every day. They’re an important part of the puzzle,” Tatum says. “But we believe that the most impactful part of the puzzle is making agents practical, like a digital employee working alongside and augmenting your human employee.” Agentforce currently has about 3,000 paying customers who have created over 5,000 unique AI agents for different purposes—with the Import Specialist Agent being just one of the many. Customers pay $2 per conversation, but this pricing sometimes will vary based on the scale and complexity of the work being performed, according to Salesforce. The tariff schedule isn’t the only lengthy government document that Tatum wants to see Agentforce tackle. He says these capabilities can be transferred to parse through dense language surrounding social security or Medicare. Government documentation is thorough, but often impenetrable, Tatum says. “I open up the IRS website and say: ‘What in the world is going on?’” he adds. “This is where digital employees can help us.",

        "description": "You.com is one potential dark horse in the contest to take on Google as the dominant search engine. Richard Socher believes we're still years from achieving AGI.You.comRichard Socher, a one-time AI boss at Salesforce, is building a search competitor to Google.Socher says Google's search monopoly is under threat as users are now eager to try alternatives.You.com is a potential dark horse in the contest to supersede Google Search.In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, the once unassailable dominance of tech giants like Google is being challenged, says Richard Socher, founder and CEO of You.com.Socher runs a competitor to Google that's built for knowledge workers. Established as a search engine, You.com has expanded its repertoire over the years by incorporating digital agents for writing essays, browsing the web, and other tasks. To date, the company has raised about $100 million in funding.In an interview with Business Insider, Socher expressed a belief that the era of a single company maintaining an overwhelming, long-lasting monopoly in the tech industry, similar to what Google experienced in the search domain, is coming to an end.Socher said users are now more inclined to explore new, artificial intelligence-charged options and switch between services more readily than in the past.\"This sort of insane, untouchable monopoly that Google had for 20 years, those days are over,\" Socher said. \"I don't think any company will have such a strong monopoly for such a long time anymore because users are getting faster to switch and more eager to try out things.\"This change in user behavior would imply that companies, even those with significant market power, can no longer rely on maintaining a monopoly based solely on inertia or default settings. Instead, these companies must continuously innovate and provide genuine value to retain their user base.Meanwhile, new entrants and smaller players like You.com are seizing an opportunity to pick up users who are open to exploring alternatives.Since launching in 2021, You.com says it has reached \"millions\" of people. The platform is free to use, with premium features available through a $15 monthly plan. You.com also provides enterprise customers with a toolkit designed to bring real-time web search and accuracy to their own applications.The company tells Business Insider its revenue has skyrocketed since the beginning of 2024, reaching 100 times the amount earned the previous year.You.com cofounders Bryan McCann and Richard Socher.You.comBefore he took on Google Search, Socher founded a deep-learning company called MetaMind that he sold to Salesforce. He became chief scientist at Salesforce, where he led the company's research efforts and worked on bringing natural language processing and computer vision to its platform.In 2018, while at Salesforce, Socher published a paper alongside Bryan McCann, a fellow Salesforce research scientist, on multitask learning — a method in machine learning where a model is trained to perform multiple tasks at the same time. The paper influenced subsequent research in the field, with Dario Amodei and Ilya Sutskever citing it in a paper from their lab, OpenAI, a year later.The research also seeded an idea for a new kind of search engine. Socher remembered thinking, \"If you can have one neural network that answers all of your questions, why am I still going to Google where I get these lists of blue links?\" In 2020, he and McCann left Salesforce to start You.com. Marc Benioff wrote one of the first checks.The future of search is still up for grabs, and Socher will have more to contend with than Google. Companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are locked in a contest to offer the most popular chat-based search engine, and ChatGPT's hundreds of millions of active users make You.com's user base look feeble. Additionally, OpenAI has considered developing a web browser, The Information reported, while Perplexity has teased a web browser called Comet, which could provide more seamless and integrated user experiences.In this environment, the real winners of search will be those who anticipate the next big shift and are nimble enough to lead it. As Socher put it, \"I made peace with the fact that AI will just keep changing. We'll have to move quickly.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "TESTINGIn a Deloitte survey, 26% of leaders said their organizations were seriously exploring autonomous agents.ServiceNow, SAP, and Salesforce are among the firms that have debuted AI agents to do work tasks.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.When clients of the cloud-based-software provider ServiceNow contact the company's customer support center, 80% of the cases — in the form of calls and chat messages — are handled without any human intervention.Instead, the company relies on analytical and generative artificial intelligence — in the form of AI agents — to address common customer questions.Chris Bedi, ServiceNow's chief customer officer and enterprise-AI advisor, said employees still handle one out of every five customer-support requests.They're getting new support from agentic AI, which can automate tasks such as drafting a response email to a customer. Workers remain in the loop for a final sign-off before any agentic-AI actions are executed. The combination of human workers and agentic AI shrank the amount of time it took to handle the more complex cases by 52% in a two-week period, ServiceNow said.OpenAI's cofounder Sam Altman and other leading technologists have said that 2025 will be the year that AI agents \"join\" the workforce.In addition to ServiceNow, software developers such as Salesforce and SAP have rolled out their own agentic-AI platforms. These can perform workplace tasks such as processing customer invoices, providing customer support to clients, and drafting emails. The business software giant Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks, began rolling out agentic-AI capabilities in December.Humans mostly remain in the loop for now, but vendors anticipate this technology will become fully autonomous. Multiagent systems, where two or more AI agents collaborate to complete work, will proliferate.\"Agents are the next level of understanding around how you apply AI,\" Jim Rowan, the head of AI at the consultancy Deloitte, said. \"It can perform actions for you.\"In a recent Deloitte survey of 2,773 business leaders, 26% of respondents said their organizations were exploring autonomous agents to a \"large or very large extent.\"Why AI agents have become the new focus for generative AIFor the first two years of the generative-AI boom — which kicked off after the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 — most businesses that adopted the technology scaled it to power chatbots and complete routine tasks like drafting meeting summaries. AI agents represent an evolution of generative-AI technology, built to complete tasks autonomously, though most are still monitored closely by workers.Agentic AI \"actually possesses some unique skills around reasoning, planning, and orchestration,\" Bedi told Business Insider. \"These agents can collaborate with each other and really start to deliver on the promise of work happening autonomously.\"Buzz for AI agents kicked into high gear after Salesforce debuted Agentforce in September to automate tasks in customer support, sales, and marketing. The company has said it will roll out 1 billion agents to customers by the end of this year. The company also reported that more than 340,000 of its customer support questions had been answered autonomously with Agentforce.ServiceNow estimates that the company's AI agents, already deployed in various parts of the business, such as customer service, human resources, and IT, are driving an estimated $325 million in annualized value by bolstering workplace productivity by 20%. ServiceNow says AI-agent-supported work saves 400,000 labor hours annually.Still, technology companies are in the early stages of their agentic-AI development. Many are figuring out which processes they can fully automate with the technology. As a result, company leaders implementing agentic AI are training their workers to collaborate with — and provide feedback on — their new \"coworkers.\"AI agents are often developed as worker-collaboration toolsJohn Kucera, the senior vice president of product management at Salesforce, recommended that businesses be transparent about what work AI agents can handle and what will remain with workers. He added that businesses should be clear about what an AI agent actually is, saying that not all agentic systems are equal.\"There's a lot of false agents out there,\" Kucera said. \"It's only an agent when you're taking a request and the agent is figuring out what to do and then what data to put in.\"While surveys frequently find that many workers worry that AI will replace them, technologists say AI agents won't replace people but assume responsibility for mundane tasks.\"These agents are going to help me do my job, but at no point will they make me do something I'm not aware of,\" said Walter Sun, the global head of AI at SAP, which sells software for financial, supply chain, and other business management needs. \"The most important thing is that the employees are always in control.\"How companies are tailoring AI agents with employee feedbackTo ensure workers have a voice in how AI agents are developed, SAP encourages employees across its various business lines — including the travel- and expense-management provider Concur and SuccessFactors, which provides HR, payroll, and talent management software — to use an internal online form to reach out to the AI team and propose compelling agentic use cases.At Intuit, the AI-powered financial assistant Intuit Assist can get businesses paid 45% faster by detecting past-due invoices and automatically drafting a personalized reminder note. After a business owner approves the note's language and sends it out, they are paid, on average, five days sooner than with a human-only process, Intuit Assist said.But before Inuit Assist takes action, humans have the final say. \"What we're trying to do is have the right human-automation interaction,\" Ashok Srivastava, Intuit's chief data officer, said.Intuit has embraced a robust AI-training program, focused on responsible AI and what the technology can and cannot do, and built a \"sandbox\" called GenStudio that allows employees to interact with large language models in a secure environment. The company has also developed educational programs tailored to senior executives, directors, and engineers. \"It's very pervasive across the company,\" Srivastava added.Asana, which makes work-management software, launched AI agents in October, focusing on a few functions, including marketing, IT, HR, and research and development. Rather than track a specific number of actions that agentic AI takes over, Asana monitors the types of work that can be automated, eliminating the drudgery of busy work to allow employees to focus on more complex tasks.The company is also keeping a close eye on which tasks AI systems get wrong compared with people. In cybersecurity, human errors tend to occur later in the day, when workers are tired after a long shift. AI doesn't get tired, but it is susceptible to hallucinations — or when an AI model generates a response that is misleading or false information but nonetheless presents it as fact. For example, Asana's AI agent might respond to certain questions by suggesting tasks that are, in reality, nonexistent to a particular workflow.\"The kinds of errors we see are different, so the way we fix them needs to be different,\" Asana's chief information security officer, Sean Cassidy, said. He said the company conducts automated tests to detect hallucinations and improve the product when they occur.For AI agents to create a compelling return on investment for the companies that implement them, Deloitte's Rowan said, workers should be tasked with frequently checking on simple automated tasks before any agentic AI actions are taken.If businesses want to see big returns on their agentic AI investment, they need to place AI at the center of their work model, and then consider how humans will engage with the work, Rowan said. If not, \"the savings really won't be there,\" he added.ServiceNow's Bedi said the success of AI agents depends on companies nailing three factors: New agentic capabilities should be developed for each department and its specific needs, unique training plans should be designed for every part of the business — like finance, marketing, and sales — and the value and return on of agentic workflows should be closely monitored.\"The companies that combine all three of those ingredients are going to have a competitive advantage,\" Bedi said.Read the original article on Business Insider TESTINGIn a Deloitte survey, 26% of leaders said their organizations were seriously exploring autonomous agents.ServiceNow, SAP, and Salesforce are among the firms that have debuted AI agents to do work tasks.This article is part of \"AI in Action,\" a series exploring how companies are implementing AI innovations.When clients of the cloud-based-software provider ServiceNow contact the company's customer support center, 80% of the cases — in the form of calls and chat messages — are handled without any human intervention.Instead, the company relies on analytical and generative artificial intelligence — in the form of AI agents — to address common customer questions.Chris Bedi, ServiceNow's chief customer officer and enterprise-AI advisor, said employees still handle one out of every five customer-support requests.They're getting new support from agentic AI, which can automate tasks such as drafting a response email to a customer.

Job postings are well off levels seen during the pandemic, when the industry was awash in openings.In early to mid-2022, there were three times as many software engineering roles listed on job boards, data from Indeed show.Artificial intelligence is surely one cause. The same technology that can make coders more productive appears to be undercutting hiring demand.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said the tech giant might not hire any engineers in 2025 because AI tools allow Salesforce engineers to do so much more.\"We have seen such incredible productivity gains because of the agents that work side by side with our engineers,\" Benioff said on the \"The Logan Bartlett Show\" podcast in January.'Am I going to lose my job?'Productivity gains are great news for coders with jobs, yet the AI boost can be worrisome for job seekers.A year ago, the startup Cognition Labs released what it said was the first AI software engineer. The company, backed by Peter Thiel's venture capital fund, caused a stir with its announcement.\"There was a lot of panic. I had a lot of friends of mine who messaged me and said, 'Hey, am I going to lose my job?'\" Jesal Gadhia, head of engineering at Thoughtful AI, which creates AI tools for healthcare providers, previously told Business Insider.He worries that even though coders are still needed in many areas, AI could step into roles that have long served as training grounds for junior engineers.\"Junior engineers,\" Gadhia said, \"have a little bit of a target behind their back.\"Demand is likely to growIt's not all bad news for those with strong technical chops. In late August, the US government's Bureau of Labor Statistics forecast that demand for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers would grow 17% from 2023 to 2033. That's far faster than the growth in the overall job market, the agency noted.Lighthouse Labs, a Canadian company offering coding boot camps, said in January that global demand for skilled workers in data analytics, cybersecurity, and cloud computing is outstripping supply. No surprise, some of the biggest gains involve AI. Lighthouse Labs said that's partly because there is demand for people with skills in areas like machine learning well beyond the tech industry itself.AI to do more of the workRegardless of industry, demands on coders' time will likely continue to evolve because of AI. GitLab has said developers already only spend about a quarter of their time coding.Madars Biss, a tech writer and frontend developer, previously told BI that he expects developers to spend less time generating code and more time managing AI-generated code.AI tools could \"handle much of the routine and repetitive tasks of the developer, and humans focus on managing, double-checking, and creativity,\" Biss said.As with Salesforce, that could change how companies hire software engineers.In June, Amazon Web Services chief Matt Garman predicted that AI could handle a good deal of coders' work, according to a recording of the discussion previously obtained by BI.\"If you go forward 24 months from now, or some amount of time — I can't exactly predict where it is — it's possible that most developers are not coding,\" Garman said.Read the original article on Business Insider Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has said the company might not hire any engineers in 2025 because of productivity gains from artificial intelligence.Brontë Wittpenn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty ImagesJob openings for software engineers are at their lowest level in five years, Indeed data show.Marc Benioff said Salesforce might not hire software engineers in 2025 because of gains from AI.Despite AI's impact, demand for skilled tech workers is expected to grow significantly by 2033.If you're a coder, you already know: There just aren't as many jobs as there used to be.Openings for software engineers in the US are down by more than one-third from five years ago.For many engineers, the dropoff likely feels even steeper. Job postings are well off levels seen during the pandemic, when the industry was awash in openings.In early to mid-2022, there were three times as many software engineering roles listed on job boards, data from Indeed show.Artificial intelligence is surely one cause. The same technology that can make coders more productive appears to be undercutting hiring demand.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said the tech giant might not hire any engineers in 2025 because AI tools allow Salesforce engineers to do so much more.\"We have seen such incredible productivity gains because of the agents that work side by side with our engineers,\" Benioff said on the \"The Logan Bartlett Show\" podcast in January.'Am I going to lose my job?'Productivity gains are great news for coders with jobs, yet the AI boost can be worrisome for job seekers.A year ago, the startup Cognition Labs released what it said was the first AI software engineer. The company, backed by Peter Thiel's venture capital fund, caused a stir with its announcement.\"There was a lot of panic. I had a lot of friends of mine who messaged me and said, 'Hey, am I going to lose my job?'\" Jesal Gadhia, head of engineering at Thoughtful AI, which creates AI tools for healthcare providers, previously told Business Insider.He worries that even though coders are still needed in many areas, AI could step into roles that have long served as training grounds for junior engineers.\"Junior engineers,\" Gadhia said, \"have a little bit of a target behind their back.\"Demand is likely to growIt's not all bad news for those with strong technical chops. In late August, the US government's Bureau of Labor Statistics forecast that demand for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers would grow 17% from 2023 to 2033. That's far faster than the growth in the overall job market, the agency noted.Lighthouse Labs, a Canadian company offering coding boot camps, said in January that global demand for skilled workers in data analytics, cybersecurity, and cloud computing is outstripping supply. No surprise, some of the biggest gains involve AI.
