Citigroup and Carlyle Group have reportedly joined forces to fund FinTech companies. [contact-form-7] As Bloomberg News reported Thursday (June 12), the companies have signed an agreement that lets them jointly invest in growing companies and the assets those companies originate, like consumer loans. The report noted that private credit outfits have been seeking ways to carve out a greater slice of the $5.2 trillion asset-backed finance market, which involves debt backed by contractual cash flows stemming from defined pools of assets, such as mortgages or auto loans. According to the report, the agreement lets Carlyle and Citi invest side-by-side in these startups, whether that’s through private debt or equity investments, and one day arrange their public asset-backed bonds. Carlyle will team with Citi’s venture investing team Spread Products Investment in Technologies, (SPRINT) which specializes in FinTech investments. “As these FinTech companies mature, they seek financing across both private and public markets,” Akhil Bansal, head of asset-backed finance at Carlyle, told Bloomberg. “With Carlyle’s ability to provide private capital financing and Citi’s to arrange public securitizations, we plan on covering their financing needs over their lifetime.” The report noted that this agreement is the third Citi has made with an asset manager in the last 18 months to bolster its private credit holdings. The banking giant has formed similar pacts with Apollo Global Management and LuminArx Capital Management. “AI is changing the FinTech space. These new specialty lenders are coming to us to grow,” said Rajiv Amlani, global head of private markets coverage at Citi. “Banks and private credit firms can work together and this is a prime example of it.” The partnership comes at a time when younger consumers are increasingly turning to FinTechs for their financial needs, as PYMNTS wrote earlier this week. Recent PYMNTS research finds that 54% of Generation Z individuals depend primarily on non-traditional financial service providers, “valuing real-time payouts and companies aligning with their social values,” that report said. This shift has left FinTechs, as well as large banks and credit unions, adjusting their strategies to appeal to Gen Z. “They want products aligned with their values, aligned with their lifestyle, and they want to be digitally present,” said Gavin Michael, CEO of digital-only Varo Bank, during a recent panel discussion with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. For Varo, catering to Gen Z involves flexibility and transparency through products like Varo Advance, which provides short-term cash advances, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered line of credit. “We’re underwriting these products based on cash flow, not traditional credit histories,” Michael added, stressing tailored offerings that match Gen Z’s lifestyle demands.

Citigroup is reportedly preparing for a potential decline in consumer financial health by putting aside more provisions for credit losses. [contact-form-7] “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million,” Citigroup Head of Banking Vis Raghavan said Tuesday (June 10) at a conference hosted by Morgan Stanley, according to a Bloomberg report. This move was not expected by analysts, according to the report. Among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the consensus was that Citi’s provisions for credit losses would decline from $2.72 billion in the first quarter to $2.69 billion in the second quarter. According to the report, Raghavan said at the conference that he remains reassured by Citi’s broader credit exposure. The report said Citi’s retail banking business tends to serve consumers with higher credit scores. “We still have a few more weeks to go in this quarter, but on the credit overall, I’m incredibly reassured of the quality,” Raghavan said. PYMNTS reported in April that major credit card companies had growing concern regarding the economy, with delinquencies on the rise and reaching levels similar to those before the pandemic. In response, these companies were taking proactive measures to prepare for a downturn, including tightening lending practices and setting aside funds to cover potential losses. It was reported in March that automotive repossessions jumped in 2024 to the highest level in 15 years, signaling that Americans were having trouble staying on top of their monthly bills due to steep interest rates and higher car prices. Car repossession numbers plunged during the pandemic due to relief efforts for borrowers, but began to climb when those measures ended and inflation jumped, leaving borrowers struggling to repay auto loans. During earnings reports delivered in April, three of the nation’s largest financial institutions — Citigroup, PNC and Bank of America — reported that, at least for now, the U.S. consumer remains on strong footing. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said at the time that card portfolios showed “elevated” but still manageable levels of credit losses, aligned with an environment in which rising interest rates and inflation had begun to pinch certain segments of consumers.

Citigroup is reportedly preparing for a possible decline in consumer financial health by putting aside more provisions for potential losses on loans. [contact-form-7] “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million,” Citigroup Head of Banking Vis Raghavan said Tuesday (June 10) at a conference hosted by Morgan Stanley, according to a Bloomberg report. Raghavan added that the bank’s credit reserve build changes frequently based on its outlook. This move was not expected by analysts and reflects a cautious approach, according to the report. Among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the consensus was that Citi’s provisions for credit losses would decline from $2.72 billion in the first quarter to $2.69 billion in the second quarter. According to the report, Raghavan said at the conference that he remains reassured by Citi’s broader credit exposure. The report said Citi’s retail banking business tends to serve consumers with higher credit scores. “We still have a few more weeks to go in this quarter, but on the credit overall, I’m incredibly reassured of the quality,” Raghavan said. PYMNTS reported in April that major credit card companies had growing concern regarding the economy, with delinquencies on the rise and reaching levels similar to those before the pandemic. In response, these companies were taking proactive measures to prepare for a downturn, including tightening lending practices and setting aside funds to cover potential losses. It was reported in March that automotive repossessions jumped in 2024 to the highest level in 15 years, signaling that Americans were having trouble staying on top of their monthly bills due to steep interest rates and higher car prices. Car repossession numbers plunged during the pandemic due to relief efforts for borrowers, but began to climb when those measures ended and inflation jumped, leaving borrowers struggling to repay auto loans. During earnings reports delivered in April, three of the nation’s largest financial institutions — Citigroup, PNC and Bank of America — reported that, at least for now, the U.S. consumer remains on strong footing. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said at the time that card portfolios showed “elevated” but still manageable levels of credit losses, aligned with an environment in which rising interest rates and inflation had begun to pinch certain segments of consumers.

Not to be confused with the Citi Strata Premier℠ Card, this card is relaunching as the Citi Strata℠ Card* in summer 2025 and will slide seamlessly into Citi’s ThankYou Points line with fantastic new earning opportunities. Citi is a Forbes Advisor partner. Citi Strata Card—Impressive Earning Rates With No Annual Fee While there’s no shortage of no-annual-fee rewards cards on the market, the Strata card will stand out for its varied bonus categories. Cardholders will earn: 5X ThankYou points per dollar spent on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked through Citi Travel 3X points at supermarkets, select transit and at gas and EV charging stations 3X points on an eligible self-select category of your choice, such as fitness clubs, select streaming services, live entertainment, cosmetic stores or pet stores 2x points at restaurants 1X point on all other eligible purchases The self-select categories include your choice of fitness clubs, select streaming services, live entertainment, cosmetic stores (including barber shops and hair salons) and pet supply stores. A Citi representative confirmed that there are no spending caps in this or other categories. Most other credit cards with custom earning categories have spending limits, which makes the Strata stand out. Citi Rewards+ Cards To Be Converted to Strata Cards If you currently hold a Citi Rewards+® Card*, it will automatically be converted to a Citi Strata℠ Card* on July 20, 2025. For most customers, the new earning rates will be a major upgrade. However, one of the Rewards+ card’s most loved benefits was the ability to receive a rebate worth 10% of your redeemed points (up to 100,000 points per year). Unfortunately, that benefit will disappear when the Rewards+ is fully phased out. The new Strata card doesn’t have any major headlining perks, though it will be eligible for standard World Elite Mastercard benefits. Combining Multiple Citi Credit Cards The Citi Strata℠ Card* will serve many people well as a stand-alone card, but customers willing to juggle multiple cards can maximize their earnings potential in several spending categories and then combine ThankYou Points into a single account for ultimate flexibility when redeeming. Any or all of these cards could make excellent companions for the Strata: Citi Double Cash® Card: Earn 2% cash back on all purchases—1% when purchases are made and another 1% when they’re paid off, and earn 5% total cash back on hotel, car rentals and attractions booked with Citi Travel, making this card a good option for transactions that aren’t treated as bonus categories on the Strata. Citi Custom Cash® Card*: Earn 5% cash back on purchases in a top eligible spend category up to the first $500 spent each billing cycle, 4% cash back on hotels, car rentals, and attractions booked on Citi Travel portal through 6/30/2026 and 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Custom Cash features different purchase categories than the Strata, such as home improvement and drugstores. Citi Strata Premier℠ Card: Offering overlapping earnings in some categories (such as 3X in groceries and gas), this $95-per-year card increases your earnings potential on other types of purchases, particularly travel. The Strata card won’t accept applications until later this summer, but you can apply for any of the above cards now. However, keep in mind that Citi typically only approves applicants for a maximum of two cards in a rolling 65-day period, so if you hope to obtain multiple cards, you may need to spread out your applications over time. Bottom Line Whether you’re a current Rewards+ cardholder or looking for a powerful no-annual-fee credit card, the Citi Strata℠ Card* is poised to become a serious contender in the rewards card landscape. Offering triple rewards in a large breadth of categories—including one category of your choice—the upcoming Strata card offers a compelling way to maximize your ThankYou Points and rethink your wallet.",

Citi Handlowy, a Polish banking business that is majority-owned by a Citigroup subsidiary, plans to sell its consumer banking business to VeloBank S.A., a Poland-based universal bank. The transaction, which is expected to close by mid-2026, subject to customary conditions, is the latest of the sales and wind downs of international consumer businesses announced by Citi as part of its strategic refresh, Citi said in a Tuesday (May 27) press release. The deal does not include Citi Handlowy’s institutional businesses, which Citi Handlowy will continue to invest in and grow, according to the release. “This transaction enables us to deploy additional resources to our institutionally focused businesses, so we can continue to connect corporations in Poland to our global network,” Citi Head of International Ernesto Torres Cantú said in the release. “We’re proud of this significant milestone in simplifying our firm, and we’re pleased that our consumer banking colleagues in Poland are going to a buyer that will continue to invest in this great franchise.” Citi’s last significant remaining international consumer operation is Grupo Financiero Banamex in Mexico, and the bank continues to work on a proposed initial public offering for that business, per the release. Citi said in May 2023 that it had decided to take Banamex public after exiting the consumer banking market in Mexico in 2022. “After careful consideration, we concluded the optimal path to maximizing the value of Banamex for our shareholders and advancing our goal to simplify our firm is to pivot from our dual path approach to focus solely on an IPO of the business,” Citi CEO Jane Fraser said at the time in a press release. Citi announced in January 2022 that it was making changes to its business structure as part of a broader strategy to move away from global retail banking. At that time, Citi said it was closing its Mexican retail banking arm, Citibanamex, and selling consumer banks in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. It retained its institutional businesses. “Now, to be clear, these are terrific,” Fraser said during a January 2022 earnings call. “They’re scaled high returning franchises, but our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths.” The post Citi to Sell Polish Consumer Banking Business Amid ‘Strategic Refresh’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Each week, the evolution of the ongoing cryptocurrency-FinTech convergence seems to get another headline to hang its hat on. Last week, it was the news Thursday (May 22) that J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin. This week, it is the news Tuesday (May 27) that Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Circle is hoping for a valuation of $5.65 billion with an offering price target of $24 to $26 per share. The lead underwriters are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Circle is betting that the credibility conferred by becoming a public company will help the company in a financial environment skeptical of opaque crypto firms. Transparency is a key pillar of Circle’s pitch to institutional clients as outlined in its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By going public, Circle will subject itself to the scrutiny of U.S. securities laws, quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, all elements designed to engender trust from risk-averse enterprises, banks and governments. Circle’s goal for its IPO is to position itself favorably to become the financial utility layer of the internet. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) for money movement or a SWIFT network reimagined for digital assets. To get there, Circle may need to evolve beyond being a stablecoin issuer. Elements such as programmable money services, secure identity layers, robust compliance automation and user-friendly APIs could be crucial since institutional trust is hard-won and easily lost. See also: Keeping Stablecoins Stable is Complicated: Why CFOs Need to Pay Attention Stablecoin Competition Is Getting Crowded The stablecoin arena is no longer the wild frontier it once was. Circle must now contend with legacy finance and FinTech upstarts. PayPal launched PYUSD, and traditional banking consortia are mulling their own. Tether remains the volume leader globally, especially outside the United States. Circle’s edge lies in its U.S.-compliant stance and focus on transparency and fiat backing. But whether that will be enough to ward off better capitalized or more broadly distributed competitors is uncertain. The potential IPO valuation and capital war chest may help, but only if Circle is able to move quickly to entrench itself as the preferred partner for enterprises. Circle’s S-1 offers insight into its revenue model, revealing an interest-sensitive business. In 2024, the company earned $1.68 billion in total revenue, with 99% of that coming from interest income on reserves backing USDC. That figure underscores how tightly Circle’s fortunes could be tied to interest rate policy. As a practical matter, Circle earns this income by parking USDC reserves in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The downside is that if interest rates fall, so too does Circle’s revenue. According to its filing, a 1% drop in rates could slash income by as much as $441 million. Stablecoins have started to decouple themselves from crypto exchanges and position themselves as a component of real-world financial infrastructure, PYMNTS reported in March. Additionally, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high amid strong performance across crypto sectors in April. Read also: Smaller Banks Face Urgent Crypto Decisions Regulation Remains Crypto’s Looming Wildcard Circle’s IPO plans can also be seen as a part of a broader movement among other major crypto firms seeking to capitalize on a more pro-crypto, pro-business regulatory climate under the President Donald Trump administration. The SEC, for example, said it is eying regulatory changes to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, the country’s first stablecoin legislation, is proceeding through the Senate amid recognition in Washington that stablecoins are too big to ignore. Still, the GENIUS Act could include a provision prohibiting interest-bearing stablecoins. The Circle S-1 flags multiple legal risks, but chief among them is the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins. To diversify its business model, Circle this month brought the Circle Payments Network (CPN) live. Designed to facilitate the use of stablecoins for mainstream cross-border payments, the network and coordination protocol enables financial institutions to exchange payment instructions and settle transactions on open, public blockchains. Early adopters of CPN include Alfred Pay, which is using the network to enable stablecoin-to-fiat offramps via PIX and SPEI; Tazapay, which is using it to support compliant fiat disbursements into Hong Kong; RedotPay, which is using the network to initiate USDC-based payments into Brazil; and Conduit, which is using it to onramp fiat into USDC in the U.S. and Europe to support B2B flows into Mexico.

Citi has debuted its PayTo initiator, a payment solution for its institutional clients. PayTo lets clients access what Citi calls a “faster, cost-effective, and more secure” alternative to credit cards, debit cards or direct debits, per a Tuesday (May 20) press release. With PayTo, those “clients can initiate account-to-account pull payments,” the bank said in a news release. “This means clients’ customers can pay directly from their bank account, in real-time, enabling a transparent and instant process for clients.” According to the release, PayTo offers Citi clients seamless reconciliation and reduced fees as it lessens reliance on card fees and decreases the likelihood of chargebacks. The tool can be used for transactions including in-app payments or eCommerce payments, outsourced payroll, utility bills, flight bookings, subscriptions and digital wallet top-ups. “Our clients want smarter payments solutions, and PayTo is a cost-effective, transparent and secure solution,” Citi Australia and New Zealand Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Services Kirstin Renner said in the release. “Through PayTo, we’re truly giving our clients access to the future of payments. We anticipate strong take-up of this offer as clients welcome the benefits for themselves and their end customer. As we progress toward an increasingly 24/7, digital-led economy, we are focused on delivering innovations for our clients that will keep them at the forefront of technological change in payments.” In related news, PYMNTS wrote recently about the relatively untapped potential of open banking payments, noting that research suggests that the proper incentives could open the door to widespread consumer adoption. The collaboration between PYMNTS Intelligence and Trustly, titled “What Consumers Need for Pay by Bank to Catch On,” examines U.S. consumers’ current awareness of and inclination towards making pay by bank/open banking payments. The study found that strategic incentives, especially discounts and cash-back offers, significantly boost interest even among those initially resistant to the idea. The report highlights that while current usage remains modest, future growth depends on effectively targeting key demographics and underscoring the applicability of pay by bank beyond traditional retail transactions. “The report identifies a significant awareness gap as a primary hurdle, with 56% of consumers stating they are simply not familiar with pay by bank,” PYMNTS wrote. “However, the research highlights the power of incentives in bridging this gap, demonstrating a 72% increase in interest when consumers are offered cash-back discounts or loyalty benefits.” The post Citi Introduces Account-to-Account Payment Tool PayTo appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

A more multipolar system of trade and capital could emerge from the current disruptions caused by tariffs, Citi CEO Jane Fraser wrote in a Friday (May 16) blog post. Tariffs have disrupted trust, supply lines and planning cycles, and their impact will take time to settle even if the tariffs are eased, according to the post. “We are entering a new phase of globalization — one less defined by cooperation, and more by strategic self-interest,” Fraser wrote. “Long-held assumptions are being challenged, not just by tariff announcements but by a deeper confidence shock.” This shift requires businesses to focus on resilience, risk and “rewiring global strategies for a more dynamic world,” Fraser wrote. Amid the current uncertainty, companies are pausing decisions, delaying capital expenditures, holding off on hiring, and preparing for changes among their customers and suppliers, according to the post. To avoid tariffs, some companies are shifting production to the U.S. or lower-tariff markets, using their existing dual-sourcing capabilities or accelerating their purchases, per the post. “If current headwinds persist, global growth could slow by as much as a point,” Fraser wrote. “U.S. inflation could stay stubbornly above the Fed’s target, complicating policy decisions. This is also an opportunity — for countries to invest in infrastructure, education, energy security; to reform, diversify and prepare for a different kind of growth.” Fraser said May 5 that President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda was playing out in three “phases,” with the first being the pull forward of some spending from consumers and corporates, the second being uncertainty regarding decisions on investments and hiring, and the third being finalized tariffs and clarity about their impact on consumer demand. “I think you’ve got to recognize that this is going to play out slow, and we’ve got to keep a perspective and be very mindful about what the longer term looks like amidst all the announcements,” Fraser said at the time. When first quarter earnings were announced in April, Citi was among the large financial institutions that emphasized there was continuing demand from retail customers, underscored by robust credit– and debit-card activity, amid tariff discussions and global economic jitters.

Global FinTech platform iCapital said Tuesday (May 13) that it will acquire Citi’s indirect subsidiary, Citi Global Alternatives. Citi Global Alternatives is the adviser to Citi Wealth’s global alternative investment fund platform, iCapital said in a Tuesday press release. When the transaction is completed, iCapital will manage and operate the fund platform, while Citi will continue to distribute the funds and offer guidance to its clients, according to the release. ICapital also said in the release that it will provide a team dedicated to Citi Wealth that will assist with global sales and service enablement to support the growth of Citi’s alternatives program. “ICapital’s technology platform will streamline the operations and management of their current and future alternative investment funds platform,” iCapital Chairman and CEO Lawrence Calcano said in the release. “Additionally, we will enhance Citi Wealth’s global sales capabilities with a dedicated alternative investment specialist team.” Daniel O’Donnell, head of Citi Wealth Alternatives and Investment Manager Solutions, said in the release: “Citi Wealth already has a strong working relationship with iCapital on alternative solutions, and we’re excited to expand our relationship to bring greater integration of iCapital’s market-leading digital capabilities to our advisers, bankers, investment counselors and clients.” ICapital said in January that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire “reusable financial identity” provider Parallel Markets. The company said the move would enable iCapital to streamline digital identity, investment onboarding and compliance verifications. “Parallel Markets has pioneered software that supports a reusable investor passport, streamlining these duplicative processes for advisers, investors and fund managers,” Calcano said at the time in a press release. “As we continue to evolve our tech stack, we will enhance automated entry for alternative investing and leverage AI and machine learning to offer a complete, intuitive end-to-end solution.” In October, iCapital announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AI-driven technology firm AltExchange. “AltExchange has developed one of the most advanced document retrieval solutions that’s connected to sophisticated mapping, routing technology and LLM [large language model] based document extraction,” Calcano said when announcing the deal in a press release. “This acquisition complements the investments we are making in our internal R&D to further enhance our data management capabilities.” The post ICapital to Acquire Citi Global Alternatives and Collaborate With Citi Wealth appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Could the stablecoin market someday surpass the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem? New regulatory efforts promoting the integration of the dollar-pegged coins into the mainstream economy might soon make that happen, CoinDesk reported Monday (May 12), citing predictions by Citi. Already moving into the payments/remittances space, stablecoins will likely replace some overseas and domestic U.S. currency holdings, the report said, pointing to a recent report from Citi Institute’s Future Finance think-tank. “We’re looking at the integration of stablecoins into what you call the mainstream economy,” Ronit Ghose, the global head of the think tank, told CoinDesk. “For example, stablecoins could be the cash leg for tokenized financial assets, or for payments by SMEs and large corporates. The dollar, and to a lesser extent the euro, has this kind of international currency status. Stablecoins allow people all over the world to hold dollars or euros in an easy, low-cost way.” The report noted that the current stablecoin market is around $240 billion, most of it from two coins: Tether’s $145 billion USDT and Circle’s $60 billion USDC. Citi’s baseline projection shows the market jumping to $1.6 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory support and institutional integration continue apace. A more optimistic scenario would push the market to $3.7 trillion, a figure that surpasses the current global cryptocurrency market cap of $3.45 trillion. The report also includes comments from Michael Shaulov, CEO of crypto firm Fireblocks, who has witnessed a shift away from the use of stablecoins as a settlement and on/off ramp trading tool and toward payments. “Payment companies represent 11% of all of our clients, but 16% of the overall stablecoin transactions with over 30% growth of Q/Q in volumes. This growth will likely continue, and they will represent 50% of the stablecoin volume within 12 months,” he said. In related news, PYMNTS spoke Monday with Konstantin Anissimov, newly appointed CEO at Currency.com, about the changing stablecoin landscape. “There’s been a big shift in terms of adoption of stablecoin payments that is being driven by uncertainty in geopolitics,” Anissimov told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “I am personally seeing a big increase of small to medium enterprises utilizing stablecoin payments because banking rails are harder and harder to use.” Digital assets are no longer a speculative play for those people who embrace risk, but a tool to navigate a fragmented financial world, he added. “If the payment gets there quicker, faster, in a more definitive way, then a lot of these businesses are limited less in their working capital requirements,” Anissimov said. “The faster the payment, the more goods they can buy.” The post Citi: Stablecoin Market Could Hit $3.7 Trillion By 2030 appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said Monday that most of the Wall Street bank’s business clients believe they can cope with U.S. tariffs of up to 10% on foreign countries, including China, but that levies any higher would make things difficult. Fraser, speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, warned that companies across goods and services were waiting to make investments and hire new employees until they were more certain about the business and economic climate. “If it is 10%, most of the clients we talk to say, ‘Yeah, we can absorb that.’ If it is 25%, not so much,” Fraser said, according to a video uploaded by Bloomberg. The Trump administration has placed duties of 145% on imports from China, the first arrow in a burgeoning trade war between the two nations. Other U.S. levies against most other countries are on a 90-day pause that ends July 9. Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” on May 4 that “at some point” he would lower tariffs on China. Regarding the White House’s fluctuating agenda, Fraser said that Trump’s tariff agenda was playing out in three “phases.” The first, she said, “is the one we’re seeing right now, where we’re seeing the pull forward of some of the spending from the consumers and from corporates.” She referred to but did not specify recent economic data. The U.S economy contracted 0.3% over January through March. The second phase “that’s coming through” revolves around the fact that companies “are in a bit of a limbo land” regarding decisions on investments and hiring. “There’s a wait and see going on at the moment where everyone sees how this will all play through,” Fraser said. The third phase, she added, would be when tariff decisions are finalized and their impact on consumer demand becomes clear. “It’s certainly been a fluid few weeks, and there’s been a lot that’s been coming at us pretty hard and fast in terms of announcements and changes,” she said. “I think you’ve got to recognize that this is going to play out slow, and we’ve got to keep a perspective and be very mindful about what the longer term looks like amidst all the announcements.” But the short term is also a concern, as some companies have suspended their decisions on capital investments or hiring. Those moves, Fraser said, “will have an impact on demand in the economy.” The post Citigroup CEO: US Businesses Delay Investments, Hiring Amid ‘Limbo’ of Tariff Uncertainty appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images; Social Security Administration; Chelsea Jia Feng/BIThe Social Security Administration faces a delicate moment. Its future teeters between a career bureaucrat and a former Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase executive who may bring order — or further tumult.The agency maintains the country's largest safety net. It employs nearly 60,000 federal workers and provides benefits to over 73 million Americans. It has long been seen as untouchable in Washington — \"the third rail of American politics\" — and commissioners rarely leave, even as presidential administrations change.That changed in February, when Michelle King, a 30-year veteran of the agency, abruptly left her role as acting commissioner. In her place, President Donald Trump installed Leland Dudek, an employee who wasn't in the agency's executive ranks.The transition, which came as DOGE staffers accessed internal agency data, one worker's affidavit said, was a sharp departure from typical agency protocol. It \"was a shock to every single person that works at SSA,\" Laura Haltzel, a former Social Security associate commissioner, told Business Insider. It was also a harbinger of the chaos to come.Since then, the White House DOGE office has slashed staff numbers, policy flip-flops have put beneficiaries on edge, Dudek weighed closing the agency based on his understanding of a judge's ruling, and the AARP has said that things may get worse.Meanwhile, Frank Bisignano, a finance titan and formidable turnaround manager, is waiting in the wings as Trump's nominee to replace Dudek. The transition ahead could set the course for how — and how well — millions of Americans receive their benefits.The turnaround agentBisignano, 65, is the chair and CEO of Fiserv, a global fintech giant. He was the second-highest-paid CEO in the US in 2017, when he earned more than $100 million.Some in the industry told BI they see him as a turnaround artist, which could serve him well should he take over the agency.Bisignano's confirmation is awaiting a full Senate vote, which is expected after the chamber votes on nominees for multiple diplomatic positions. He has already appeared before the Senate Finance Committee, where he addressed concerns about privatization. \"I've never thought about privatizing. It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about,\" he told lawmakers.An official on the transition team shepherding Trump's nominees through the confirmation process declined to comment for this story or make Bisignano available for an interview.Some who spoke with BI expressed surprise that he would join the Trump administration. An archived biography from First Data, where he served as chair and CEO, said he's \"a strong supporter of diversity\" and helped create affinity groups for women and LGBTQ+ employees at the company. He's donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, records show. In May 2019, Bisignano gave $125,000 to the Trump Victory PAC and another $83,900 to the Republican National Committee.Frank Bisignano during his confirmation hearing.The Washington Post/Getty ImagesBorn in Brooklyn, with a father who was an orphan and a grandfather who emigrated from Italy, Bisignano first landed on Wall Street in the 1970s. He started out at smaller firms before joining the legendary bankers Sandy Weill and Jamie Dimon as they built what would become Citigroup. There, he managed the company's global transaction services business, helping steer trillions of dollars in payments worldwide.\"He knew enough about the guts of the operations he was involved in to be able to be a very good manager,\" Weill, a former chair and CEO of Citigroup, told BI.Later, he joined JPMorgan Chase, where he reversed multibillion-dollar losses in the firm's mortgage banking unit and rose to become its co-chief operating officer.\"Frank did a very good job in operations for JPMorgan, but I think that he was looking for something where he would be able to test his leadership skills beyond operations,\" Weill said.In 2013, he took over First Data. Its owner at the time, the private equity giant KKR, was seeking a CEO with knowledge of payments and back-office systems. He steered the company through its $2.6 billion initial public offering and its $22 billion sale to Fiserv in 2019; he became Fiserv's CEO the following year. Under his tenure, the company's stock price has roughly doubled.A post on the official White House website in late April touted the \"Trump effect,\" crediting the president for spurring a series of private sector investments in American industry. Among those the administration pointed to: Fiserv's $175 million commitment to develop a 427,000-square-foot fintech campus in Kansas, which is expected to drive the creation of 2,000 jobs.Leland Dudek's turbulent tenureCurrently leading the agency — and seen by some SSA insiders as responsible for much of the recent turmoil — is Dudek, the acting commissioner Trump installed in February.One former senior Social Security official who was familiar with the senior-level employees usually tapped for the role remembered thinking: \"Who is this guy?\" A director-level employee who's on administrative leave told BI that Dudek, 48, was \"a nobody until a month ago.\" (Most of the SSA sources who spoke with BI left within the past few months.)Most recently, Dudek had been serving as a senior advisor in the agency's Office of Program Integrity.Dudek, who holds degrees from the Catholic University of America and the National Defense University, has long been enmeshed in anti-fraud and information technology work. According to an agency biography, he previously served as the chief information security officer for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. He has been with the SSA since 2009, though he does not appear on an organizational chart archived immediately before King's departure.One former manager at SSA who met Dudek when he arrived at the agency said that he \"seemed like a pretty earnest, straightforward kind of computer science IT type who had experience outside the agency.\" Dudek, this person said, was part of a larger group who felt the agency was slow to adopt technological advances.\"He generally seemed to be interested in things running more effectively,\" a former SSA employee said. They described him as being frustrated over \"trying to make change and do things in a bureaucratic environment\" and said other employees at his level felt similarly.Another former SSA executive said they believed he had good intentions and genuinely cared about curbing fraud and improper payments.His path at the agency was not straightforward. Elon Musk said on X that Dudek was \"fired\" for \"helping @DOGE find taxpayer savings\" before he ascended to SSA's highest perch.There, he brought his own style.\"I think he felt like he deserved a voice at the table, and then he suddenly got one and didn't quite know what to do with it,\" the former executive said. The executive added that Dudek appeared to have competing priorities between staff cuts and making sure the agency ran smoothly. \"It's been a bit of a yo-yo,\" they said.\"It's very unusual, very unusual leadership,\" said Kathleen Romig, who worked at the agency for nine years on and off and now serves as the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Many of his decisions seemed to be \"hasty and ill-considered,\" Romig said. Some, like shuttering the agency or changing in-person identification guidelines, were ultimately reversed.\"I've never seen leadership like this before at SSA, by a long shot,\" she said.On a press call in March, Dudek said some contracts in Maine that let parents register their newborn children for an SSA number were \"canceled because I screwed up.\"\"I made the wrong move there. I should always ask my staff for guidance first before I cancel something,\" Dudek said. \"I'm new at this job. It looked fishy.\" The contracts were ultimately reinstated.Dudek and the Social Security Administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The Trump Administration is targeting the Social Security Administration for suspected fraud.VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty ImagesHis appointment pushed at least one SSA worker to leave. When they saw reports that he'd shared information with DOGE and was still elevated, \"it just all became a farce,\" the former worker said.A person who has spoken with Dudek said they believed some of his bluster might be a smoke screen. They said Dudek, like previous commissioners, said he feared that the system was on the brink of collapse and worried about people not receiving their benefits — a similar sentiment to what Dudek expressed in a recording obtained by ProPublica. They feel that he thinks he's doing damage control and running interference between DOGE and everyone else.\"It felt like a bunch of 6-year-olds with too much sugar had been put in charge of the agency and were just kind of running all over the place, randomly disconnecting and reconnecting things in different ways,\" the former SSA manager said.Bisignano's high-stakes challengeThis is what awaits Bisignano, who has developed a reputation as a hard-charging, demanding executive who tends to see Saturdays as just another workday.\"He was always making sure that everybody had their nose to the grindstone,\" Weill said.As he's moved from company to company, Bisignano has surrounded himself with a cadre of deputies, some of whom have been with him since his JPMorgan Chase days. Another person who knows Bisignano said some of these loyalists had shown they'd follow his lead without question, no matter how big the ask.\"They're going to pick up any call from Frank any time of day — morning, night, Saturday, Sunday, 7 a.m.,\" the person said.Some of the decisions at Fiserv that played out on Bisignano's watch appear to have ra",

Treasurers want to be part of the technology conversation. A recent report from PYMNTS Intelligence, in collaboration with Citi, reveals a disconnect between technology treasurers and their peers in other departments, leading to reduced influence in decision-making processes and potentially hampering financial performance in the sector. The report, “The Impact of Misunderstood Treasurers in Technology,” surveyed 500 treasurers and other department heads across various industries, including technology, and found that technology treasurers report lower levels of influence compared to their counterparts in sectors like consumer goods. This lack of integration with departments such as payments, partnerships, product and engineering results in treasurers being less involved in crucial interdepartmental decisions. Surprisingly, 62% of other department heads in technology believe current levels of collaboration are ideal, despite the fact that technology industry treasurers are 73% more likely to say more interdepartmental collaboration is needed. The consequences of this “influence gap” are significant for technology companies. The report highlights that the technology sector has the lowest shares of cash flow predictability and revenue optimism among the five sectors studied. Only 42% of technology treasurers report high cash flow predictability, the lowest across all industries. In contrast, 92% of treasurers believe that increasing their involvement with other departments, especially finance and business strategy, could improve cash flow predictability. Furthermore, 80% of technology treasurers believe the finance department would benefit from closer collaboration with them, and 62% feel the same about business strategy. This disconnect suggests that a potentially powerful lever for improving financial outcomes in the technology industry is not being fully used. Key data points from the report include: Only 50% of treasurers in the technology industry report having strong influence within their firms, compared to 73% in consumer packaged goods. 82% of technology industry treasurers note at least one barrier to interdepartmental collaboration, the highest share across all sectors studied. Just 42% of technology industry treasurers report high cash flow predictability for their firms, the lowest across all industries. Beyond the influence gap and its impact on cash flow predictability, the report also delves into the specific barriers hindering collaboration for technology treasurers. These include a lack of necessary information, physical separation due to remote work, and differing communication methods across departments. Notably, technology treasurers are 25% more likely than other colleagues to report being excluded from critical meetings. The report also indicates that a majority of technology treasurers believe greater interdepartmental involvement could lead to benefits beyond improved cash flow, such as faster cash conversion cycles, reduced debt, boosted profit margins, and greater returns on investment. The findings underscore the need for technology companies to address these collaborative shortcomings to unlock potential financial benefits and strengthen overall performance.

In a quarter overshadowed by tariff discussions and global economic jitters, three of the nation’s largest financial institutions — PNC, Citigroup, and Bank of America — presented first-quarter earnings Tuesday (April 15) that pointed to both lingering uncertainties and resilient consumer spending. Analysts and investors were keenly focused on whether consumers would begin to show signs of strain amid fluctuating economic signals, but the banks’ results demonstrated that, for now at least, the U.S. consumer remains on solid footing. A unifying thread across all three earnings calls was the emphasis on continuing demand from retail customers, underscored by robust credit- and debit-card activity. Bank of America’s supplemental results revealed that credit and debit spending was up 4%, with the number of transactions rising 2% to total $228 billion. At Citigroup, executives spotlighted comparable momentum in consumer businesses, with U.S. Personal Banking revenue reaching a record $5.2 billion. Meanwhile, PNC underscored its own ability to attract and retain clients, highlighting growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan commitments despite the uncertain climate. In short, executives from all three institutions painted a picture of a consumer who, while selective, remains a potent force in sustaining spending. Uncertainty, however, set the broader context for each discussion. Across multiple calls, tariff concerns and the possibility of a near-term recession cast a shadow over corporate and commercial lending decisions. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that while “organic growth remains strong,” businesses remain “sanguine on the current environment” but are re-evaluating capital expenditures amid shifting trade policy. At PNC, CEO William S. Demchak spoke candidly about volatility, remarking that these “fluid” conditions might ultimately raise the probability of recession if tariffs persist longer than anticipated. Similar caution was evident at Citigroup, which saw strong trading profits partly attributed to hedging and market activities tied to macroeconomic volatility. This environment of uncertainty appeared in loan portfolios as well. PNC Chief Financial Officer Robert Q. Reilly noted that the bank had not changed its guidance precisely because of the evolving situation, while at Bank of America, commercial lending was flat, a signal that corporate clients are deliberate about tapping credit lines in a setting rife with trade policy shifts. Citigroup, for its part, chose to fortify its credit reserves for card losses and set aside an additional allowance for credit losses tied to the “challenging macro environment.” Still, executives repeatedly stressed the relatively healthy state of the consumer. Moynihan pointed out that Bank of America’s internal data suggested that year-over-year consumer spending growth carried into April at a 5% rate. Much of this spending, he said, flows through multiple channels such as debit, credit, Zelle, and checks — indicating consumers are finding ways to keep money circulating in the economy. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser similarly noted that card portfolios showed “elevated” but still manageable levels of credit losses, aligned with an environment in which rising interest rates and inflation have begun to pinch certain segments of consumers. At PNC, Demchak said while everyday borrowers may well feel the brunt of uncertainty, sophisticated investors and well-capitalized commercial clients can seize opportunities when markets become unsettled. It wasn’t just spending that drew focus; the banks also highlighted the accelerating shift toward digital channels. Bank of America spotlighted a 65% digital sales mix in its most recent quarter — an increase from 53% a year earlier. Zelle payments reached $130 billion, up from $106 billion in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Moynihan touted new achievements for the bank’s virtual assistant Erica, now at 2.7 billion interactions since its 2018 launch. Citigroup showcased its own technological pivot, implementing artificial intelligence tools to modernize onboarding, detect unauthorized trades, and automate code reviews. These moves suggest that, despite caution around economic unknowns, banks continue to invest heavily in digital transformation to meet evolving customer expectations. Concluding the quarter’s discourse was a note of guarded optimism. PNC’s Demchak said the bank is “growing just fine,” with enough capital to support clients, even if a downturn arrives faster or heavier than anticipated. Bank of America’s CFO Alastair Borthwick emphasized that deposit growth has outstripped initial expectations, providing liquidity cushions. Citigroup, while acknowledging higher credit costs and ongoing structural changes, maintained full-year guidance on net interest income and expenses. Across all three calls, the overarching message was that while commercial clients may temporarily hold off on bigger investments, and credit costs could inch upward, the U.S. consumer’s resilience appears to support at least a measured outlook for the remainder of the year. In summary, Tuesday’s first-quarter earnings from Bank of America, PNC and Citigroup reinforced a collective narrative: Robust consumer spending is propping up results, even as companies and institutions grapple with an unclear macroeconomic landscape. Tariffs and the potential for a recession have not yet dramatically curbed consumer appetite, though some pullback in commercial lending and elevated caution on credit were evident. Digital adoption across retail banking and payments continues at a brisk pace, reflecting banks’ strategic push toward technology-driven growth. All three institutions remain watchful but confident that, if the climate grows stormier, they have the balance-sheet strength, client relationships, and technological capabilities to navigate what lies ahead.

Turmoil can be challenging for everyday consumers but offer the sophisticated investor opportunity. Citigroup on Tuesday (April 15) announced its first quarter 2025 financial results, spotlighting a 23% bump in trading profits amid ongoing macro uncertainty. At the same time, Citi’s credit costs increased 15% to $2.7 billion due to higher losses in card portfolios and an allowance for credit losses (ACL) build tied to macroeconomic uncertainty, Jane Fraser, CEO of Citi, struck a confident tone on Tuesday’s investor call. “We delivered a strong quarter, marked by continued momentum, positive operating leverage and improved returns,” Fraser said. But it wasn’t all balancing trading profits and consumer behavior. In response to the challenging macro environment, Citi is streamlining and rearchitecting its own global business. The transformation outlined to investors Tuesday was multifaceted: exiting 14 international consumer markets, simplifying its management structure and focusing on five interconnected businesses: Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking (USPB). Executives stressed to investors that despite market volatility, digital transformation and restructuring pressure, the bank’s first-quarter results showcase an organization executing decisively on a long-term vision, ultimately shedding legacy complexity while investing heavily in next-generation capabilities. “I’m not sure any bank ever finishes with modernization, because the pace of innovation is so fast,” Fraser said.

Though non-interest revenue dipped due to FX headwinds and episodic fees, net interest income grew 5%, powered by higher deposit spreads and volumes. Citi’s global network remained a differentiator: cross-border transaction values rose 5%, U.S. dollar clearing volume climbed 8% and TTS captured 65 basis points in market share. Credit costs were minimal at $51 million, and net income rose to $1.6 billion. Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) surged to 26.2%, reinforcing the segment’s role as a resilient and scalable profit driver. Citi’s Wealth segment, covering Citigold, Private Bank and Wealth at Work, posted its strongest quarter in recent memory. Revenue grew 24% to $2.1 billion, with net interest income up 30% and non-interest revenue up 16%. Client investment assets climbed 16% year-over-year, boosted by $16.5 billion in net new investment assets. A partnership with Palantir aims to modernize client onboarding and real-time insights, reflecting Citi’s larger digital push. While credit costs jumped to $98 million, net income still rose 62% to $284 million, delivering a 9.4% RoTCE. Citi’s transformation efforts continued with artificial intelligence (AI) being implemented across the bank’s workflows. Citi logged 385,000 utilizations of its document intelligence and virtual assistant tools and completed 220,000 automated code reviews using its GenAI developer toolkit. AI is also being used by the bank to detect unauthorized trading and streamline reconciliations, cutting risk while boosting efficiency — a tangible sign that Fraser’s technology-first philosophy is taking root.

Though Retail Services fell 11%, the business overall saw improved interest-earning balances and deposit spreads. Mortgage originations, however, declined 10% amid a tough housing market. Credit costs for the segment dropped 18% to $1.8 billion, largely due to a $172 million ACL release. Net income more than doubled to $745 million, with RoTCE jumping from 5.5% to 12.9%. New consumer products like Flex Pay on Apple Pay and AI-powered customer service tools underscored Citi’s intent to modernize retail banking. The “All Other” segment — which includes wind-down operations, including Mexico and legacy Asia markets — was a drag on performance. Revenues plunged 39% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, while expenses fell 17% to $2.2 billion. Credit costs increased 93% to $359 million, largely due to consumer losses in Mexico. The segment posted a net loss of $870 million, widening from $477 million a year ago. This remains a key area of weakness as Citi finalizes divestitures and works to offload remaining non-core operations. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Citi reaffirmed its full-year guidance, projecting net interest income of $83-84 billion and holding expenses just under $53.4 billion. “When all is said and done … the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency,” Fraser said.

        "description": "In every corner of the financial markets, from stocks to bonds to commodities, investors are sending President Donald Trump the same unmistakable message: The trade war he unleashed is threatening to set off a worldwide recession — and fast. Traders now are pricing in what increasingly looks like a negative-feedback loop as Trump indicates he’s not going to back down. The grim signs continued to pile up on Friday, when even a significantly stronger-than-expected US jobs report did virtually nothing to dispel growing worries about the state of the global economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell deepened those concerns, saying the shift in trade policy is likely to fan inflation and slow the pace of growth. Kate Moore, Chief Investment Officer for the Wealth Team at Citi Private Bank, explains why she's advising clients against buying into the market dip. Kate speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio. (Source: Bloomberg)",

        "description": "If the average tariff rate passes 20%, that could push the US into stagflation territory and give the economy a growth shock, Citi says. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BICiti is seeing a bigger risk of stagflation as Trump's new tariffs come into focus.The bank said large tariffs were pushing the US closer to stagflation territory.Top banks like Goldman Sachs and UBS have flagged the risk of stagflation to clients in recent weeks.Citi is the latest bank on Wall Street to sound the alarm for what would be a dire situation for the US economy. In a note to clients on Wednesday, the bank said it saw a higher risk of stagflation — a scenario that entails weak economic growth and stubbornly high inflation. Economists say such a scenario would be even harder than a recession for policymakers to solve, as high prices prevent the Fed from lowering interest rates to boost the economy.In this instance, the risks are rising largely because of Trump's latest tariff plan, strategists said. The president's new tariffs are set to kick in on Wednesday, which Trump has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" for the US.Trump's latest round of tariffs include a 25% tariff on imported cars and car parts.Win McNamee/Getty Images\"Looking out, large tariffs would move us closer to the stagflationary risks we have downplayed this past year,\" strategists said. \"This transition happens through a tightening of financial conditions which means fixed-income returns also turn negative — oil, gold and the USD are the assets that tend to deliver positive returns in this environment,\" the bank added.Citi defined large tariffs as those with a rate of 20% or more. That describes some of the new tariffs Trump has proposed, like a 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts, as well as tariffs already implemented on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.Citi's base case has the average tariff rate increasing to 10%. That's could push the US into stagflationary territory over a six-month timeline, Citi said. If the average tariff rate increases to 20%, that could make for an added \"growth shock,\" the bank predicted.Those projections are a major reversal for Citi, which originally discounted the risk of stagflation. In a February note, strategists said they believed inflation in the US had a \"stagflationary flavour,\" but was \"still a long way\" from genuine stagflation levels.Citi cut its rating on the US stock market in March, citing trade policy as one factor that could weigh on equity performance.Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty ImagesThe bank began to change its tone on the US macro environment in March. Strategists downgraded their rating on the US stock market last month, citing tariffs as one factor.Other forecasters have raised alarm for stagflation in recent weeks as Trump has honed in on his trade policy. Goldman Sachs, Stifel, BCA Research, UBS, Apollo, and Bank of America are among those on Wall Street who have flagged the risk of stagflation recently, with many citing uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policy as one factor.Classic signs of the worse-than-recession scenario have already started to bubble to the surface. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, accelerated 2.8% in February from last year, slightly above the 2.7% growth economists were expecting.Meanwhile, the economy looks like it's set to slow. GDP is expected to decline 3.7% over the first quarter, according to the latest projection from the Atlanta Fed, down from estimates the central bank posted the prior week.Read the original article on Business Insider",

As Citi’s venture capital arm, Citi Ventures scours a broad swath of startups from around the world to zero in on those that are generally aligned with the banking giant’s business strategy. From that vantage point, Citi Ventures has a good view of the artificial intelligence (AI) advances percolating from the cutting edge of Silicon Valley and beyond. In this exclusive interview, Jelena Zec, partner at Citi Ventures, shared the AI developments she is seeing not only from among the fund’s portfolio of 150 companies but also elsewhere. From regulatory compliance to ultra-personalized marketing offers, trends are starting to emerge. Zec said she looks at three factors when choosing startups to invest in: the founder, a sufficiently large total addressable market (TAM) and the business model, in that order. Citi Ventures invests in seed to Series C rounds, or early to late-stage businesses, with the average check ranging from $2 million to $15 million. Zec cites the following emerging trends in AI and FinTech: Speeding up compliance procedures A major trend emerging in financial services is the application of generative AI to regulatory compliance. Zec highlighted Norm AI, a company that trains specialized AI agents to assist SEC-regulated financial institutions. “Every time an SEC-regulated entity — it can be Citi, it can be a hedge fund, it can be a private equity fund — publishes [content] externally, it has to be SEC compliant,” she said. Norm AI streamlines the process by accelerating the review of marketing materials, flags content that is not compliant and recommends how to rephrase things to comply with current regulations. This technology moves beyond simple rule-based systems to AI that can understand context and nuance in regulatory language. The technology accelerates the review process while enhancing accuracy and addresses a labor-intensive process in financial operations. Content generation with a brand’s voice Another trend is AI-powered content generation specifically tailored to be faithful to a brand’s voice. Citi recently invested in Writer, which could be used by companies to communicate with clients with their own voice. Writer can help craft emails telling clients about the latest market trends while adhering to company guidelines, for example, Zec said. What distinguishes this trend from general AI content generation is its focus on compliance and brand consistency — critical concerns in highly regulated financial environments.

Zec pointed to startup Jump as an example of how generative AI is enhancing advisor efficiency by taking precise notes during meetings with clients. Jump uses generative AI to make wealth advisors more efficient. “It starts by capturing notes during meetings with clients and gathering all of what is unstructured data to enrich the CRM system,” she said. The technology allows advisors to focus entirely on client conversations while AI handles documentation, automatically uploads data to Salesforce or other CRM platforms and assists in drafting follow-up communications. Notably, Jump is “building agentic workflows that will also be able to execute tedious tasks on behalf of the wealth advisor,” Zec said. In the estate planning space, AI is solving the complex problem of digitizing non-standardized documents. Zec cited Wealth.com, which uses gen AI to extract information from old estate trust documents that are old, in poor shape perhaps with coffee stains, or handwritten so they’re hard to read. “They utilize gen AI to abstract information from old estate trust documents that are non-uniform and difficult to digitize,” Zec said. AI agent-to-agent payment systems For some reason, there has been less innovation with payment systems until recently, Zec said. But she is seeing some trends emerging in this area. One comes from a startup called Skyfire, which is building AI agents that can initiate payments using stablecoins as payment rails. “You create an AI agent and empower that agent with access, setting certain parameters like transaction limits,” she said. These agents operate within defined parameters but can autonomously execute financial transactions. The payment is made in stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a hard currency like the U.S. dollar, and the recipient converts it into hard currency. Zec said the use of stablecoins makes the transaction “super fast” and 24/7. One concept from Skyfire that excites Zec is “KYA,” for know your agent — a twist from the traditional know your customer (KYC) and know your business (KYB) protocols in financial services. Another company in this space, Payments, utilizes AI agents for executing mass payments. “They are utilizing AI agents … in big, massive payouts,” Zec said. An example is paying hundreds of gig workers all at once. Hyper-personalization After years of discussion about personalizing in commerce, artificial intelligence is finally enabling true hyper-personalization in financial services. “With gen AI, that piece can finally fulfill its promise,” Zec said. The convergence of vast customer data with real-time AI analysis capabilities is creating opportunities for personalization. As an example, Zec pointed to OfferFit, which employs reinforcement learning to conduct what amounts to individualized A/B testing at scale — something previously impossible with traditional technologies. “Think of it as A/B testing, but in real time, and you can do A/B testing on individuals, so every individual can get individual A/B testing at scale, thanks to technology,” she said.

Yaorusheng/Getty ImagesCiti strategists advise taking profits in US stocks and buying China shares.America's economic edge has dulled under Trump, impacting consumer sentiment and stock performance.China's tech advances and favorable valuations make the country's stocks attractive despite tariff risks.A pause in US exceptionalism suggests now is the time to take profits in US stocks and buy shares of companies in China, Citi strategists said in a Monday note.The bank downgraded US stocks to \"Neutral\" and upgraded China stocks to \"Overweight\" on an idea sweeping Wall Street in recent weeks: America's economic edge has dulled in opening days of the second Trump administration.Tariff policies and sweeping layoffs of federal employees have dinged consumer sentiment to such a degree that management teams at economic bellwethers like Delta Air Lines have warned of an imminent growth slowdown.\"This may be the last strong employment report, as DOGE cuts, voluntary resignations, and the weaker economy kick in,\" the strategists, led by Dirk Willer, said, referring to the February employment report published last Friday. Now, investors are pricing in rosier growth prospects for Europe and beyond, evidenced by their stock markets surging to record highs while the S&P 500 flounders.For Citi strategists, the near-10% decline in America's stock market is a good enough reason to start taking profits.\"After entering bubble territory, we are more vigilant on protecting profits,\" Willer said.The recent downside violation of the S&P 500's 200-day moving average and the inability of the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks to catch a bid were two bearish signals that were too big for Willer to ignore.\"When 4 out of 7 'generals' are fading, for at least 5 days, during bubbly periods, it is also a warning signal,\" Willer explained.Willer said the American AI trade should bounce back in the long term, but it will likely struggle for the next three to six months.\"In the bigger picture, we doubt that the AI bubble is already fully played out, and we would expect for the US to remain one of the leaders, maybe jointly with China, while the AI theme is intact,\" Willer said. \"But for the reasons mentioned above, we believe this is unlikely to be the right view for today, as we expect more negative US data prints.\"As to Willer's upgrade of China stocks, the strategist highlighted DeepSeek's technological breakthrough as proof that the country's technology \"is at the Western technological frontier (or beyond).\"The note highlighted that Alibaba and Tencent followed up with their own impressive AI models in recent weeks.The note said that combined with compelling valuations and President Xi's recent embrace of the tech sector, now is the time to buy China-based stocks, even with lingering tariff risks amid Trump's trade war.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Payroll payments provider Papaya Global reportedly added Citibank as a sponsor bank, joining the company’s other sponsor, JPMorgan Chase. The relationship with Citi will enable Papaya Global to expand to new geographic regions, Payments Dive reported Monday (March 10), citing its interview with Papaya Global CEO Eynat Guez. With the addition of Citi as a sponsor, Papaya Global will keep enhancing its cross-border payments capabilities that currently encompasses 160 countries and 130 currencies, and serves clients in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Asia, according to the report. “Multinational organizations simply cannot rely on error-prone manual inputs, capricious data security, changing FX rates, and erratic land dates when paying employees and contractors,” the company said in the report. Papaya Global did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company said Wednesday (March 5) that it formed a partnership with verification and compliance solutions provider Sumsub, in which Sumsub will offer Papaya artificial intelligence (AI)-powered fraud prevention and verification solutions. “When you enable global workforce payments, as we do at Papaya, thorough compliance and security is a top priority,” Amit Levi, senior vice president of product at Papaya Global, said at the time in a press release. “Anything less than that simply isn’t acceptable when serving enterprise clients. With Sumsub, we can take our compliance engine to the next level and deliver at scale, supporting our clients and their employees.” Papaya Global teamed up with cross-border payment platform dLocal in April to enable global firms to pay employees worldwide in local currencies in a timely fashion. The partnership launched in Latin America, including Chile, Colombia and Mexico; in Asia, including Indonesia and Vietnam; and in Africa, with plans to expand to additional territories. “The partnership with dLocal is exciting, because it speaks to the core of our mission at Papaya,” Ori Shilo, vice president of business development and partnerships at Papaya Global, said at the time in a press release. “Together, we are reshaping the global payments landscape, ensuring a premium payment experience without borders or compromises, and providing our customers with a strong base for scale and growth.” The post Report: Papaya Global Adds Citi as Sponsor Bank appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Investors' overreaction to seasonal volatility may represent a buying opportunity, Citi says. The post Trucking stocks tumble, but Citi sees opportunity in chaos appeared first on FreightWaves. Citi’s transportation analysts have released a report suggesting that the recent sell-off in trucking stocks may be overblown, driven by investors’ overreactions to sharp declines in trucking spot rates. The report highlights key factors and trends shaping the sector. Truckload spot rates have plummeted in early 2025, erasing gains from late 2024. While this drop partly reflects seasonal norms, its magnitude has exceeded investor expectations, fueled by excess capacity and soft demand in the trucking market. These findings align with insights from Craig Fuller and Zach Strickland on the latest State of Freight broadcast. They noted that spot rates have fallen more sharply than historical patterns suggest, attributing the decline to weather disruptions and policy uncertainty. Citi sees signs of market stabilization, with excess capacity shrinking—a recurring theme on State of Freight—though challenges persist. The report warns that weaker consumer spending and sluggish industrial output could delay a rate recovery. Despite progress from the “Great Freight Recession,” a broader economic slowdown might stall recent gains. Analysts flag risks to Q1 earnings amid tough macroeconomic conditions but note a silver lining: slower economic activity could accelerate capacity rationalization, potentially pushing marginal carriers out of the market faster. Tender rejections have increased the past week, suggesting truckload capacity is tight enough to respond to demand fluctuations. (Chart: SONAR. To learn more about SONAR, click here) In light of these dynamics, Citi downgraded Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX) to Neutral. KNX, a bellwether for early-cycle transport sentiment, has been volatile in 2025—rising 11% early in the year, then dropping 20% from its January 27 peak, including a 4% sell-off on a recent Friday. Analysts attribute this dip to market sentiment, not fundamentals. Despite near-term earnings risks from rate pressure, KNX’s share price has fallen below Citi’s $53 target, creating a balanced risk-reward profile—bolstered by management’s expertise in navigating transport cycles. The report also covers rail, advocating a two-pronged strategy with Canadian Pacific (CP) and CSX. CSX remains a top pick despite short-term headwinds, thanks to its lowest P/E ratio among rail operators and projected 2026 gains—appealing for long-term investors. Citi retains Buy ratings for CP and CSX, citing their resilience against macro risks like valuation concerns, tariff exposure, U.S. manufacturing weakness, and investment timelines. Ultimately, while trucking grapples with spot rate declines and economic uncertainty, Citi’s analysts see opportunities emerging from these conditions across both trucking and the broader transport sector.

Digital bank and FinTech company Green Dot said Monday (March 10) that it made a leadership transition and engaged Citi to explore strategic alternatives. Effective Friday (March 7), the company appointed its chairperson of the board, William I Jacobs, to also serve as interim CEO of Green Dot, and its chief revenue officer, Chris Ruppel, to also serve as interim president of Green Dot and interim CEO and president of Green Dot Bank, the company said in a Monday press release. They succeed George Gresham, who stopped serving as CEO and president of Green Dot and Green Dot Bank and as a member of the company’s board of directors, effective Friday, the release said. Jacobs has served as chairperson of the board since June 2016 and previously served as interim CEO from January 2020 through March 2020, per the release. Ruppel has served as chief revenue officer since November 2022. Of the strategic alternatives announced Monday along with the leadership transition, the press release said: “No assurances can be given as to the outcome or timing of the strategic review process, and Green Dot does not intend to make any further public comment regarding the process until it determines that disclosure is appropriate.” Green Dot said in a February earnings release that it saw a 3% decline in its full year adjusted EBITDA in 2024 and expected to see a 9% decline in its full year adjusted EBITDA in 2025. “We delivered fourth quarter results in line with our expectations and observed another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, while achieving an increase in active accounts for the first time in over three years,” Green Dot Chief Financial Officer Jess Unruh said in the Feb. 27 release. “Though our 2025 guidance indicates a decline in adjusted EBITDA, this is primarily due to continued headwinds in our Consumer Services segment. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about the potential for continued growth in our B2B and Money Movement segments, which are integral to our embedded finance strategy.” Also in February, Green Dot and Marqeta announced a partnership that enables Marqeta customers and their users to make cash deposits at Green Dot’s network of more than 95,000 locations across the U.S. The post Green Dot Changes Leadership and Explores Strategic Alternatives appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Buybacks have historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to generate stock gains during lean times. Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty ImagesStock buybacks could counteract extended market declines, according to Citi.The bank predicts $1 trillion in stock buybacks by 2025, up from 2024.Companies may shift spending from capital expenditures to buybacks amid Trump policy uncertainty.The stock market has a $1 trillion weapon to fight further price declines: stock buybacks.Analysts at Citi said in a Monday note that as the stock market continues to decline, it could present a too-good-to-ignore deal for companies to buy back their stocks at discounted levels.\"Should large cap US equities continue to correct, we expect that share repurchase activity would increase, thus providing some level of support to stock prices,\" Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi, said.Share repurchases have historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to generate stock gains during lean times, since reducing the number of units outstanding boosts the per-share price.Chronert estimates that in 2025, there could be $1 trillion in cumulative stock buybacks, representing an 11% increase from the about $900 billion spent on stock buybacks in 2024.Of note, according to Chronert, is that companies could begin to shift their spending away from capital expenditures and toward stock buybacks as the market moves lower, especially considering the uncertainty related to the Trump administration's tariffs and trade policies.\"While policy impacts may alter the trajectory from here, we continue to see enhanced financial flexibility for many companies with the S&P 500 as a counterbalance to current correction risk in the markets,\" Chronert said.The current breakdown of S&P 500 companies' cash use is as follows: about 30% goes to stock buybacks, about 25% to dividends, and about 45% to capital expenditures.Citi highlighted 5,500 on the S&P 500 as a compelling level of value for companies to ramp up their stock buybacks. That level represents a further 3% decline from current levels.With the bank expecting the index to rise to 6,500 by the end of the year, that's a potential upside of 18% from the 5,500 level if reached.The S&P 500 traded at 5,691 Monday morning.As to which S&P 500 companies are the largest buyers of their own stock, Citi highlighted Apple, Alphabet, Nvidia, Wells Fargo, and Visa on an absolute basis, which combined repurchased about $190 billion worth of shares last year.Read the original article on Business Insider",
