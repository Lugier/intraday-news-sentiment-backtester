        "description": "In the end, Intel Macs have mostly gotten a better deal than PowerPC Macs did. For the last three years, we've engaged in some in-depth data analysis and tea-leaf reading to answer two questions about Apple's support for older Macs that still use Intel chips. First, was Apple providing fewer updates and fewer years of software support to Macs based on Intel chips as it worked to transition the entire lineup to its internally developed Apple Silicon? And second, how long could Intel Mac owners reasonably expect to keep getting updates? The answer to the first question has always been \"it depends, but generally yes.\" And this year, we have a definitive answer to the second question: For the bare handful of Intel Macs it supports, macOS 26 Tahoe will be the final new version of the operating system to support any of Intel's chips.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Early engagement and integrated analytics will be critical for success in future semiconductor development. The post Tackling Advanced Chip Manufacturing Challenges appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. Intel and PDF Solutions are deepening their partnership to address the growing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing at advanced nodes, according to a recent discussion between Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and PDF Solutions CEO John Kibarian at the Direct Connect Intel Foundry event in April. During the presentation, Kibarian highlighted how the two companies have been collaborating for approximately four years to optimize chip design and manufacturing processes with a particular focus on yield improvement and accelerating time to market. “To maximize performance, profitability, and yields below seven nanometer, you really have to co-optimize,” Kibarian explained. “That co-optimization can’t begin after the fact. The R&D teams need to be working with the product portfolios in mind from the beginning.” The partnership comes at a crucial time as Intel pushes forward with its foundry services and advanced manufacturing nodes, including the 18A and 14A processes. According to the discussion, these technologies present significant design challenges that require early engagement between chipmakers, designers, and manufacturing partners. Kibarian noted that PDF Solutions along with Intel “initiated a way of working with design information brought into the manufacturing flow, enabled by e-beam inspection and created new ways of looking at characterization data.” One key innovation highlighted was Intel’s implementation of backside power delivery, a technological advancement that continues through its 14A node. This technology, along with advanced packaging solutions, requires designers to adapt their approaches and understand how to effectively leverage these capabilities. “When new architectures come out, it usually takes a little while just to make your code work well on it,” Kibarian noted. “The same thing is when you introduce things like backside power. The innovation that Intel has really brought forward with 18A and extending with 14A and advanced packaging as well, it’s a lot of capabilities that designers need to know how to take advantage of.” The collaboration focuses on leveraging data and machine learning to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. PDF Solutions’ systems help build Process Design Kits (PDKs) and datasets that enable R&D engineers to work more closely with design and production teams. “Electrical characterization data is the lingua franca in our industry,” Kibarian said, explaining how PDF’s analytics help connect different engineering teams that might otherwise use different technical languages and approaches. Both Tan and Kibarian emphasized the importance of handling increasing complexity in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly regarding power management, temperature control and testing procedures. They noted that AI-driven analytics are becoming essential to manage multiple test insertions and complex production flows. Kibarian added that “18A and 14A are designed with advanced packaging in mind and it is built into the PDK. It is not a stand-alone die. That means that you have to start thinking about your test flows with multiple test insertions. Most of the engineering teams we see are using AI to manage that complexity. That means more data feed forward and more data analytics, an area where PDF is contributing and where we are partnering with Intel.” The partnership also aims to create secure communication networks and data exchange systems that allow Intel to work more efficiently with both suppliers and customers. This collaborative approach is described as necessary for tackling the “unbelievably daunting” problems faced by semiconductor engineers. As chip designs continue to shrink in size and increase in complexity, the executives stressed that early engagement and integrated analytics will be critical for success in future semiconductor development. “Innovation drives benefit, but innovation needs the know-how to use the innovation,” Kibarian concluded, highlighting the need for continued investment in tools, characterization data, and engineering expertise to fully leverage advanced manufacturing technologies. Intel’s Tan expressed enthusiasm for deepening the collaboration with PDF Solutions as both companies work to address the semiconductor industry’s most significant challenges.

The support list for macOS Tahoe still includes Intel Macs, but it's been whittled down to just four models, all released in 2019 or 2020. We speculated that this meant that the end was near for Intel Macs, and now we can confirm just how near it is: macOS Tahoe will be the last new macOS release to support any Intel Macs. All new releases starting with macOS 27 will require an Apple Silicon Mac. Apple will provide additional security updates for Tahoe until fall 2028, two years after it is replaced with macOS 27. That's a typical schedule for older macOS versions, which all get one year of major point updates that include security fixes and new features, followed by two years of security-only updates to keep them patched but no longer receive new features. Apple is also planning changes to Rosetta 2, the Intel-to-Arm app translation technology created to ease the transition between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. Rosetta will continue to work as a general-purpose app translation tool in both macOS 26 and macOS 27.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. Cloud computing rose rapidly around 2010, powered by AMD’s Opteron and Intel’s Xeon processors. The large cloud market piqued the interest of other CPU makers including Qualcomm. Qualcomm had grown to become a formidable force in the mobile SoC market by the mid-2010s, and had several in-house CPU designs under their belt. They had good reason to be confident about their cloud server prospects. High core counts in server chips translate to low per-core power, blunting AMD and Intel’s greatest strength of high single threaded performance.From a 2017 Qualcomm presentationMeanwhile, Qualcomm’s mobile background gave them plenty of experience in low power CPU design. Their high mobile volume gave them access to Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. That could at least level the playing field against Intel’s 14nm node, if not give Qualcomm an outright advantage in power consumption and density. Qualcomm hoped to use those factors to deliver a cheaper, lower power competitor on the cloud computing scene.To break into the cloud computing segment, Qualcomm needed a CPU architecture with enough performance to meet key metrics in areas like tail-end latency. During a Hot Chips presentation, Qualcomm noted that throwing a pile of weak cores onto a chip and calling it day wouldn’t cut it. An Arm cloud CPU may not have to match Intel and AMD core for core, but they do need to hit a baseline level of performance. Qualcomm hopes to do that while maintaining their traditional power and density advantages.Core OverviewThe Falkor CPU architecture aims to meet that performance threshold with low power and silicon area requirements. Falkor is a 4-wide aarch64 core with features inherited from Qualcomm’s prior mobile cores. It runs the 64-bit Arm instruction set (aarch64, armv8) with a few features pulled in from armv8.1. 32-bit Arm support is absent, as there’s no large existing install base of Arm server applications. Falkor is Qualcomm’s 5th in-house core design, and the company’s first designed specifically for cloud computing.A Centriq 2400 series chip packs up to 48 Falkor cores on a 398mm2 die with a 120W TDP. That translates to less than 2.5W per core. Qualcomm notes that power consumption is usually well under 120W in typical all-core loads.Qualcomm slide showing Centriq server SKUsFor this article, Neggles (Andi) was given a Centriq 2452 system from the folks at Corellium at no cost in order for us to test it. So a massive shout out to both Corellium for providing the system as well as to Neggles for getting the system up and running. The Centriq 2452 system is set up with 96 GB of DDR4 running at 2666 MT/s, and identifies itself as the “Qualcomm Centriq 2400 Reference Evaluation Platform CV90-LA115-P23”.FrontendFalkor has both a L0 and L1 instruction cache like Qualcomm’s prior Krait architecture, and possibly Kryo too. The 24 KB, 3-way set associative L0 delivers instructions at lower power and with lower latency. The L0 is sized to contain the large majority of instruction fetches, while the 64 KB 8-way L1 instruction cache handles larger code footprints. Although the L0 fills a similar role to micro-op caches and loop buffers in other CPUs, it holds ISA instruction bytes just like a conventional instruction cache.Both instruction cache levels have enough bandwidth to feed Falkor’s 4-wide decoder. The two instruction cache levels are exclusive of each other, so the core effectively has 88 KB of instruction cache capacity. Qualcomm might use a victim cache setup to maintain that exclusive relationship. If so, incoming probes would have to check both the L0 and L1, and L1 accesses would incur the additional cost of a copy-back from L0 on top of a fill into L0. An inclusive setup would let the L1 act as a snoop filter for the L0 and reduces the cost of L1 accesses, but has less total caching capacity.The exclusive L0/L1 setup gives Falkor high instruction caching capacity compared to contemporary cores. Falkor wouldn't be beaten in this respect until Apple's M1 launched several years later. High instruction cache capacity makes L2 code fetch bandwidth less important. Like many 64-bit Arm cores of the time, or indeed AMD's pre-Zen cores, Falkor's instruction throughput drops sharply once code spills into L2. Still, Faklor performs better than A72 in that respect.Falkor's instruction caches are parity protected, as is common for many CPUs. Hardware resolves parity errors by invalidating corrupted lines and reloading them from L2. The instruction caches also hold branch targets alongside instruction bytes, and therefore serve as branch target buffers (BTBs). A single cache access provides both instructions and branch targets, so Falkor doesn't have to make a separate BTB access like cores with a decoupled BTB do. However, that prevents the branch predictor from following the instruction stream past a L1i miss.Taken branches incur one pipeline bubble (2 cycle latency) within L0, and up to 6 cycle latency from L1. For smaller branch footprints, Falkor do zero-bubble taken branches using a 16 entry branch target instruction cache (BTIC). Unlike a BTB, the BTIC caches instructions at the branch destination rather than the target address. It therefore bypasses cache latency, and allows zero-bubble taken branches without needing to make a L0 achieve single cycle latency.Direction prediction uses multiple history tables, each using a different history length. The branch predictor tracks which history length and corresponding table works best for a given branch. The scheme described by Qualcomm is conceptually similar to a TAGE predictor, which also uses multiple history tables and tags tables to indicate whether they’re useful for a given branch. Falkor doesn’t necessarily use a classic TAGE predictor. For example, the history lengths may not be in a geometric series. But the idea of economizing history storage by using the most appropriate history length for each branch still stands. Arm’s Cortex A72 uses a 2-level predictor, presumably with a single table and a fixed history length.In an abstract test with varying numbers of branches, each being taken or not-taken in random patterns of increasing length, Falkor does slightly better than Kryo. Falkor handles better with a lot of branches in play, though the longest repeating pattern either core can handle is similar for a small number of branches.Falkor a two-level indirect target array for indirect branches, which read a target from a register rather than specifying a jump distance. An indirect branch may go to different targets, adding another dimension of difficulty to branch prediction. Falkor’s first level indirect target array has 16 entries, while a second level has 512 entries.Having multiple targets for an indirect branch carries little penalty as long as total target count doesn’t exceed 16. That can be one branch switching between 16 targets, or eight branches alternating between two targets each.Returns are a special case of indirect branches, because they typically go back to the call site. Falkor has a 16 entry return stack like Kryo. Cortex A72 has a much larger return stack with 31 entries. A function call and return costs approximately four cycles on Falkor, Kryo, and A72, which would be an average of 2 cycles per branch-with-link instruction.Falkor’s decoders translate up to four instructions per cycle into micro-ops. Like most other CPUs, Qualcomm aims to decode most common instructions into a single micro-op. 128-bit vector math instructions appear to be a notable exception.Rename/AllocateMicro-ops from the decoders need resources allocated in the backend for bookkeeping during out-of-order execution. Falkor’s renamer can handle register renaming and resource allocation for up to for micro-ops per cycle. However, the fourth slot can only process direct branches and a few specialized cases like NOPs or recognized register zeroing cases. A conditional branch that also includes an ALU operation, like cbz/cbnz, cannot go into the fourth slot.Slide from Qualcomm’s Hot Chips presentationBesides special handling for zeroing registers by moving an immediate value of zero into it, I didn’t see other common optimizations carried out.There’s no MOV elimination, and the renamer doesn’t recognize that XOR-ing or subtracting a register from itself results in zero.Out-of-Order ExecutionFalkor doesn’t have a classic reorder buffer, or ROB. Rather, it uses a series of structures that together enable out-of-order execution while ensuring program results are consistent with in-order execution. Falkor has a 256 entry rename/completion buffer. Qualcomm further states Falkor can have 128 uncommitted instructions in flight, along with another 70+ uncommitted instructions for a total of 190 in-flight instructions. The core can retire 4 instructions per cycle.From a microbenchmarking perspective, Falkor acts like Arm’s Cortex A73. It can free resources like registers and load/store queue entries past a long latency load, with no visible limit to reordering capacity even past 256 instructions. An unresolved branch similarly blocks out-of-order resource deallocation, after which Falkor’s reordering window can be measured. At that point, I may be measuring what Qualcomm considers uncommitted instructions.Kryo and Falkor have similar reordering capacity from that uncommitted instruction perspective. But otherwise Qualcomm has re-balanced the execution engine to favor consistent performance for non-vector code. Falkor has a few more register file entries than Kryo, and more crucially, far larger memory ordering queues.Integer execution pipelines on Falkor are specialized to handle different categories of operations from each other. Three pipes have integer ALUs, and a fourth pipe is dedicated to direct branches. Indirect branches use one o",

U.K. chip designer Arm is making an aggressive move into the personal computer (PC) market long dominated by Intel, as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered personal computing reshapes the industry and opens new opportunities for the company. “We think that 40% of PCs and tablets will be based on the Arm architecture that ship this year,” said Chris Bergey, senior vice president and general manager of Arm’s client line of business, in an interview with PYMNTS. “That’s actually a growing number.” Bergey said that while Arm already dominates the smartphone market — its architecture powers about 99% of smartphones — it is now gaining traction in areas where Intel historically has dominated, including Windows laptops and Chromebooks. “In Chromebooks, we’re only about maybe 25% share,” Bergey said. “The rest of that is largely Intel,” but it’s an expanding area for Arm. Since AI is a notorious power hog, Arm wants to leverage what it is known for — power-efficient designs — to position it well in the generative AI era. “We’ve always been focused on power performance,” Bergey said. “That’s really been a big part of our success.” Bergey is particularly bullish about Arm’s prospects in edge computing, where AI workloads are processed in the mobile device without going to the cloud. “The real thing that we see coming is AI inference on the edge,” Bergey said, adding that it’s done at the edge for reasons including privacy, power, connectivity, latency and responsiveness. That edge computing capability is increasingly critical in PCs, especially as companies look to reduce cloud infrastructure costs and enable AI-powered features on the device itself. For example, an app developer doing AI in the cloud would have to pay per token. But if the work is pushed down to the devices, “I’m not going to get that bill, so I might have very different economics,” Bergey said. Arm’s PC push comes as Intel is restructuring its operations after falling behind rivals such as Nvidia and AMD. AI’s intensive workloads are ideal for GPUs, the ones that Nvidia spent over a decade developing, which gave it a head start. Intel is best known for its CPUs and it is investing in AI chips but still trails Nvidia. Read more: Intel’s New CEO Vows to Reform Outdated Development Model Broader Industry Shift Bergey said accelerating the shift to edge computing is Microsoft’s integration of AI tools like Copilot and Recall into Windows. Arm sees this as a chance to challenge incumbents of x86 — the architecture that has dominated PCs for decades and is largely associated with Intel — on performance, battery life and AI readiness. “Some of the later projections are that 70% of PCs will basically have acceleration or be AI Copilot PCs,” Bergey said. Arm is making sure it’s ready for that demand. It has rolled out AI libraries called Kleidi that help developers integrate Arm features into AI frameworks. Arm is also gaining ground through partnerships with PC makers and chip designers. MediaTek, for example, recently introduced a high-performance Chromebook chip with both CPU and GPU components designed with Arm. Though Intel still dominates the traditional PC market, Arm’s share gains signal a broader industry transition. Apple’s full migration to Arm-based silicon for its Mac lineup was a major validation — and it’s a company with which Arm has a deep connection. “Apple, you remember, was the original investor involved over 30 years ago,” Bergey said. “They’ve been an amazing partner for us.” Arm’s history also includes another tech giant: Nvidia. In 2020, Nvidia offered to acquire Arm for $40 billion from SoftBank to create a chip powerhouse. But British regulators did not approve the deal due to antitrust concerns, and the transaction was terminated two years later. In September 2023, Arm went public, with SoftBank retaining a 90% stake. Bergey said that as companies look to buy their next round of PCs, they will look for ones that are AI-enabled. “Especially the way that enterprise IT thinks about three- to five-year life cycles, you would want to make sure that you’re buying the PCs that have the AI acceleration because it’s going to be a very important workload for the future,” Bergey added.

        "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty images; Tyler Le/BIMicrosoft is among the latest to cut middle management jobs.Tech giants like Intel, Amazon, and Google are also flattening structures for efficiency.Experts warn that while flattening can speed decisions, it is possible to take it too far.Companies are shedding bloated layers of management in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy. Some employees are applauding the move, known as flattening the middle, in the hopes of getting faster and boosting efficiency.Microsoft said Tuesday it's slashing around 6,000 employees. While the days since have made it clear many of those cut were individual contributor-level engineers, executives previously told BI one motivation behind the recent cuts was to increase managers' \"span of control,\" or the number of reports per manager.Intel announced a great flattening last month, emphasizing more time in the office, less admin, and leaner teams.\"The best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,\" said the chip giant's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a memo to staff.Amazon has also increased the ratio of individual contributors to managers. They call it a \"builder ratio.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff late last year that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push. Meta has been at it for years, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing in a 2023 memo, \"flatter is faster.\"The risk is that these companies cut too many managers, leaving the remaining folks with too many direct reports.But for now, it appears to be a risk companies are willing to take.Agility and expertiseThe logic of cutting from the middle to speed up is sound, management experts say.\"You can't go faster and be more connected to a larger ecosystem if you're having to go up and down a hierarchy for every decision,\" Deborah Ancona, a professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Business Insider.While some companies have been trying for decades to zap management layers, there's a new urgency to do so. Businesses exist in \"an exponentially changing world,\" Ancona said.Dell executives explained this to employees earlier this month, when they began reorganizing managers to have more direct reports. The company, whose head count has dropped by 25,000 in two years, also pointed to the influx of artificial intelligence as a reason it needed to move faster.Ideally, companies would remove layers and spread decision-making throughout the organization so that those closest to customers or technology, for example, could generate ideas and make decisions, Ancona said.\"You're kind of flipping the organization,\" she said. \"Rather than all the ideas coming from on high, you have entrepreneurial leaders who are lower down in the organization coming up with new ideas.\"Bayer CEO Bill Anderson is leery of having to run everything up the chain. After taking over the German biotech company in 2023, he began implementing what he calls a \"dynamic shared ownership\" setup that has cut thousands of managers. Staffers come together in \"mini networks\" for 90-day stretches to work on projects.\"We hire highly educated, trained people, and then we put them in these environments with rules and procedures and eight layers of hierarchy,\" Anderson previously told BI. \"Then we wonder why big companies are so lame most of the time.\"Fewer managers, more reporting, more meetings?When middle managers are cut and layers condensed, inevitably, more workers report to fewer managers. The logistics of that vary, and the success in terms of morale has a lot to do with the starting point.Amazon started flattening last year. In September, CEO Andy Jassy ordered a 15% increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers by March. BI reported that senior Amazon Web Services managers received a memo in January instructing them to restrict high-level hiring and increase their number of direct reports.An Amazon spokesperson told BI at the time that the memo may have been intended for one team, but does not apply to the company at large. The Amazon spokesperson also referenced a September memo from Jassy on the importance of reducing management layers.An AWS manager told BI this month that the flatter structure has since put more burden on employees on her team to report on what they're doing day-to-day, in addition to their actual work, since managers have less time to inspect individuals' work.Plus, this manager said they are spending more time in meetings as they took on a more diverse group of direct reports. The Amazon spokesperson also emphasized that the individual employee's anecdote does not represent the company as a whole.Yvonne Lee-Hawkins was assigned 21 direct reports when she worked for Amazon's human resources. She told BI that she had to quickly learn new skills to handle the load, like asynchronous work strategies, but her teams' performance suffered as her number of reports grew from 11 to 21 employees.Weekly one-on-ones — the subject of much debate among tech titans — became impossible, and she had to cut them in half.At Microsoft, a half-dozen employees who spoke to BI about the manager flattening trend generally regarded it as a positive step to eliminate inefficient and unnecessary levels of managers. Some managers have as few as one or two reports.Microsoft ended up with many management layers, the people said, because it often tried to reward good engineers by promoting them to become managers. Often, those engineers-turned-managers still spent most of their time in the codebase and weren't very effective as managers.Meanwhile, larger groups of direct reports often work better for senior employees, who need less one-on-one time and can do more things in a group setting.A Microsoft spokesperson did not comment when asked about these factors.Gary Hamel, a visiting professor at London Business School who lives in Silicon Valley, told BI that pushing managers to take on more direct reports can reduce micromanaging, a common bane of corporate existence.When managers have a lot of people to oversee, it pushes them to hire people they trust, mentor rather than manage, and give up a \"pretty big dose\" of their authority.\"Those are all hugely positive things,\" he said, even if they require \"a fairly dramatic change\" in how managers see their role.How many direct reports is too many?Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang famously has 60 direct reports. Managers at Dell have been told they should have 15 to 20. An AWS document viewed by BI in January mandated no fewer than eight per manager, up from six. An Amazon spokesperson told BI there are no such requirements companywide.Gallup research indicates that the quality of a manager matters more than the number of direct reports in terms of how well teams perform. That's because more engaged managers tend to lead to more engaged teams. And small teams — those with fewer than 10 people — show both the highest and lowest levels of engagement because managers can have an outsize effect, for better or worse.That may explain why some companies seem to thrive with dozens of direct reports per manager and others fail.The nature of the work matters, too. When work is more complex, it can be harder for managers to oversee too many people.Managing dozens of people gets harder when \"life intersects with work,\" Ravin Jesuthasan, the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI.When employees have an issue, they often need someone to talk to about it.\"As a manager, you are the first port of call,\" he said.That's one reason, Jesuthasan said, that having something like 20 direct reports would likely be \"really hard.\" For most managers, the couple of dozen direct reports that many tech companies are aiming for is probably the limit, he said.Strong managers can powerfully boost a company's ability to develop talent and its bottom line. A 2023 analysis from McKinsey & Company, for example, found that organizations with \"top-performing\" managers led to significantly better total shareholder returns over five years compared with those entities that had only average or subpar managers.While flattening schemes may be successful at reducing bulk in the middle and speeding up decision-making, they can hinder future growth if they're not well-managed.Jane Edison Stevenson, global vice chair for board and CEO services at the organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry, told BI that removing layers from a management pyramid can help elevate those high performers. But flatter companies may fail to develop leaders who can pull together the disparate parts of an organization.At some point, she said, \"You've got to start to make a bet on the leaders that are going to have a chance to build muscle across, not just vertically.\"Read the original article on Business Insider Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty images; Tyler Le/BIMicrosoft is among the latest to cut middle management jobs.Tech giants like Intel, Amazon, and Google are also flattening structures for efficiency.Experts warn that while flattening can speed decisions, it is possible to take it too far.Companies are shedding bloated layers of management in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy.

        "description": "Surface Laptop Studio 2 is reportedly no longer being manufactured. Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay left the company for Amazon in late 2023, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New smaller versions of both of these mainstays were introduced just a couple of weeks ago. But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge reports that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold. Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with its six-year support lifecycle for Surface hardware.Read full article Comments",

A new technical paper titled “STAMP-2.5D: Structural and Thermal Aware Methodology for Placement in 2.5D Integration” was published by researchers at Pennsylvania State University, Intel, Arizona State University and University of Notre Dame. Abstract “Chiplet-based architectures and advanced packaging has emerged as transformative approaches in semiconductor design. While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory study on the effects of temperature gradients on structural integrity, providing crucial insights for reliability-conscious chiplet design. STAMP-2.5D establishes a robust platform for navigating critical trade-offs in advanced semiconductor packaging.” Find the technical paper here. April 2025.

        "description": "Linus Torvalds sees \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on them. Intel's i486 was the first \"computer number\" I ever really understood. Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16–100 MHz) and \"DX\" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it. More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years after Intel stopped making them, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar, quoting Linus Torvalds regarding \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (Time Stamp Counter) and CX8 (i.e., \"fixed\" CMPXCH8B, its own whole thing), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors). It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. \"We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022,\" Torvalds wrote in October 2022. Failing major changes to the 6.15 kernel, which will likely arrive late this month, i486 support will be dropped.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are developing a broad set of technologies and relationships that will be required for the next generation of AI chips. The post Three-Way Race To 3D-ICs appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. Intel Foundry, TSMC, and Samsung Foundry are scrambling to deliver all the foundational components of full 3D-ICs, which collectively will deliver orders of magnitude improvements in performance with minimal power sometime within the next few years. Much attention has been focused on process node advances, but a successful 3D-IC implementation is much more complex and comprehensive than just scaling digital logic. It requires new materials, and different ways of handling thinner substrates and putting them together. It involves different backside power delivery schemes, various types of bridges, interface standards for multi-die communication, and new interconnect technologies and approaches. And it will require substantial changes in EDA tools and methodologies, digital twins, multi-physics simulation, as well as reorganizations of engineering teams and flows, and the infusion of AI at multiple stages of the design-through-manufacturing flows. 3D-ICs have been on the foundries’ internal roadmaps for more than a decade, but it wasn’t until the rollout of ChatGPT two years ago and the subsequent build-out of AI data centers that full die-on-die stacking really gained momentum. Since then, the focus has been on big improvements in both power and performance, and the best way to get there is by disaggregating SoCs, parallelizing massive numbers of compute elements, and reducing the distance, resistance, and capacitance that signals encounter as they are shuttled back and forth between different processing elements and memories. Vertical benefits The goals here are well understood, but some of the technologies needed to get there are still under development. This explains why all of the foundries have announced plans to spend somewhere around $100 billion each in coming years to bring 3D-ICs into volume manufacturing. There are lots of problems to solve, and most of them need to be solved up front and proven in silicon in order to make this work. Just relying on the power, performance, and area/cost benefits of planar scaling is no longer sufficient from a technological or economic standpoint. “The transistor technology and advanced packaging integration have to go hand-in-hand in order to provide our customers with a complete product-level solution,” said Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of business development and global sales at TSMC. “A 3D fabric technology portfolio has become really important for us.” It’s well documented that signals travel faster in a planar system-on-chip than between different dies in some type of system-in-package. But while digital transistors still scale, SRAM and wires do not. And at the most advanced nodes, packing everything together onto single reticle-sized die frequently results in low yield and a significant drop in first-time silicon success. In response, systems companies and leading-edge processor vendors have begun decomposing SoCs and turning them into assemblies of chiplets in advanced packages. Yield is higher for a small, narrowly focused chiplet than a large SoC, and the design costs per chiplet are lower. And in theory, there is no limit to how many can be assembled into a customized package to improve performance. However, the performance of those multi-die assemblies falls off sharply when data needs to be moved back and forth between memories and processing elements. This is the proverbial memory wall, and it’s a function of distance and the speed at which signals travel over wires. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) works well enough for L3 cache. It’s much faster than standard DRAM due to its wider channels (2,048 lanes with HBM4), which helps reduce resistance and capacitance. But SRAM is still faster, making it the memory of choice for L1 and L2 cache. SRAM typically is configured with six transistors, which dramatically improves access versus DRAM, which uses one transistor and one capacitor. That capacitor is needed to address charge leakage, which sometimes happens spontaneously when DRAM heats up. Hybrid approaches help, as does stacking more layers of HBM. Samsung, SK hynix and Micron are the only companies manufacturing HBM. Samsung has used that as a springboard to begin customizing HBM for specific workloads. But the optimal solution is more of both HBM and SRAM, and the latest roadmaps from the foundries show a complex mix of different memories with very tight interconnect pitches to facilitate data movement. Intel’s most recent architectures shows layers of 14A logic stacked directly above a layer of SRAM tiles. Fig. 1: Intel’s 3D-IC concept with 14A chiplets packaged on top of SRAM with EMIB bridge technology connecting it to I/Os and surrounded by HBM for L3 caching. Source: Intel “Everybody talks about the memory wall,” said Kevin O’Buckley, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Foundry. “As we’re scaling more and more cores, and driving compute performance higher and higher, keeping the beast fed is the priority. 3D is an example of the way we can use a substantial portion of the die area for SRAM without sacrificing all that area for the compute that’s still required.” This approach requires a completely different way of putting chips together, though. So does logic-on-logic, which has been on the drawing board for years, but which was largely sidelined due to thermal issues. The goal here is to be able to double the transistor density by adding another level of processing elements and memories and have them behave as a single system. “We start with face-to-back integration to bring two dies together,” said TSMC’s Zhang. “We also are developing face-to-face, allowing a customer to maximize the interconnect density between the two dies. If you look at the hyper-bonding pitch when we stack the die together, it will continue to shrink from 9 microns to 6 microns, and all the way down to 5 microns and below. The integration will have face-to-back and face-to-face to address different applications.” Fig. 2: TSMC’s 3D-IC roadmap showing different integration strategies. Source: TSMC In a presentation last spring, Taejoong Song, Samsung Foundry’s vice president of foundry business development, showed a roadmap featuring logic-on-logic mounted on a substrate, combining a 2nm (SF2) die on top of a 4nm (SF4X) die, both mounted on top of another substrate. This is basically a 3D-IC on a 2.5D package, sometimes called 3.5D. Song said the foundry will begin stacking an SF1.4 on top of SF2P, starting in 2027. Fig. 3: Samsung’s roadmap for 3D-ICs. Source: Samsung Vertical limits Regardless of the layout, thermal dissipation remains the biggest challenge, and it is the most- cited reason why progress on 3D-ICs was so slow. Much has changed since then, and the performance and power demands of chipmakers at the leading edge require a concerted effort to address this issue. While exact delivery dates for this technology remain fuzzy, all three foundries now display 3D-ICs prominently on their roadmaps. At least part of the solution may be a combination of logic developed at the latest node and N-1or N-2. But the goal is much tighter integration so it behaves as one system, connected through high-speed interfaces to other key components that have been stripped out of the planar SoC. Multiple solutions for removing trapped heat have emerged over the past few years, not all of which are ready for mass production. Among them: Thermal vias. Through-silicon vias can be used to channel heat directly from processing elements to heat sinks on the outside of a package. The challenge here is figuring how many and where to locate these mini-chimneys, because different workloads can produce unique thermal gradients. Vapor caps. This approach works like an evaporative (aka swamp) cooler. As a gas passes over a wet pad, it absorbs liquid, then evaporates, removing some of the heat to an external heat sink. Initial experiments using this approach failed because the target devices were mobile phones, which are constantly being moved and shaken. But in a data center, server racks are immobile when in use, making this approach more viable and relatively inexpensive. Microfluidics. This idea dates back to the 1980s, when mainframes required water cooling. (That is now optional again for some systems, though not necessarily with water). This made upgrades difficult, and like all plumbing, sometimes it leaked. When air-cooled minicomputers and racks filled with PC server blades were installed, many customers saw it as a huge benefit. But with higher transistor density and heavy workloads, moving liquid through tiny channels is once again being actively researched. Thermal interface materials. These materials, which come in the form of pads, pastes, and solid materials — and more recently carbon nanotubes — are effective at conducting heat, but they’re also expensive and relatively untested over time. The industry is still working on determining which are the best materials to use, and in what combinations, at which point economies of scale may kick in. Immersion. While it sounds counterintuitive, electronics can be immersed in inert liquids without causing shorts. The challenge here is reusability, sustainability, and cost. Designing for data Increasing the number of transistors in a multi-die assembly also increases the wiring congestion. Advanced place-and-route tools have been able to automate much of that, but they don’t address the problem of getting power to all the transistors, which is essential to maintaining performance. This is why all three of the big foundries either have developed, or are developing, backside power delivery (BPD): Intel’s PowerVia BPD will accompany RibbonFET nanosh",

        "description": "Laptops with Core Ultra 200V chips CPUs Arc 130V or 140V GPUs should benefit. Intel's oddball Core Ultra 200V laptop chips—codenamed Lunar Lake—will apparently be a one-off experiment, not to be replicated in future Intel laptop chips. They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V. Today, Intel announced some updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent, and can speed up \"1 percent low FPS\" (that is, for any given frames per second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level. Intel's performance numbers for its new GPU drivers on a laptop running at the \"common default power level\" of 17 W. Credit: Intel Intel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8). The two additional driver packages Intel has released since then will contain the improvements, too.Read full article Comments",

A new technical paper titled “Controlled Shared Memory (COSM) Isolation: Design and Testbed Evaluation” was published by researchers at Arizona State University and Intel Corporation. Abstract “Recent memory sharing approaches, e.g., based on the Compute Express Link (CXL) standard, allow the flexible high-speed sharing of data (i.e., data communication) among multiple hosts. In information systems for sensitive data, the data sharing between hosts, must be closely controlled. Security policies may require strict isolation, so-called air-gapping. However, strict isolation mechanisms are currently lacking in data communications based on shared memory. We propose the novel COntrolled Shared Memory (COSM) framework for strictly and dynamically controlling the data communication via shared memory approaches. We introduce the novel concept of COSM isolation, which restricts data communication via shared memory regions with first-level isolation based on a write-and-read permission matrix and second-level isolation based on data inspection. These isolation levels are enforced by the memory controller on an externally-attached shared memory device (ESMD). COSM isolation is thus generally more secure than the existing software based isolation (e.g., virtual machine isolation of a hypervisor) and existing hardware-assisted isolation (e.g., single-root input/output virtualization). We implement COSM host-to-host isolation in a testbed with an ESMD built on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We evaluate the host data write and read rates [bit/s] and latencies under various ESMD loads as well as write-and-read permission configurations. The introduced COSM isolation can serve as the foundation for a new sub-field of research within the information technology (IT) security research field.” Find the technical paper here. April 2025.

        "description": "Shares of the chipmaker fell dropped even as earnings beat estimates, with the firm posting a weak second-quarter outlook amid tariff fears. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesIntel's stock fell as much as 10% on Friday on a weak outlook that factored in the impact of tariffs.The company expects tariffs to add costs amid growing odds of a recession.Its estimate-beating results were boosted by consumers looking to get ahead of the trade war, it said.The move: Intel shares fell as much as 10% Friday, hitting an intraday low of $19.34 per share. The slump shortly after the open erases the stock's year-to-date gain.Why: Investors dumped shares on Friday despite better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.While the firm notched adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.13, beating consensus expectations, it failed to break a streak of quarterly losses, logging an $821 million income decline.Guidance was more discouraging. For the second quarter, Intel expects $11.2 billion to $12.4 billion in revenue, short of projections of $12.8 billion.\"The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing,\" David Zinsner, Intel's chief financial officer, said in the earnings call.What it means: In other words, Intel is sharing in the macroeconomic jitters that many companies have expressed in the early days of Trump's trade war. \"While we have offsets including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction,\" he added.The firm's first-quarter outperformance could be justified by a consumer rush to buy Intel's products ahead of tariff disruptions, he added.All in all, this uncertainty is a bleak outlook for a company already in a bind. On Thursday, the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, issued a memo to redirect the company back from the brink: plans include layoffs and a stricter return-to-office mandate.Over recent years, the semiconductor designer has fallen behind on the artificial intelligence race, and has had to navigate an era of layoffs and buyouts.Read the original article on Business Insider",

        "description": "Yesterday was an eventful day for shareholders and employees of Intel Corp. The American chipmaker reported its Q1 2025 results while its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, confirmed earlier reports that Intel would be laying off employees. Here’s what you need to know about those layoffs and the latest movement in Intel’s stock price. New Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan confirms job cuts The most devastating news to come out of Intel yesterday was that earlier reports were correct and the company would be laying off employees. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Intel was preparing to lay off up to 20% of its current workforce. Given that Intel reported having 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, that 20% cut would equate to roughly just under 22,000 people being laid off. The 22,000 layoff figure, if accurate, would be larger than Intel’s last round of mass layoffs in August 2024, when then-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced 15,000 job cuts. Intel’s CEO confirmed the new job cuts in an email he sent to employees on April 24, which Intel then later published on its website. In the email, Tan laid out his desire for Intel to once again become an engineering-focused company so it can better compete in the chip marketplace and begin innovating again. But in order to refocus the company to one that is engineering-first, Tan said Intel will need to find ways to reduce its existing costs. Some of that cost reduction will come from layoffs. In a poorly subtitled section of his email called “Flattening the Organization,” Tan said he was “a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.” In order to refocus the company on engineering, Tan said, Intel would need to remove its organizational complexity and unnecessary bureaucracy. To this end, Tan said there was “no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce.” However, Tan didn’t state the size of this workforce reduction—neither in terms of the number of employees that will lose their jobs, nor in the percentage of Intel’s workforce that would be let go. That means it is currently unknown if Bloomberg’s 20% figure was correct. Fast Company has reached out to Intel for comment on the number of upcoming layoffs. What Tan did confirm is that the layoffs would happen in Q2—which is Intel’s current quarter. He also said that the company “will move as quickly as possible [with the layoffs] over the next several months.” Intel stock price sinks after Q1 earnings results But Intel employees weren’t the only ones who got bad news yesterday. Investors did, too. After Intel released its Q1 2025 numbers yesterday, the company’s stock (Nasdaq: INTC) is currently down a significant amount in premarket trading this morning. As of the time of this writing, INTC shares are currently down around 6.7% to just above $20 per share. INTC shares had gained 4.3% yesterday to close at $21.49 before the company revealed its Q1 performance. Unfortunately, investors usually see layoffs as a good thing for a company because when a company lets go of workers, it can save a lot of money. Fewer employees mean fewer associated costs. Yet still, INTC shares are down after the company’s Q1 results and layoffs confirmation. But why? Intel announced that its Q1 revenue was $12.7 billion—essentially flat year-over-year. It also reported a loss equal to 19 cents a share. But those disappointing numbers didn’t seem to bother investors as much as Intel’s quarterly forecast for its current Q2. Intel issued revenue guidance for its Q2 of $11.2 billion to $12.4 billion. But as Reuters notes, the analysts’ average estimate was $12.82 billion. Many investors thus saw the guidance as an admission from Intel that its turnaround effort will take time. The company is largely seen to have fumbled the opportunity to take advantage of the AI boom in the early years of this decade, and thus seeded AI chip dominance to Nvidia. Intel’s Tan is now hoping to make Intel into an AI chip juggernaut, but the company’s guidance suggests that’s not going to happen overnight—and certainly not in the next quarter. Until yesterday, Intel was one of the few major tech companies in America whose shares were up for the year. INTC closed yesterday at $21.49, up 7.18% for the year. But with its nearly 7% premarket decline this morning, INTC shares are now essentially flat for the year to date. Looking out to a longer timeline, INTC shares have performed much more poorly. As of yesterday’s close, INTC shares had fallen nearly 38% over the past 12 months. Over the past five years, INTC shares were down nearly 64% as of yesterday’s close.",

Intel's stock is down nearly 39% over the last year.Intel did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider'Lean, fast, and agile'Tan's 'do more with less' memo reflects a broader cultural crackdown across tech.Younger companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok are rethinking a US tech culture known for pandemic-era remote work, unlimited office perks, top-line pay, and job security.Intel also joins the rest of Big Tech in embracing the \"great flattening.\" Companies, including Meta, have cut middle-level management in favor of more streamlined teams and fewer tiers of hierarchy, which they think should lead to less bureaucracy.Across the industry, free massages and pet day care services have been replaced with memos filled with words such as \"efficiency\" and \"scrappiness and frugality.\" Tan, too, in his letter wrote: \"Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that's what we must become to improve our execution.\"Tan's note echoes memos that the CEOs of Amazon and Shopify sent to their employees.\"We want to operate like the world's largest startup,\" Amazon's Andy Jassy wrote in a September letter. \"That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration.\"In a memo to employees that Shopify's Toby Lütke shared on social media earlier this month, he wrote: \"In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Second-quarter revenue will be between $11.2 billion and $12.4 billion, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was well short of the $12.9 billion average analyst estimate, sending the shares down more than 6% in late trading. Alongside the results, Tan indicated that he’ll quickly be putting his stamp on Intel — and trying to energize a culture that he feels has become too bureaucratic. The cost-cutting plan will involve “eliminating management layers” to enable it to make faster decisions, Intel said.

Gelsinger was speaking about Nvidia on an episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid released on Monday.\"They are executing well,\" Gelsinger, who led Intel until December, said. \"At the end of the day, Jensen is on it — driving his teams to stay in the front end.\"Gelsinger said that Nvidia has managed to \"run hard to stay in the front\" in the silicon AI accelerator market. The market for AI chips made by Nvidia, Intel, and others has boomed because of huge spending from big companies and the explosion of AI startups.\"I can't throw a rock right without hitting a new AI startup in the Bay Area,\" Gelsinger said.The second thing Nvidia has done well is build \"meaningful moats,\" Gelsinger said. In business, a moat refers to a sustainable advantage that protects a company from competition.Gelsinger touted Nvidia's moats on products, including NVLink, a technology that lets multiple GPUs connect within a server, and CUDA, which speeds up computing applications by using GPUs.Generative AI explosionGelsinger worked at Intel for 30 years before he left the company for executive roles at Dell and VMware. He returned as Intel's CEO in 2021 and abruptly left in December. He is now a general partner at the venture capital firm Playground.Intel was Silicon Valley's dominant chipmaker in the 2000s. But it lost ground to Nvidia, Samsung, and several Taiwanese and American players, missing out on key tech developments like the rise of the iPhone and, more recently, skyrocketing artificial-intelligence demand. Companies such as Microsoft and Google have been designing their own chips, further limiting Intel's customer base.Intel's share price dropped almost 50% in 2024 as the company faced challenges, including billions of dollars in losses. Gelsinger responded with sweeping layoffs and buyouts.The US chipmaker's new CEO, electronics veteran Lip-Bu Tan, took over operations in March and acknowledged Intel's recent shortcomings in his first public appearance as CEO.\"We had been too slow to adapt and to meet your needs,\" Lip-Bu Tan said about customers on Monday at an Intel event in Las Vegas. \"You deserve better, and we need to improve, and we will.

        "description": "Shares in Nvidia Corporation and other chip technology companies are down in premarket trading this morning after Nvidia confirmed that it would take a significant financial hit to cover costs associated with a newly required export license so it can ship some of its latest chips outside of the United States. Here’s what you need to know about the new requirement and its effect on tech stocks. What’s happened? Yesterday, AI chipmaking giant Nvidia revealed that it will record a $5.5 billion charge this year related to its H20 chips, sending the stock down in premarket trading this morning. Nvidia made the revelation about a week after the Trump administration added new export license requirements to the H20. Nvidia initially revealed that information in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated April 9. In that filing, Nvidia revealed that the U.S. government now requires Nvidia to obtain an export license to export its H20 chips to China and select other countries. Due to this, Nvidia expects to incur about $5.5 billion in costs related to “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” of the H20. The H20 chip is a chip Nvidia designed especially for the Chinese marketplace in order to comply with U.S. export restrictions, notes CNBC. In 2024, Nvidia made between $12 billion and $15 billion selling the H20. But now the associated $5.5 billion charge will take a significant chunk out of those revenues. The Trump administration’s new export controls are also a sign that Nvidia could face an increasingly challenging environment when exporting its chips to countries that the U.S. believes could use them in ways that could disadvantage America. In Nvidia’s 8-K filing, the company said that the new export license requirement covers “the Company’s H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof” and that the United States government “indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” But China (including Hong Kong and Macau), isn’t the only country that the new export license requirement applies to. The license is also required for other so-called “D:5 countries.” According to a March 2024 publication by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, D:5 countries comprise over two dozen nations, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iran, Libya, Nicaragua, Russia, and Venezuela. On April 14, the United States government said the license requirement would “be in effect for the indefinite future,” according to Nvidia’s filing. Chip stocks fall The expected $5.5 billion charge related to Nvidia’s H20 chips has sent the stock tumbling nearly 6% in premarket trading this morning as of the time of this writing. Nvidia shares (Nasdaq: NVDA) are currently down around $6.45 to $105.75. However, it’s not just Nvidia shares that are down. The stock prices of chipmakers often move in unison—suggesting that most investors believe that what is good or bad for one company could be good or bad for the chip industry as a whole. The new export license requirement on Nvidia is a sign to many that U.S. chipmakers may see rougher waters ahead when it comes to exporting their products across the globe. Rougher export waters could lead to higher costs, reduced profits, or both. Other chipmakers this morning are currently seeing their stock price down, too, including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM): down 3% Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC): down 2.7% Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO): down 4% Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU): down 3.8% Arm Holdings plc (Nasdaq: ARM): down 4.8% QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM): down 2.2% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD): down 7% ASML warns about weaker orders However, the Nvidia news may not be the only thing dragging down these other chip companies. Currently, shares in the Dutch company ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML) are also down 4.7% in premarket trading as of the time of this writing. ASML isn’t a chip maker itself. It manufactures the critical machines that chipmakers need to produce their chips. As noted by the Wall Street Journal, ASML has now reported that orders for its machines that help make semiconductors totaled $4.45 billion in its first quarter. That was well below the $5.5 billion that analysts were expecting, suggesting a massive slowdown in once-expected production by chipmakers. ASML warned that President Trump’s policies were creating uncertainty for the semiconductor industry. Not including today’s premarket falls, companies operating in the semiconductor space have had a rough 2025 so far—not helped by Trump’s recent tariff policies and now, tightening export rules. As of market close yesterday, since the beginning of the year, NVDA shares were down 16.4%, TSM shares were down 21.4%, AVGO shares were down 22.8%, MU shares were down 15.5%, AMD shares were down 21.1%, and ARM shares were down 17.5%. Before today’s premarket drop, ASML shares were down 1.8% for the year.",

He’d been on the job for only 14 days, so this venue gave Lip-Bu his first opportunity to speak directly to Intel’s customers as a group and to tell them about his plans for the company. He started by providing some insight into his background. I’ve already covered this information in a previous article: “Lip-Bu Tan steps into the Intel CEO role. Can he save the company?”. Lip-Bu comes from an engineering background – nuclear engineering – and he solves problems like an engineer. He’s spent the last four decades as a successful venture capitalist, and his VC firm now manages $5 billion in investments. He focused his investing efforts on semiconductors long after the rest of the VC community turned its collective back on semiconductor startups. Lip-Bu prides himself on looking for opportunity where others aren’t, and he believes there’s still opportunity for Intel. That’s why he took on the job as the company’s latest CEO. Intel’s new CEO Lip_Bu Tan delivered his vision for the company in a keynote at Intel Vision on March 31. Image credit: Intel During his first two weeks as Intel’s CEO, Lip-Bu has been speaking with Intel’s customers and taking a deep dive into Intel’s engineering staff. During his keynote, he told the audience full of Intel’s customers that he wanted to speak to them as well, and he asked for the brutal truth. He wanted to know how Intel’s products were or were not delivering for them. He also warned that he’s not content with speaking with the top management during customer visits. He likes to go down as many as seven levels to get an accurate picture. Lip-Bu did this previously during his 14-year career as CEO at Cadence Design Systems. As he stated during his keynote, “I always want to have my customers, my team, my partners, my wife to give me the truth. Likewise, they also expect me to give them the truth. Then we can fix problems together and move forward as a team.” Lip-Bu spent two years on Intel’s board but resigned in the middle of 2024. Now he’s back, and he’s talking to his internal teams to discover the ground truth at the company he now leads. Lip-Bu obliquely described what he’s uncovered and then gave the long-range vision he has for Intel: “We’re going to refocus the company on the essential ingredients of innovation. Clearly, I need to focus on strengthening my balance sheets, and I need to really drive efficiency. I need to regroup the talent we have and attract some new talent, with a clear vision of what we’re going to do. “Innovation starts with incubation. We are a big company that sometimes prevents new ideas from having room to develop and grow. I like to practice a startup, day-one culture, and we’re going to work as a day-one startup – a big startup. Then, we’re going to really drive some new ideas, giving engineers the freedom to innovate from within. My weekends are usually packed with [talking to] a lot of engineers and architects. They have some brilliant ideas. They want to change the world, and that’s where I get excited to work closely with them. I will put resources behind people and ideas where we can see the opportunity to innovate. We can free some of [Intel’s] infrastructure to really drive innovation and empower them. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast, innovate, and take on incumbents. We’re going to practice that. We may not be perfect in the beginning, but eventually you can count on it. I will make it perfect. This will unleash the potential that I know exists across my team. It will also help us attract new talent from the outside. They can join us, and enter this most exciting period of creating innovation, and creating the new Intel.” Then, Lip-Bu addressed his customers in the audience directly: “Some of you know my email address. If you are interested, call me. I will spend time with you.” After discussing the shortcomings he saw in Intel’s organization, Lip-Bu spoke about the key technological opportunities he sees for the company: “We are operating in a very dynamic, fast-moving industry. Technology adoptions and disruption are accelerating faster than ever. This is being driven by one transformation force called AI. “AI is not new, but with massive [amounts of] data available, you can really drive some new ways of learning, new ways of interpreting, and new ways to even forecast the future. This is really reshaping many of the companies I’m involved with, and [it’s] shaping our daily life. Can you imagine having an agent help you to decide and remove some of the mundane processes [you need to do]? I love agents… “AI is driving a total architectural change to computing, especially in cloud computing. No code, low code, you know, software 2.0… This [change] is driving hyperscalers’ innovation. Massive computational power and new data capacity will accelerate us to move forward. [In addition,] some of the infrastructure, as I mentioned earlier, is moving into the photonics area. Also, I have invested in three quantum computing companies [through his VC firm]. This is coming and I keep a very close eye on it. [Quantum computing] will come sooner than we all thought. “AI is also revolutionizing how we discover, create, and interact with content through agentic AI [AI systems that can act autonomously, adapt in real-time, and solve multi-step problems] and intelligent agents. Some of my friends are really working on [this] and are talking to me. We would love to have an Intel computer platform that we can build on for all of this… “AI is also expanding into the physical world. You may have heard of humanoid robotics. I’m a very big fan of that. This is the new frontier. It will redefine industrials… It will create a new era of robotics and intelligent systems embedded everywhere around us. “I have a lot of experience in these areas. Stay tuned.” So, there you have it, directly from Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. He wants to clean up the bureaucracy and management structure within Intel (here’s looking at you, Processor Mafia), and as a futurist, he’s setting his sights on meeting the needs of future applications with a streamlined engineering team. Not once in his keynote did Lip-Bu say the word “marketing.” That’s because it’s not in his nature. Redirecting a company that’s come to rely on marketing, with advertisements that show people dancing in multicolored bunny suits and portray engineers as rock stars, to a semiconductor company that’s once again focused on leading-edge excellence and on-time delivery, is going to be a monumental task. Here’s hoping Lip-Bu and Intel are up to the task.",

Here are this week’s top news in AI: Google’s Head of Gemini Steps Down Google has replaced the executive in charge of Gemini, Sissie Hsiao, with Josh Woodward, the head of Google Labs who launched viral sensation NotebookLM. Despite Google’s early AI breakthroughs, like inventing the Transformer model, Gemini lags far behind ChatGPT, which holds nearly 60% of the U.S. chatbot market. Gemini has dropped to 13.5%, falling behind both ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot (which uses ChatGPT). Hsiao will take a short break and return to Google in a new role. Google faces a challenge it hasn’t seen since the 1990s, when it overtook Yahoo in search. Now, rivals like OpenAI and Perplexity are also pushing into Google’s search territory using AI tools. Although Google acted quickly after ChatGPT launched — even tasking Hsiao to build a rival in just 100 days — its cautious rollout left it trailing. Still, with Gemini 2.5’s advanced multimodal capabilities and Google’s custom AI chips, the company hopes to regain lost ground. Read more: Google Replaces Gemini Head After Lagging AI Performance Intel CEO: ‘We Have Fallen Short’ Intel’s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan outlined a plan to revive the legendary chipmaker, which had fallen on hard times by failing to keep development deadlines, innovating slowly and sticking to a rigid, hardware-first culture. The company recently reported its largest quarterly loss and laid off 15,000 employees. In a speech at Intel’s conference this week, Tan admitted the company had let customers down and called this a “defining moment.” He promised to rebuild trust and asked customers to be “brutally honest” with their feedback. Tan’s plan is to fix the culture, strengthen the core business, grow in new areas and rebuild customer trust. He wants Intel to act more like a startup: fast, creative and focused on solving real problems. He plans to cut bureaucracy, meet directly with engineers and focus on AI, including cloud, generative and robotics. Intel plans to spin off non-core businesses. More here: Intel’s New CEO Vows to Reform Outdated Development Model House GOP, Democrats Square off At a House subcommittee hearing this week, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged the benefits of AI but clashed over how to regulate it. Subcommittee Chair Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., argued for a “light touch” regulatory approach, saying that free enterprise and open competition is the best path for innovation. He warned against adopting regulations similar to those in China or the EU, saying they could stifle American innovation. But Ranking Member Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., expressed concern over AI’s concentration in the hands of a few dominant companies. He urged the adoption of robust oversight, particularly by the Federal Trade Commission, to protect consumers and prevent unfair business practices.

The updates let users get trip ideas from a personal AI assistant, track hotel prices and automatically save places they want to visit on Maps. Analysts say travel is a critical area for Google since many people use its search feature to plan trips. Meanwhile, Perplexity is stepping up its game by partnering with Tripadvisor and Selfbook to let users book hotels directly through its AI chatbot. It also plans to offer hotel discounts, among other features. Other travel companies like Booking.com are using AI models from OpenAI to help travelers, giving people more planning options outside of Google. Get the story: Travelers’ Reliance on AI Prompts Google to Enhance Search, Maps and Tools Harvard: AI Can Replicate Teamwork A Harvard-led study found that GenAI can effectively act as a teammate in the workplace. In a real-world experiment with 776 Procter & Gamble employees, individuals using AI performed as well as two-person teams without AI. They generated better product ideas faster, with those using AI three times more likely to create top-ranked solutions. The study showed that AI boosted productivity, improved idea quality and helped less experienced workers match their more experienced peers. Beyond productivity, AI also helped break down knowledge silos within teams. Employees began thinking beyond their usual areas of expertise — commercial staff suggested more technical solutions, while R&D staff included more market-focused ideas. The AI encouraged broader thinking and even boosted participants’ positive experiences with it — meaning it is both useful and acts as a social partner. These findings suggest that AI could reshape how companies structure teams and share knowledge.

Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is clear-eyed about the chipmaker’s many problems and the tough road ahead as he engineers a turnaround to revive this legendary Silicon Valley company. “This is an iconic and essential company that is important for the industry and also to the United States,” Tan said in a keynote address at Intel’s conference in Las Vegas this week. The nuclear physicist, who dropped out of the Ph.D. program at MIT, is best known for transforming Cadence Design Systems into a robust chip design and software company. He was also a board member at Intel. “We fell behind on innovation. We have been too slow to adapt to meet your needs. You deserve better, and we need to improve, and we will,” Tan told his audience of customers and vendors. “Please be brutally honest with us.” Tan called this juncture a “defining moment” for the legendary chipmaker. Fall From Dominance Intel was once the world’s most valuable chipmaker — a crown that would go to Nvidia. With its “Intel Inside” branding, it was the first chipmaker to become a household name. In the 1990s, Intel and Windows became so dominant in PCs that the pair were called “Wintel.” Intel founder Gordon Moore’s “Moore’s Law” still stands 60 years after it was created. Intel’s troubles began in the mid-2010s, when it started missing key product deadlines and struggled to advance to 10nm manufacturing, allowing rivals like TSMC and AMD to overtake it in performance and efficiency. Once the industry leader, Intel became hampered by internal bureaucracy, a rigid culture, and a hardware-first mindset that lagged behind a software- and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven future, while competitors like ARM and Nvidia thrived. Intel also famously turned down Apple’s request to make chips for the iPhone, paving the way for Qualcomm. In the third quarter of 2024, Intel posted its largest quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, including a $15.9 billion charge to reflect lower valuations and costs to lay off 15,000 employees. Now there are even reports of Intel as a takeover target — humiliating for a tech icon. “Intel Corp.’s fall from market dominance to takeover target is a tale marked by missed opportunities and rising expenses,” wrote Iuri Struta, senior research associate at S&P Global Market Intelligence, in a blog post. In 2020, Intel was the second most valuable chipmaker. As of last September, it had fallen to 14th place, he said. Tan understands the enormity of his task to turn around Intel. “We have a lot of hard work ahead. We have fallen short of your expectations. I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust,” he said. “I will not be satisfied until we delight all of you.” Read more: Intel Faces Potential Breakup as Broadcom and TSMC Explore Deals Intel’s Plan Tan faces a big challenge in reviving a company with decades of inertia to lead in a market that now moves at hyperspeed. His four areas of focus are: changing the culture, strengthening the core business, incubating and growing new business, and building customer trust. Tan said he will bring Intel back to its roots: an engineering-focused company. He promised to meet with engineers even six to seven levels down from the C-suite to hear their ideas and unleash their creativity. Tan also promised to retain and attract key talent, which had been leaving Intel. Tan said Intel needs to adopt a startup culture to innovate, where every day is Day One. His weekends are filled with meetings with engineers and software architects who have “brilliant” ideas and who “want to change the world. That’s when I get excited to work closely with them,” Tan said. Tan also plans to simplify the way Intel works because “bureaucracy kills innovation.” The startup mindset will enable them to act with speed. “We are operating in a very dynamic, fast-moving industry. Technology adoptions and disruption are accelerating faster than ever. This is being driven by the one transformational force called AI,” Tan said. Intel will target three AI areas: cloud AI, generative and agentic AI, and physical AI such as robotics. To that end, Tan said Intel will spin off non-core business divisions but did not name which ones. To right its operations, Tan said Intel must change the way it makes products. The company used to start by making hardware — chips — and then developing the software to make it work. “The world has changed. You have to flip that around,” Tan said. “You start with the problem, what you’re trying to solve. … Then we work backwards from there.” Tan also addressed Intel’s product and foundry priorities. In client computing, he reaffirmed a commitment to innovation, noting the competitive landscape has shifted and Intel must not “stand still.” Pushing forward with AI-enhanced PCs, the company aims to ship its next-generation Panther Lake processors on its 18A process node later this year. Perhaps most critically, Tan confirmed Intel’s ambitions to manufacture chips for customers around the world. “Foundry is a service business that is built on the foundational principle of trust,” he said. At this stage in his career, Tan said he has been asked why he would take on one of the most difficult jobs in tech. “The answer is very simple. I love this company,” Tan said, with tears in his eyes. “It was very hard for me to watch it struggle. I simply cannot stay on the sidelines knowing that I could help turn things around.” Photo: Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

        "description": "2025 has kicked off with a flurry of GPU activity. 2025 has kicked off with a flurry of GPU activity. Intel's Arc B580 revealed that it's still possible to make a mid-range GPU with more than 8 GB of VRAM. AMD's RDNA 4 marked the continuation of a longstanding AMD practice where they reach for the top-end, before deciding it wasn't worth it after all. Nvidia too has a new generation to celebrate 2025, and their 5000 series launch has come and gone without cards on shelves. But bigger numbers are better, so it's time to talk about the GeForce 6 series.Gamers demand higher quality graphics with each generation. No one knows this better than Nvidia, so GeForce 6000 series cards are built to deliver near-cinematic quality at framerates high enough to support interactive gameplay. GeForce 6000 GPUs, or the GeForce 6 series for short, are built with the highly parallel nature of graphics rendering in mind. At the same time, they take a great leap forward in terms of programmability, opening up exciting new possibilities for complex in-game effects.OverviewGraphics rendering involves transforming vertex coordinates from 3D space to 2D screen space before calculating the final pixel colors, a process known as rasterization. Both stages are inherently parallel tasks, and map well to hardware with large arrays of execution units. Accordingly, a GeForce 6 series GPU is a massively parallel machine. It has a strong complement of fixed-function graphics hardware, but the real power of the GPU lies in a collection of vertex and pixel shader cores. These programmable components execute shader programs provided by the game instead of carrying out preset functions. They also serve as basic building blocks, letting Nvidia scale to different power, price, and performance targets. The highest end GeForce 6000 series chip, NV40, implements 6 vertex shader and 16 pixel shader cores.From Nvidia’s IEEE paperA highly parallel machine needs a high bandwidth memory subsystem to keep it fed. GeForce 6 series products can feature up to a 256-bit GDDR3 DRAM setup, giving it significantly more memory bus width than typical desktop CPUs. The GPU features a L2 texture cache shared across all pixel and vertex shader cores, which enables short-term reuse of fetched texture data. Nvidia did not disclose cache sizes at this time, but they aim for a 90% hitrate with many misses in flight, rather than the 99% hitrate one often sees with CPU caches. The GPU communicates with the host system via the popular AGP interface, but can also support the upcoming PCI Express standard.Vertex Shader CoreVertex shader programs transform coordinates from 3D to 2D screen space. It may sound like a trivial task that involves little more than a camera matrix multiplication and perspective division. But programmable vertex shaders open up new tricks. For example, a vertex shader can sample a texture and use it as a displacement map. Besides supporting texture accesses, GeForce 6000's vertex shader cores support branches, loops, and function calls. Much of this capability was previously unthinkable on anything outside a real CPU, demonstrating the exciting nature of GPU evolution.Vertex shader execution starts with instruction fetch from a 512-entry instruction RAM. Nvidia uses 128-bit vertex instructions from the driver format, which are translated into a 123-bit internal format. Thus the instruction RAM has approximately 8 KB of capacity. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 standard mandates a minimum of 512 instruction slots, and Nvidia's vertex shader core ISA is closely aligned to DirectX 9's HLSL instructions. Thanks to instruction limits, shader programs are immune to performance losses from instruction cache misses, which CPU programs can often suffer. Furthermore, accessing the instruction RAM doesn't involve tag comparisons like a cache would, saving power.GeForce 6000 Vertex Shader instruction layout, inferred from Mesa codeDirectX 9 vertex shader HLSL instructions broadly fall into scalar and vector categories. Scalar instructions include special operations like inverse square roots. Vector instructions generally involve basic operations like multiply-add, and operate on 128-bit vectors of four 32-bit values. GeForce 6000's vertex shader pipeline is highly optimized for this arrangement, and features separate vector and scalar pipelines. Each ISA instruction specifies both a scalar and vector operation, letting the vertex shader core exploit parallelism in two dimensions within one instruction stream. Vectors specified by the DirectX 9 shader program provide vector-level parallelism. Any scalar+vector dual issue opportunities found by Nvidia's compiler provide additional parallelism.A third source of parallelism comes from multithreading, and serves to hide latency. The vector operation slot can accept texture sampling instructions. Memory accesses from a vertex shader should still be relatively uncommon, so vertex shader cores don't have a L1 texture cache tied to their texture fetch unit. Nvidia expects a shader program will need 20-30 instructions to hide texture fetch latency, which can be hard to achieve from a single thread. Therefore, vertex shader cores can each track up to three threads and switch between them to hide latency.Instruction inputs can come from registers or constant RAM. Both consist of 128-bit vector entries to match vector execution width. Register files are split into input, output, and temporary registers. The input and output registers each have 16 entries, and are read-only or write-only respectively from the shader program's point of view. The temporary register file supports both reads and writes, and has 32 entries. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 specification lets a shader program address up to 32 registers, but Nvidia might share the register file between multiple threads. If so, a vertex shader program should use no more than 10 temporary registers to achieve maximum occupancy.Pixel Shader CorePixel shaders, or fragment shaders, do much of the heavy lifting because rendering a scene typically involves processing far more pixels than vertices. Accordingly, a GeForce 6000 GPU can have up to 16 pixel shader cores. The pixel shader cores themselves are highly programmable just like the vertex shader cores, with branching support among other goodies. However, pixel shader cores are built very differently to exploit increased parallelism typically present at the pixel level.GeForce 6000's pixel shaders use 128-bit instructions, though the encoding is substantially different from the one used in vertex shaders thanks to hardware differences. Nvidia has chosen to support up to 65536 pixel shader instructions, exceeding the DirectX 9 minimum specification of 512 instruction slots by a wide margin. Using all instruction slots would consume 1 MB of storage, so pixel shader cores might use an instruction cache.The fragment processor has two fp32 shader units per pipeline, and fragments are routed through both shader units and the branch processor before recirculating through the entire pipeline to execute the next series of instructionsFrom The Geforce 6 Series GPU Architecture, Emmet Kilgariff and Ramdima FernandoWhere Nvidia's vertex shader core operates much like a CPU with 3-way SMT to hide latency, the pixel shader core uses a SIMD execution model across threads. That parallelism, often referred to as SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread), applies on top of the SIMD you get within a thread from using multi-component vectors. Rather than tracking three separate threads, Nvidia groups many pixel shader invocations into a vector and effectively loops through the \"threads\" in hardware. This approach lets Nvidia keep thousands of \"threads\" in flight at low cost, because threads in the same vector must execute the same instruction and cannot take an independent execution path from other threads. Only the data being processed is different.Programmers must pay attention to divergence penalties with this SIMT threading model. If different threads within a vector take different directions on a conditional branch, the pixel shader core will execute both sides of the branch with non-active threads masked off. That contrasts with the vertex shader core's MIMD execution model, which allows penalty free branching even if branch directions diverge across threads running in the same core. Nvidia suggests keeping branches coherent across regions of over 1000 pixels, or approximately 256 2x2 pixel quads, hinting at very long vector lengths.Keeping that much work in flight is critical to hiding latency, but places pressure on internal chip storage. DirectX 9 lets pixel shaders address 32 temporary registers, which continue to be 128-bits wide. Keeping 256 threads in flight would require 128 KB of register file capacity per pixel shader core, which will not be achieved in GPUs for several years. GeForce 6000 uses smaller register files of unknown size. Nvidia says pixel shader programs can get the maximum number of threads in flight if they use four or fewer 128-bit registers. As ballpark estimate, 256 threads with four registers per thread would require 16 KB of register file capacity.The pixel shader core's two 128-bit vector units are placed one after another in different pipeline stages. Both can execute four FP32 operations per cycle, though only the lower one can do multiply-add. The upper one can handle special functions and texture address calculation. Texture operations are issued between the two execution unit stages. Peak FP32 throughput is 12 operations per cycle. That can be achieved for example by issuing a vector FP32 multiply in the upper stage and a FP32 multiply-add in the lower one.From a shader program's perspective, the upper and lower vector units together can complete two vector operations per cycle. Compared to the vertex shader cores, the pixel shader's sequential \"dual issue\" arrangement lets the upper unit forward its re",

Can he save the company?\" The question in my headline is a bit of a tease. Intel doesn’t need saving, per se, but its reputation sure needs a makeover, and the company’s new CEO – Lip-Bu Tan – certainly has the chops and smarts to rebuild the financial community’s and the electronics industry’s trust in the once (and future?) semiconductor leader. Many pundits have opined already about Intel’s new CEO, so why trust my opinion? I’ve got experience working for a company run by Tan during his years as Cadence’s CEO, so I don’t need to guess. My closest work friend at Cadence was David Thon, who worked directly with CEO Tan and often told me how the man operates. I spent 18 months at Cadence and another two years working for Intel, so I’ve seen stuff and I know things. Tan was born in Malaysia and earned a BS in physics at Nanyang University in Singapore. He focused on quantum physics. Because the energy crisis was big at the time, he decided to study nuclear engineering and was working on a PhD at MIT when the Three Mile Island accident occurred. Tan quickly changed gears, got an MS in nuclear engineering, and started working for EDS Nuclear in San Francisco at the age of 19. He then joined a startup consulting firm called ECHO Energy, which needed a CFO. Tan became the CFO by default, and the company sent him to the University of San Francisco (USF) to get an MBA. Industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan has taken over as Intel’s CEO as of March 18. Image credit: Intel During his last MBA class at USF, Tan met a senior partner at Chappell & Company, which specialized in financing startup companies. Because of his technical background, the partners invited Tan to work for them part time and immediately put him to work reading and evaluating business plans from companies seeking venture funding. He read 1000 business plans. Eventually, ECHO Energy was sold and Tan became a full-time Assistant VP at Chappell & Company. Five days later, he took charge of private placements at the firm. Tan had launched his career as a venture capitalist. A year and a half later, Tan was ready to launch his own venture firm and founded Walden International in 1987 along with two established venture partners, Art Berliner and George Sarlo. Walden International’s first investment was Mouse Systems, an early vendor of optical mice. (I was an early customer of Mouse Systems at Cadnetix in the early 1980s.) Tan spent six months as an interim CEO of Mouse Systems while the company searched for a permanent CEO. It was his first taste of being a CEO. When KYE Systems of Taiwan bought Mouse Systems in 1990, Tan invested in KYE, which triggered a series of investments in Asian companies by Walden International. Asian investments were a natural fit, given Tan’s background, although he explains in his oral history that it was just an excuse to visit his mother in Singapore. Soon, Walden International had made investments in companies located in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. According to Tan, Walden International was one of the first companies to bring the concept of venture capital to Asia. Initially, Tan focused Walden International’s investments on technology, but he’s sharpened the focus to the semiconductor industry for the last two decades because he views semiconductors as foundational technology. It’s the killer app, he explains in his oral history. In 2008, Cadence’s interim CEO Ray Bingham invited Tan to replace the outgoing Mike Fister as Cadence’s CEO. He reluctantly agreed to a three-month stint as “acting” CEO, then made the job permanent in January 2009. Then, in true Lip-Bu Tan style, he visited 1500 Cadence customers, and consequently learned a lot about the company’s strengths and weaknesses Tan stayed on as Cadence’s CEO for well more than a decade. He stepped down from the CEO position in 2021, more than a decade after taking on the job as “acting CEO.” It was a long acting gig. Meanwhile, Walden International continued to invest in semiconductor startups and, over time, Tan has met most of the players in the semiconductor industry. He likely has the direct phone number for every CEO of every important Cadence customer on one of the two mobile phones he keeps on his belt, and he maintains those relationships personally. It’s no wonder that interim Executive Chair Frank D. Yeary, who took on that role during Intel’s search for a new CEO, said this about Tan: ““Like many across the industry, I have worked closely with Lip-Bu in the past and have seen firsthand how his relentless attention to customers drives innovation and success.” On LinkedIn, Ahmadreza Farsaei, a principal software engineer currently working at Intel, provided a similar perspective, but from the trenches: “During my time at Cadence, I had the opportunity to witness Lip-Bu Tan leadership up close. What stood out the most was his ability to balance vision with humility – always pushing for innovation while staying deeply engaged with the people driving it. As we worked on advancing our photonic solution, I saw firsthand how he encouraged bold thinking, challenged the status quo, and recognized the potential of emerging technologies.” I’ve read pundits who say that Lip-Bu Tan lacks semiconductor experience. I don’t believe that for one second, and you shouldn’t either. Although Tan isn’t a process guy, he’s an information sponge, a physicist, and a nuclear engineer. He’s spent decades absorbing the ins and outs of semiconductor manufacturing. He has learned the technical and business details of making semiconductors because he had to know that sort of information to evaluate potential venture opportunities for Walden International. Because it supplies EDA tools to nearly every company that designs and/or manufactures ICs, Cadence must maintain close relationships with the world’s semiconductor foundries and independent device manufacturers, including deep relationships with many companies in Intel’s extended ecosystem, and Lip-Bu Tan was the number one person at Cadence who was responsible for maximizing the benefits of those relationships. His experience will directly benefit Intel as the company tries to establish itself as a major semiconductor foundry through Intel Foundry Services (IFS). As the new CEO of Intel, Tan is stepping into the world’s largest semiconductor duopoly, the severely SKUed world of x86 processors, which envelops Intel and AMD. Tan has spent more than a decade dealing with a similar duopoly, in the EDA arena: Cadence and Synopsys. You can bet that Tan has learned more than a few things about dealing with a heavyweight competitor. I fully expect Tan to apply those lessons as he faces off against CEO Lisa Su at AMD. Again, Tan seems more than up to the task. There are some pundits calling for Intel, with Tan at the head, to immediately release some sort of effective competition for Nvidia GPUs, a market that Intel has badly fumbled. Even if Intel were to introduce a fabulous GPU or AI chip tomorrow, the silicon is useless without software and an infrastructure to support that software. Nvidia’s proprietary Cuda programming language acts as a nearly insurmountable barrier – a wall – against simple competitive moves in the AI space. I don’t expect to see a quick remedy for Intel’s trailing position in the AI arena. Intel can’t even buy its way out of this problem because there’s no worthy Nvidia competitor to buy that could possibly catapult Intel into a leadership position in the AI segment. Intel has bought three AI companies so far, by my count, and the results have produced nothing but red ink. Don’t go looking for miracles here. On the other hand, there are already published accounts of a major managerial restructuring in the works. A Reuters article by Max A. Cherney (see “Exclusive: Intel’s new CEO plots overhaul of manufacturing and AI operations“) posits that Tan may take an ax or, as has suddenly become popular, a chainsaw to Intel’s middle management. That’s certainly not beyond the scope of things Tan might do. As an experienced VC, he’s quite used to downsizing staff to make a company’s numbers work.. He may also find Intel’s marketing departments to be excessively large, especially because Tan is quite accustomed to operating as a one-person marketing department. Tan’s oral history was taken while he was Cadence’s CEO, long before his new gig at Intel. In that oral history, Tan describes the management philosophy he brought to Cadence, which is undoubtedly what he’ll bring to Intel: “I used to play basketball and volleyball on college teams, and I have always believed in the ‘one team’ culture. So, the company [Cadence] was quite dysfunctional, with a lot of silos, and I tried to change it to a one-team culture, so that we could work as one team. That’s one big thing I focused on, and today, I still focus on. Secondly, it’s important to listen to the customer and then put customer focus as the number one priority, to make sure that we are very focused on delighting the customer. Thirdly, I put my VC training to work. If you are behind, you have to leapfrog the competition. You have to recruit the best talent and then make sure that you have a plan to leapfrog the competition by changing your designs to be better.” That sure sounds like a dose of what Intel needs to get back at least some of the company’s lost mojo.",

Lyft plans to start adding autonomous vehicles (AVs) to its ridesharing platform as soon as this summer. “We recently signed agreements with partners like May Mobility, Mobileye and Marubeni to start rolling out AVs on our platform as soon as this summer,” Jeremy Bird, executive vice president of driver experience at Lyft, wrote in a Thursday (March 20) blog post. “And over time, AVs will account for a larger share of cars, and a larger percentage of rides.” Bird wrote this in a blog post addressing how the debut of AVs may affect the drivers who offer rides through the platform. He wrote that while Lyft doesn’t have all the answers, the company expects that there will still be opportunities for drivers because the addition of AVs won’t necessarily mean there will be fewer rides to be served by drivers. “Adding cars to our platform — whether they’re driven by humans or AVs — improves arrival times and creates a better rider experience,” Bird wrote. “That gets people to take more rides, creating more opportunities for drivers.” Lyft CEO David Risher wrote a blog post in February focusing on the rideshare company’s role in the emerging AV ecosystem. Risher wrote that the company expects to contribute its core competencies having to do with asset ownership and financing, fleet management, the mobility platform and marketplace, and rider demand and experience. “Our world-class fleet management, sophisticated marketplace engine and large-scale demand represent the best way for AV companies, OEM manufacturers and fleet owners to commercialize their assets,” Risher wrote. “We partner with those companies to bring exceptional autonomous transportation experiences to riders at scale.” It was reported in February that Lyft aimed to bring autonomous robotaxis to its app in 2026. The company said at the time that the robotaxi service would launch first in Dallas, with the goal of scaling the service to thousands of vehicles across multiple cities following that rollout. Risher said during a Feb. 11 earnings call: “AVs will be a transformational addition to the marketplace. “We’ll start in Dallas and we do expect to move into other markets.” The post Lyft May Add Autonomous Vehicles to Ridesharing Platform This Summer appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

        "description": "Examining software changes for hints on what Intel's next GPU architecture may bring Intel’s foray into high performance graphics has enjoyed impressive progress over the past few years, and the company is not letting up on the gas. Tom Peterson from Intel has indicated that Xe3 hardware design is complete, and software work is underway. Some of that software work is visible across several different open source repositories, offering a preview of what’s to come.GPU Organization: Larger Render Slices?Modern GPUs are built from a hierarchy of subdivision levels, letting them scale to hit different performance, power and price targets. A shader program running on an Intel GPU can check where it’s running by reading the low bits of the sr0 (state register 0) architectural register.sr0 topology bits on Xe3 have a different layout1. Xe Cores within a Render Slice are enumerated with four bits, up from two in prior generations. Thus Xe3’s topology bits would be able to handle a Render Slice with up to 16 Xe Cores. Prior Xe generations could only have four Xe Cores per Render Slice, and often went right up to that. The B580 and A770 both placed four Xe Cores in each Render Slice.Having enough bits to describe a certain configuration doesn’t mean Intel will ship something that big. Xe did use its maximum 32 core, 4096 lane setup in the Arc A770. However, Xe2 maxed out at 20 cores and 2560 lanes with the Arc B580. Xe2’s sr0 format could theoretically enumerate 16 slices. Giving each slice the maximum of 4 Xe Cores would make a 64 Xe Core GPU with 8192 FP32 lanes. Obviously the B580 doesn’t get anywhere near that.Visualizing the shader array on a hypothetical giant Xe2 implementation that maxes out all topology enumeration bitsXe3 goes even further. Maxing out all the topology enumeration bits would result in a ludicrously large 256 Xe Core configuration with 32768 FP32 lanes. That’s even larger than Nvidia’s RTX 5090, which “only” has 21760 FP32 lanes. Intel has been focusing on the midrange segment for a while, and I doubt we’ll see anything that big.Instead, I think Intel wants more flexibility to scale compute power independently of fixed function hardware like ROPs and rasterizers. AMD and Nvidia’s SAs and GPCs all pack a lot more than four cores. For example, the RX 6900XT’s Shader Arrays each have 10 WGPs. Nvidia’s RTX 4090 puts eight SMs in each GPC. GPUs have become more compute-heavy over time, as games use more complex shader programs. Intel seems to be following the same trend.XVE ChangesXe Vector Engines (XVEs) execute shader programs on Intel GPUs. They use a combination of vector-level and thread-level parallelism to hide latency.Higher Occupancy, Increased ParallelismXe3 XVEs can run 10 threads concurrently, up from eight in prior generations. Like SMT on a CPU, tracking multiple threads helps a XVE hide latency using thread level parallelism. If one thread stalls, the XVE can hopefully find an un-stalled thread to issue instructions from. Active thread count is also referred to as thread occupancy. 100% occupancy on a GPU would be analogous to 100% utilization in Windows Task Manager. Unlike CPU SMT implementations, GPU occupancy can be limited by register file capacity.Prior Intel GPUs had two register allocation modes. Normally each thread gets 128 512-bit registers, for 8 KB of registers per thread. A “large GRF” mode gives each thread 256 registers, but drops occupancy to 4 threads because of register file capacity limits. Xe3 continues to use 64 KB register files per XVE, but flexibly allocates registers in 32 entry blocks2. That lets Xe3’s XVEs get 10 threads in flight as long as each thread uses 96 or fewer registers. If a shader program needs a lot of registers, occupancy degrades more gracefully than in prior generations.Nvidia and AMD GPUs allocate registers at even finer granularity. AMD’s RDNA 2 for example allocates registers in blocks of 16. But Xe3 is still more flexible than prior Intel generations. With this change, simple shaders that only need a few registers will enjoy better latency tolerance from more thread-level parallelism. And more complex shaders can avoid dropping to the “large GRF” mode.Xe3’s XVEs have more scoreboard tokens too. Like AMD and Nvidia, Intel uses compiler assisted scheduling for long latency instructions like memory accesses. A long latency instruction can set a scoreboard entry, and a dependent instruction can wait until that entry is cleared. Each Xe3 thread gets 32 scoreboard tokens regardless of occupancy, so a XVE has 320 scoreboard tokens in total. On Xe2, a thread gets 16 tokens if the XVE is running eight threads, or 32 in “large GRF” mode with four threads. Thus Xe2’s XVEs only have 128 scoreboard tokens in total. More tokens let thread have more outstanding long latency instructions. That very likely translates to more memory level parallelism per thread.“Scalar” Register (s0)Intel’s GPU ISA has a vector register file (GRF, or General Register File) that stores much of a shader program’s data and feeds the vector execution units. It also has an “Architecture Register File” (ARF) with special registers. Some of those can store data, like the accumulator registers. But others serve special purposes. For example, sr0 as mentioned above provides GPU topology info, along with floating point exception state and thread priority. A 32-bit instruction pointer points to the current instruction address, relative to the instruction base address.Notes on Intel’s ARF, with changes from Xe2 to Xe3 in blueXe3 adds a “Scalar Register” (s0) to the ARF6. s0 is laid out much like the address register (a0), and is used for gather-send instructions. XVEs access memory and communicate with other shared using by sending messages over the Xe Core’s message fabric, using send instructions. Gather-send appears to let Xe3 gather non-contiguous values from the register file, and send them with a single send instruction.Besides adding the Scalar Register, Xe3 extends the thread dependency register (TDR) to handle 10 threads. sr0 gains an extra 32-bit doubleword for unknown reasons.Instruction ChangesXe3 supports a saturation modifier for FCVT, an instruction that converts between different floating point types (not between integer and floating point). FCVT was introduced with Ponte Vecchio, but the saturation modifier could ease conversion from higher to lower precision floating point formats. Xe3 also gains HF8 (half float 8-bit) format support, providing another 8-bit floating point format option next to the BF8 type already supported in Xe2.For the XMX unit, Xe3 gains a xdpas instruction4. sdpas stands for sparse systolic dot product with accumulate5. Matrices with a lot of zero elements are known as sparse matrices. Operations on sparse matrices can be optimized because anything multiplied by zero is obviously zero. Nvidia and AMD GPUs have both implemented sparsity optimizations, and Intel is apparently looking to do the same.Raytracing: Sub-Triangle Opacity CullingSub-Triangle Opacity Culling (STOC) subdivides triangles in BVH leaf nodes, and marks sub-triangles as transparent, opaque, or partially transparent. The primary motivation is to reduce wasted any-hit shader work when games use texture alpha channels to handle complex geometry. Intel’s paper calls out foliage as an example, noting that programmers may use low vertex counts to reduce “rendering, animation, and even simulation run times.”7 BVH geometry from the API perspective can only be completely transparent or opaque, so games mark all partially transparent primitives as transparent. Each ray intersection will fire an any-hit shader, which carries out alpha testing. If alpha testing indicates the ray intersected a transparent part of the primitive, the shader program doesn’t contribute a sample and the any-hit shader launch is basically wasted. STOC bits let the any-hit shader skip alpha testing if the ray intersects a completely transparent or completely opaque sub-triangle.From Intel's paper, showing examples of foliage texturesStoring each sub-triangle’s opacity information takes two bits, so STOC does require more storage compared to using a single opacity bit for the entire triangle. Still, it’s far more practical than packing entire textures into the BVH. Intel’s paper found that a software-only STOC implementation improved performance by 5.9-42.2% compared to standard alpha tests when handling translucent ray-traced shadows.Elden Ring's BVH represents tree leaves in Leyndell using larger triangles, as seen in Radeon Raytracing Analyzer. STOC may map well to this scenarioSTOC-aware raytracing hardware can provide further gains, especially with Intel's raytracing implementation. Intel's raytracing acceleration method closely aligns with the DXR 1.0 standard. A raytracing accelerator (RTA) autonomously handles traversal and launches hit/miss shaders by sending messages to the Xe Core's thread dispatcher. STOC bits could let the RTA skip shader launches if the ray intersects a completely transparent sub-triangle. For an opaque sub-triangle, the RTA can tell the shader program to skip alpha testing, and terminate the ray early.Illustrating the problem STOC tries to solve. Yes I used rectangles, but I wanted to use the same leaf texture outline as Intel's paper. And Intel's leaf nodes store rectangles (triangle pairs) anywayXe3 brings STOC bits into hardware raytracing data structures with two levels of sophistication. A basic implementation retains 64B leaf nodes, but creatively finds space to fit 18 extra bits. Intel's QuadLeaf structure represents a merged pair of triangles. Each triangle gets 8 STOC bits, implying four sub-triangles. Another two bits indicate whether the any-hit shader should do STOC emulation in software, potentially letting programmers turn off hardware STOC for debugging. This mode is named \"STOC1\" in co",

        "description": "Intel’s discrete GPU strategy has emphasized add-on features ever since Alchemist launched. Intel’s discrete GPU strategy has emphasized add-on features ever since Alchemist launched. Right from the start, Intel invested heavily in dedicated matrix multiplication units, raytracing accelerators, and hardware video codecs. Battlemage continues that trend. Raytracing deserves attention because raytraced effects are gaining prominence on an increasing number of titles.Here, I’ll be looking at a Cyberpunk 2077 frame rendered on Intel’s Arc B580, with path tracing enabled. As always, I’m focusing on how the architecture handles the workload, rather than absolute performance. Mainstream tech outlets already do an excellent job discussing final performance.Definitely check out the prior article on Meteor Lake’s raytracing implementation, because Intel uses the same raytracing strategy and data structures on Battlemage. Also be sure to check the Battlemage article, which covers the B580’s architecture and some of Intel’s terminology.Cyberpunk 2077 Path Tracing, Lighting Shader?I captured a Cyberpunk 2077 frame at 1080P with no upscaling. Framerate was a bit low at 12 FPS. An occupancy timeline from Intel’s Graphics Performance Analyzer (GPA) shows raytracing calls dominating frame time, though CP2077 surprisingly still spends some time on small rasterization calls.I’m going to focus on the longest duration RT call, which appears to handle some lighting effects. Output from that DispatchRays call shows a very noisy representation of the scene. It’s similar to what you’d get if you stopped a Blender render at an extremely low sample count. Large objects are recognizable, but smaller ones are barely visible.Output from the DispatchRays call, as shown by GPARaytracing AcceleratorBattlemage’s raytracing accelerator (RTA) plays a central role in Intel’s efforts to improve raytracing performance. The RTA receives messages from XVEs to start ray traversal. It then handles traversal without further intervention from the ray generation shader, which terminates shortly after talking to the RTA. BVH data formats are closely tied to the hardware implementation. Intel continues to use 6-wide box nodes and 4-wide triangle nodes, and hasn’t changed that from the previous generation. Both box and triangle nodes continue to be 64B in size, and thus neatly fit into a cacheline.Roughly how the raytracing process works. Any L1 request can miss of courseCompared to Alchemist and Meteor Lake, Battlemage’s RTA increases traversal pipeline count from 2 to 3. That brings box test rate up to three nodes per cycle, or 18 box tests. Triangle intersection test rate doubles as well. More RTA throughput could put more pressure on the memory subsystem, so the RTA’s BVH cache doubles in capacity from 8 KB to 16 KB.During the path tracing DispatchRays call, the B580 processed 467.9M rays per second, or 23.4M rays/sec per Xe Core. Each ray required an average of 39.5 traversal steps. RTAs across the GPU handled just over 16 billion BVH nodes per second, which mostly lines up with traversal step count. Intel uses a short stack traversal algorithm with a restart trail. That reduces stack size compared to a simple depth first search, letting Intel keep the stack in low latency registers. However, it can require restarting traversal from the top using a restart trail. Doing so would mean some upper level BVH nodes get visited more than once by the same ray. That means more pointer chasing accesses, though it looks like the RTA can avoid repeating intersection tests on previously accessed nodes.My impression of how the raytracing unit works. Each traversal pipeline holds ray state, possibly for multiple rays. The frontend allocates rays into the traversal pipelinesGPA’s RT_QUAD_TEST_RAY_COUNT and RT_QUAD_LEAF_RAY_COUNT metrics suggest 1.55% and 1.04% utilization figures for the ray-box and ray-triangle units, respectively. Intel isn’t bound by ray-triangle or ray-box throughput. Even if every node required intersection testing, utilization on the ray-box or ray-triangle units would be below 10%. Battlemage would likely be fine with the two ray-box and single triangle unit from before. I suspect Intel found that duplicating the the traversal pipeline was an easy way to let the RTA keep more work in flight, improving latency hiding.“Percentage of time in which Ray Tracing Frontend is stalled by Traversal”Description of the RT_TRAVERSAL_STALL metric in GPAIntel never documented what they mean by the Ray Tracing Frontend. Perhaps the RTA consists of a frontend that accepts messages from the XVEs, and a traversal backend that goes through the BVH. A stall at the frontend may mean it has received messages from the XVEs, but none of the traversal pipelines in the backend can accept more work. Adding an extra traversal pipeline could be an easy way to process more rays in parallel. And the extra pipeline of course comes with its own ray-box units. Of course, there could be other workloads that benefit from higher intersection test throughput. Intel added an extra triangle test unit, and those aren’t part of the traversal pipelines.BVH CachingBVH traversal is latency sensitive. Intel’s short stack algorithm requires more pointer chasing steps than a simple depth first search, making it even more sensitive to memory latency. But it also creates room for optimization via caching. Using the restart trail involves re-visiting nodes that have been accessed not long ago. A cache can exploit that kind of temporal locality, which is likely why Intel gave the RTA a BVH cache. The Xe Core already has a L1 data cache, but that has to be accessed over the Xe Core’s message fabric. A small cache tightly coupled to the RTA is easier to optimize for latency.Battlemage’s 16 KB BVH cache performs much better than the 8 KB one on prior generations. Besides reducing latency, the BVH cache also reduces pressure on L1 cache. Accessing 16.03 BVH nodes per second requires ~1.03 TB/s of bandwidth. Battlemage’s L1 can handle that easily. But minimizing data movement can reduce power draw. BVH traversal should also run concurrently with miss/hit shaders on the XVEs, and reducing contention between those L1 cache clients is a good thing.Dispatching ShadersHit/miss shader programs provided by the game handle traversal hit/miss results. The RTA launches these shader programs by sending messages back to the Xe Core’s thread dispatcher, which allocates them to XVEs as thread slots become available. The thread dispatcher has two queues for non-pixel shader work, along with a pixel shader work queue. Raytracing work only uses one of the non-pixel shader queues (queue0).81.95% of the time, queue0 had threads queued up. It spent 79.6% of the time stalled waiting to for free thread slots on the XVEs. That suggests the RTAs are generating traversal results faster than the shader array can handle the results.Most of the raytracing related thread launches are any hit or closest hit shaders. Miss shaders are called less often. In total, RTAs across the Arc B580 launched just over a billion threads per second. Even though Intel’s raytracing method launches a lot of shader programs, much of that is contained within the Xe Cores and doesn’t bother higher level scheduling hardware. Just as with Meteor Lake, Intel’s hierarchical scheduling setup is key to making its RTAs work well.Vector ExecutionA GPU’s regular shader units run the hit/miss shader programs that handle raytracing results. During the DispatchRays call, the B580’s XVEs have almost all of their thread slots active. If you could see XVE thread slots as logical cores in Task Manager (1280 of them), you’d see 93.8% utilization. Judging from ALU0 utilization breakdowns, most of the work comes from any hit and closest hit shaders. Miss shader invocations aren’t rare, but perhaps the miss shaders don’t do a lot of work.Just as high utilization in Task Manager doesn’t show how fast your CPU cores are doing work under the hood, high occupancy doesn’t imply high execution unit utilization. More threads simply give the GPU more thread-level parallelism to hide latency with, just like loading more SMT threads on CPU cores. In this workload, even high occupancy isn’t enough to achieve good hardware utilization. Execution unit usage is low across the board, with the ALU0 and ALU1 math pipelines busy less than 20% of the time.Intel can break down thread stall reasons for cycles when the XVE wasn’t able to execute any instructions. Multiple threads can be stalled on different reasons during the same cycle, so counts will add up to over 100%. A brief look shows memory latency is a significant factor, as scoreboard ID stalls top the chart even without adding in SendWr stalls. Modern CPUs and GPUs usually spend a lot of time with execution units idle, waiting for data from memory. But Cyberpunk 2077’s path tracing shaders appear a bit more difficult than usual.Execution latency hurts too, suggesting Cyberpunk 2077’s raytracing shaders don’t have a lot of instruction level parallelism. If the compiler can’t place enough independent instructions between dependent ones, threads will stall. GPUs can often hide execution latency by switching between threads, and the XVEs in this workload do have plenty of thread-level parallelism to work with. But it’s not enough, so there’s probably a lot of long latency instructions and long dependency chains.Finally, threads often stall on instruction fetch. The instruction cache only has a 92.7% hitrate, so some shader programs are taking L1i misses. Instruction cache bandwidth may be a problem too. Each Xe Core’s instruction cache handled 1.11 hits per cycle if I did my math right, so the instruction cache sometimes has to handle more than one access per cycle. If each access is for a 64B cacheline, each Xe Core consumes over 200 GB/s of in",

        "description": "Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) surged over 15% on Thursday as Wall Street welcomed the chipmaker’s appointment on Wednesday of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, just three months after the company ousted former CEO Pat Gelsinger. A widely respected executive with more than 20 years of experience in the semiconductor space, Tan will have a lot on his plate when he takes the helm as Intel’s CEO on March 18. The ailing chipmaker has been struggling to turn around its business after missing out on the generative artificial intelligence boom and losing market share to fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD. Over the last several quarters, Intel has lost market share in data centers and PCs, and lost billions in its manufacturing business. The company’s stock dropped 59.60% of its value last year. On his appointment, Tan said, “I see significant opportunities to remake our business in ways that serve our customers better and create value for our shareholders.” Tan succeeds interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, who were put in place after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out last December by the board, who felt his plan to turn around the company wasn’t working fast enough. Tan is not a newcomer to the Intel ecosystem. During his decade as CEO of Intel supplier and chip-design software company Cadence Design Systems, he doubled revenue, expanded operating margins, and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%. Tan’s appointment comes amid ongoing reports that rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) are in talks to divide the ailing chipmaker’s business into two parts, according to the Wall Street Journal. Broadcom is interested in Intel’s chip-design and marketing business, while TSMC has signaled interest in investing in and studying Intel’s chip plants, potentially as one of several investors with talk of a consortium of chip companies coming in on the deal, including Nvidia (NVDA). However, Tan has signaled he’ll carry on with an existing plan and won’t split out the company’s design and foundry businesses. “We will work hard to restore Intel’s position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,” Tan told employees in a letter that was later published on Intel’s website. “That’s what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future.”",

        "description": "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel’s previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker’s ability to survive as an independent company.This won’t be Tan’s first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel’s board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel’s board in addition to becoming CEO.“Lip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” Intel’s interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel’s stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees—about 15% of its workforce—and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories in Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a “financially responsible manner.” The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple’s 2007 release of the iPhone, and it’s lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel’s troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence—a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech’s hottest commodity.Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel’s $90 billion. Intel’s stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday’s extended trading after Tan’s hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company’s fortunes.While Tan was Cadence Design’s CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company’s stock price increased by 44-fold.Tan’s past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association’s 2022 Robert Noyce Award—an honor named after one of Intel’s co-founders. —Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer",

        "description": "Drivers and kernel-level software can't be translated automatically by Windows. Using a Windows PC with an Arm-based Snapdragon processor in it feels a lot like using a regular-old Intel or AMD PC these days, thanks to the work developers have put in to get their apps running natively on Arm chips and the work Microsoft has done on Windows' Prism technology for translating x86 apps to run on Arm processors. But some of the old compatibility gaps still remain. For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running. Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company announced that it's bringing its Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for Fortnite. Both are coming to Arm PCs \"later this year.\"Read full article Comments",

        "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su.I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images; BIWhen a top analyst skewered AMD's software, CEO Lisa Su called him personally to chat.AMD's AI chips have struggled to compete against Nvidia's dominance, and software is its weakness.Those who know Su told Business Insider she will never settle for second place.What should a CEO do when their company is publicly called out for an inferior product? Many would stay silent. Not AMD CEO Lisa Su.In early February, AMD released new data showing how well its AI chips performed at training large language models, using benchmarks developed by a company called SemiAnalysis. Just weeks earlier, the same group had published a searing review of AMD's tentpole graphics processing unit.The analysts wrote that while the chip looks good on paper, reaching its potential in reality was almost impossible with AMD's existing software. Chief analyst Dylan Patel and the SemiAnalysis team spent five months assessing AMD's GPU, which has struggled to gain market share and mindshare against the dominant player, Nvidia.\"We were hopeful that AMD could emerge as a strong competitor to Nvidia in training workloads, but, as of today, this is unfortunately not the case,\" SemiAnalysis published in December.The next day, Patel got a call from Su. The call was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it lasted 90.\"Feedback is a gift even when it's critical,\" Su tweeted after the call. The new performance data released in February were a punch back in a fight that's far from over.2024 was the year of Lisa Su. She was Time and Chief Executive Magazine's CEO of the year.Last year, AMD outsold Intel in its data center business, overtaking its old rival in the traditional data center world. This became the triumphant apex of Su's first decade as CEO of AMD. Revenue for the whole of 2024 was up 14% year over year — gross profits up 22% — and yet when Su reported the results in February, the stock went down.As Su achieved what many thought impossible and conquered her old foil, Intel, a new one had already presented itself in AI prognosticator Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, Su's cousin born in the same region of Taiwan as her. Shareholders wouldn't let her forget her biggest rival.Whether AMD can meet the seemingly insurmountable challenge of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share may come down to the approaches of two Taiwanese-born, US-educated, distantly-related CEOs.Su has already stated the company's goals. She's leaning into open-source software and beefing up support for large language model training and inference customers. Most importantly, she's raising the bar for AMD's software so that it can better stand up to Nvidia's — since Huang has long professed that software is Nvidia's secret sauce.\"We are still in the very early stages with AI, and we believe there's no one-size-fits-all approach to AI compute,\" an AMD spokesperson told Business Insider. AMD declined to make Su available for an interview.BI spoke with nine people for this story — five of whom have at one point had a personal relationship with Su and three of whom worked under her at AMD. They said that whether in 2007, 2017, or 2027, the stoic, thoughtful, quietly confident executive walking the brightest stages in the tech world is exactly who she seems. Though she may never conquer Nvidia, she won't rest while she's in the number two spot. Her play involves intently listening to partners as well as critics, and it's worked before.AMD CEO Lisa Su's public presentation style has changed since she took over the company in 2014.AMDLisa Su says, 'Why not?'Some early indications suggested that starting at the bottom motivated Su to get to the top.Born in Taiwan and raised in New York, Su intentionally picked the most challenging STEM field she could think of: electrical engineering. After earning her doctorate, she received multiple offers to stay in academia but decided to join Texas Instruments instead, Dimitri Antoniadis, her MIT thesis advisor, told BI. She wanted to manage people and projects, she recently told Stanford business students. After leaving TI for IBM, she was tapped to serve as a technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and CEO.Antoniadis recalled late-night phone conversations with Su when she was at these \"juncture points\" in her career. She left IBM in 2007, spent four and a half years at Freescale Semiconductor, and then came to AMD in 2012.The professor got one such call in late 2014. Su had managed AMD's various business units and operations for nearly three years — deep in the weeds of the entire company yet without the authority to set the overall direction. She called Antoniadis when she was asked to take the CEO job, which meant going after a market dominated by Intel. The original Silicon Valley icon had a market capitalization of over $150 billion and a reputation for ruthlessness. AMD's market cap was just $2 billion.\"At the time, I said, 'Lisa, are you serious? Taking on Intel?' She said, 'Why not?'\" Antoniadis told BI.Su sought multiple opinions on the big decision to head AMD. Lip-Bu Tan, a legendary semiconductor CEO turned investor who will step into the Intel CEO role on March 18, was also on the call list. Tan and Su met years earlier when she was at Freescale Semiconductor, and he was impressed from the start, he told BI.Tan was fully aware of AMD's sad state at the time. The firm had completed two rounds of layoffs since 2011 and pulled out of the processor market. The company needed focus.\"Only the gaming business was doing well. The rest were struggling,\" Tan said. Despite this, he didn't hesitate to recommend the job to Su. He had just orchestrated a revival of a similar magnitude at Cadence Design Systems and knew the opportunity such a turnaround could be.\"The market value was less than $3 billion — you can't go wrong with that. It is so undervalued,\" Tan said of AMD.Su took over AMD on October 8, 2014. A 7% staff cut proceeded, and Su set out to make long-term bets and win back customers. Tan said Su soon had top tech execs like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Dell COO Jeff Clarke trusting her, mainly due to her hands-on style. Even for routine annual business reviews, Su knows all the numbers and listens intently to concerns, sources said.\"They love her. She is very engaged — very involved,\" Tan said.Su has evolved her style over her 10 years as CEO of AMD. She's somewhat less stoic, makes jokes onstage, wears brighter colors, has more perfectly coiffed hair, and has come to appreciate Christian Louboutin heels. AMD declined to comment on these details.\"I am not surprised at all where she is right now. I truly expected it,\" Antoniadis told BI.AMD's market cap has grown to about $160 billion as of Wednesday — much higher than its $2 billion market cap when Su first started. This month, all AI stocks have taken a dive amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policy shifts.Now, Su has a new miracle to perform.Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.AMDSu v. HuangIn 2018, Su sat with a handful of Wall Street analysts in a private meeting space near the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest tech conferences of the year, bustled in the massive building's halls.Su was just over three years into her job as CEO of AMD, and the company's stock hovered above just $10 per share.The analysts in that Las Vegas conference room had a lot of advice for the then 48-year-old CEO, according to a person present, who asked not to be named since the session was private. The room was full of men eager to tell Su how to seize on her progress and take AMD to the next level. There was chatter in the nerdier accelerated computing circles that machine learning was ready to scale, and the analysts weren't sure AMD was seeing the signs.Su took it all in and politely thanked everyone. She knew accelerated computing would change the world as early as 2017, she has since said in interviews. The graphics processing unit made that possible.At the time, the entertainment industry used them for gaming and graphics rendering. While AMD has designed this kind of hardware for two decades, Nvidia's Huang beat the entire tech industry to the punch when he identified the AI opportunity for GPUs and started building software to help it spread. Since ChatGPT's birth, Nvidia and AMD have been in an epic race — only Nvidia had a massive head start.Both Huang and Su are notoriously hardworking — late nights and weekends are a given.But Huang is a showman. He dominates a stage whether it be at the front of a boardroom or a concert arena. Su is less flashy. She rarely, if ever, raises her voice, and her business strategy echoes that quiet, inexhaustible, confident consistency, sources said.\"You know she's in charge, but she's also a very quiet leader,\" said Jodi Shelton, cofounder and CEO of the Global Semiconductor Alliance. Shelton recalled an intimate dinner at Su's Texas home with just the CEO and her husband, Daniel Lin, where Su asked most of the questions.\"She doesn't need to interject when someone's speaking. She doesn't have to be the loudest person in the room,\" Shelton continued.Onstage, Su often paces, making measured announcements. At team meetings, she drills for answers about what needs to be done next and delegates tasks, personally reviewing AMD's GPU distribution on spreadsheets, the AMD employees said.In a world where CEOs like former Intel leader Pat Gelsinger have announced plans such as five nodes in four years and fell short in execution, AMD has slowly marched forward. Even Nvidia's yearly cadence of new GPU generations has hit production and installation snags. Su is wary of overpromising and underexecuting, several sources said. Execution is non-negotiable.\"That's not very easy for people to do for such a long time,\" Lamini founder Sharon Zhou, who has committed to AMD hardware over Nvidia, told BI. \"Which is why I think she presents the main threat to",

        "description": "Tan will start as CEO on March 18, taking over from interim co-CEOs. After a little over three months, Intel has a new CEO to replace ousted former CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel's board announced that Lip-Bu Tan will begin as Intel CEO on March 18th, taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zisner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. Gelsinger was booted from the CEO position by Intel's board on December 2 after several quarters of losses, rounds of layoffs, and canceled or spun-off side projects. Gelsinger sought to turn Intel into a foundry company that also manufactured chips for fabless third-party chip design companies, putting it into competition with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), Samsung, and others, a plan that Intel said it was still committed to when it let Gelsinger go. Intel said that Zisner would stay on as executive vice president and CFO, and Johnston Holthaus would remain CEO of the Intel Products Group, which is mainly responsible for Intel's consumer products. These were the positions both executives held before serving as interim co-CEOs.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "TSMC reportedly approached a handful of US AI chipmakers to potentially operate Intel's foundry in a joint venture. Visitors taking photofs at a TSMC booth at the 2024 World Semiconductor Congress in Nanjing, China.CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesIntel stock is moving up on Wednesday on reports of a foundry joint venture with major chip makers. Reuters reported that TSMC is discussing a joint venture to operate Intel's foundry.The Taiwanese chipmaker approached Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom for the JV. The move: Intel jumped 5.5% to $20.8 per share on Wednesday. The stock is still down 1.35% this year.The chart: Why: On Wednesday, Reuters reported that TSMC and a handful of other AI chipmakers are considering a joint venture to operate Intel's factories.Sources told the outlet that the Taiwanese semiconductor giant approached Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom with the idea. Talks are still in the early stages. TSMC would run operations but own no more than 50% of Intel's foundry.A separate source told Reuters that Qualcomm is also involved in discussions with TSMC.What it means: TSMC's involvement follows President Donald Trump's request that the flagship chipmaker help revive Intel's struggling business, according to a Reuters source with knowledge of the private talks.If a deal is reached, it could mark a positive reversal for Intel's fortunes of late. Shares of the US chipmaker have shed nearly 56% in the last year. Intel reported $18.8 billion in net losses in 2024, while navigating the AI boom, layoffs, and manufacturing delays.But interest from other US chipmakers has been mounting. A report last week found that Nvidia and Broadcom were running manufacturing tests at Intel's foundry, and the company saw its stock soar in early February on comments from Vice President JD Vance pledging to boost US chipmaking.

        "description": "Nvidia's 50-series refresh has been pretty conservative so far. Nvidia has launched all of the GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs that it announced at CES, at least technically—whether you're buying from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel, it's nearly impossible to find any of these new cards at their advertised prices right now. But hope springs eternal, and newly leaked specs for GeForce RTX 5060 and 5050-series cards suggest that Nvidia may be announcing these lower-end cards soon. These kinds of cards are rarely exciting, but Steam Hardware Survey data shows that these xx60 and xx50 cards are what the overwhelming majority of PC gamers are putting in their systems. The specs, posted by a reliable leaker named Kopite and reported by Tom's Hardware and others, suggest a refresh that's in line with what Nvidia has done with most of the 50-series so far. Along with a move to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, the 5060 GPUs each come with a small increase to the number of CUDA cores, a jump from GDDR6 to GDDR7, and an increase in power consumption, but no changes to the amount of memory or the width of the memory bus. The 8GB versions, in particular, will probably continue to be marketed primarily as 1080p cards.Read full article Comments",

        "description": "Malaysia design deal with Arm; strong IC sales; CHIPS Act clawback clause; Allegro spurns offer; TSMC $100B U.S. deal; Intel's chain of custody; Microchip restructures; auto RISC-V. The post Chip Industry Week In Review appeared first on Semiconductor Engineering. The Malaysian government signed a deal with Arm to kickstart a chip design ecosystem. Until now, Malaysia has focused on packaging and test. Adding chip design represents a major change in focus. The country will pay SoftBank $250 million over 10 years for Arm’s chip design IP and train 10,000 engineers. Global chip sales reached $56 billion in January, up nearly 18% from the same period in 2024, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Sales increased almost 51% in the Americas. Meanwhile, the silicon wafers market is projected to grow ~7% in 2025, with even stronger gains in 2026, versus a 4% decline in 2024, per TECHCET. Despite the Trump administration’s lack of enthusiasm for the bipartisan 2022 CHIPS Act, more than 85% of the Congress-approved direct funding is now in binding contracts, and in many cases construction already has begun. The law continues to have bi-partisan support. A new CSIS brief points to national security guardrails that are part of the CHIPS Act, allowing a clawback of funding if a recipient does a material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity, joint research, or technology licensing with some foreign entities that is related to critical technology. The report notes there is risk that could further push China’s design-out efforts. Reacting to TSMC‘s announcement to spend an incremental $100 billion in Arizona, Taiwan’s government denied the move ‘Americanizes’ TSMC or had anything to do with tariffs. The company also said the necessary approvals from the government are pending. TSMC already had planned to invest $65 billion in the U.S. The expansion includes plans for three new fabs, two advanced packaging plants, and an R&D team center. Allegro Microsystems rejected onsemi’s $35.10 per share cash buyout proposal. Intel Products launched an Assured Supply Chain program, providing a “chain of custody” of each chip’s journey through the manufacturing process. Special Report: Automotive OEMs are wrestling with a stack of changes that affect every part of their business and technology, from threats of tariffs and shifting geopolitical alliances, to new vehicle architectures, tighter market windows, and a fundamental reordering of relationships and priorities between OEMs and their suppliers.

President Trump will reportedly meet with top U.S. tech companies facing tariff-related pressure. The CEOs of IBM, Intel, Qualcomm and HP will gather at the White House on Monday (March 10), Bloomberg News reported Thursday (March 6), citing sources familiar with the matter and a spokesperson for HP. “Some of the topics top-of-mind for our leadership team are trade policy and U.S. manufacturing,” that spokesperson said. As Bloomberg notes, the Trump administration is pushing several policy changes that could threaten computer hardware makers. For example, new tariffs on manufacturing centers like China could drive up costs and hinder supply chains. In addition, the report added, tech companies are also seeking clarity about possible restrictions on their exports of technology for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are being constructed around the globe. The meeting is happening as businesses from a range of sectors are feeling pressure from the tariffs, imposed on Canada, Mexico and China and covering a range of goods. For example, a report Wednesday (March 5) by the Wall Street Journal found that toy companies are bracing themselves for the impact of the tariffs. These companies are concerned about where they will source their products, how they will stay on top of growing costs and how consumers will react to higher prices. While some larger toymakers are renegotiating with vendors and shifting production to other countries, smaller companies have fewer options and could be forced to absorb the added costs if they cannot pass them along to buyers in the form of higher prices. Meanwhile, Best Buy said earlier this week that tariffs on China could have a negative effect of about one point of comparable sales if they stayed in place for a full year. “While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,” CEO Corie Barry said during the company’s earnings call. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that at least 60% of CFOs see their companies facing greater uncertainty and challenges due to the tariffs. “Reconfiguring supply chains is no panacea, as it costs time and money,” PYMNTS wrote recently. “Moreover, domestic supply chains would become more competitive, as near-shoring or onshoring materials would mean greater competition for suppliers on higher demand and, thus, supply crunches.” The post Trump Sets Meeting With Tech CEOs As Tariff Pressures Set In appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

The World’s Best CPU for AI As AI adoption continues to accelerate, organizations are projected to spend up to $153 billion on generative AI (GenAI) by 2027, with total spending for machine learning and analytics reaching $361 billion, according to IDC. Intel Xeon 6 is optimized to capture a significant share of this growing market, delivering leadership performance in traditional machine learning, smaller GenAI models and GPU-accelerated workloads in a host CPU capacity. Intel is collaborating with silicon, software and solution providers to enable the AI ecosystem, reinforcing Xeon 6 as the go-to CPU for AI systems. Leadership Performance for Modern Telecommunications Networks With 5G and AI poised to transform connectivity, traditional network optimization strategies are no longer sufficient. To unlock the full potential of next-gen networks and connectivity, telecom operators are adopting technologies like network slicing, AI-powered radio controllers and cloud-native architectures. By leveraging Intel’s unified Xeon platform, operators can dynamically optimize workloads, reduce costs and build scalable, flexible networks that adapt in real time to changing customer demands, traffic patterns and market shifts. Key performance highlights of the Intel Xeon 6 SoC include: Webroot CSI upload model inference is up to 4.3x faster than Intel Xeon D-2899NT10. AI RAN performance per core is improved by up to 3.2x compared with the previous generation with vRAN Boost11. A 38-core system supports int8 inferencing of up to 38 simultaneous camera streams on a video edge server12. New Advanced Ethernet Solutions Intel also unveiled two new Ethernet controller and network adapter product lines to address the growing demands of enterprise, telecommunications, cloud, high performance computing (HPC), edge and AI applications.

        "description": "Intel is rising on a report that two leading AI names are running manufacturing tests using Intel's chip-making technology. credit should read LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesIntel stock rose nearly 6% on Monday on a report Nvidia and Broadcom could use the firm's tech. Reuters reported that the two chip giants are running manufacturing tests at Intel's foundry.The move would be an important endorsement for the embattled hardware firm.The move: Intel rose 6% to $25.18 per share on Monday morning. The jump puts the stock on track to recoup losses after a drop of about 4.5% last week. The chart: Why: Sources told Reuters that Nvidia and Broadcom, two leading chipmakers, are running manufacturing tests with Intel. If successful, this could be the hardware company's first step to unlocking lucrative manufacturing deals with two firms at the heart of the artificial intelligence trade. Both tests utilize Intel's 18A manufacturing process, used to develop advanced AI processors and other high-grade tech. Advanced Micro Devices is also looking into Intel's 18A process for its own needs, Reuters added.What it means: Rising interest from top AI chipmakers would be a strong endorsement for Intel, and could help shore up a stock that has dropped well below last year's highs. While the stock is up about 18% year-to-date, it has fallen 43% in a year. Layoffs and buyouts have pushed investors away from the tech giant over the past year, a retreat made worse as the company fell behind on AI. Most recently, the chipmaker announced that plans for a manufacturing plant in Ohio have been delayed until 2030 — initially, it was to start operating as soon as this year.While the Nvidia and Broadcom tests are a needed vote of confidence, it's not a guaranteed win for Intel. Testing can last months and may still result in disappointing conclusions. According to Reuters, that much occurred last year, with Broadcom executives let down by a batch of tests at the Intel foundry.The latest move is also a fresh boost for the company after another bright spot in February after US Vice President JD Vance pledged to boost US chip production.

The intended and explicit symbolism was that Altera was making a great leap forward by becoming independent. Intel purchased Altera at the end of 2015 for $16.7 billion and renamed the organization. It became the Intel Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). The acquisition did not turn out to be a marriage made in heaven due to the mismatch between Intel’s top priority, introducing and shipping CPUs, and Intel PSG’s mission: introducing and shipping FPGAs. I worked for Intel PSG’s marketing group during the last few years of PSG’s existence and can attest to this priority mismatch. The person overseeing Altera’s re-emergence as an independent FPGA vendor is CEO Sandra Rivera. According to her official Intel biography, Rivera previously “led Intel’s Data Center and AI Group, where she guided development of data center products, including Intel Xeon processors, Intel Max and Flex series graphic processors, Intel Gaudi AI accelerators and FPGA products.” Notice how the FPGAs were tacked onto the tail end of Rivera’s bio. I don’t think that’s by accident. Rivera shouldered a major turnaround when she became Altera’s CEO, and because of the efforts she’s made in the past year, I named her “FPGA Person of the Year” in my January FPGA Awards article. (See “The First Annual FPGA Awards – the Fibbies – celebrating 40 years of FPGAs.”) Not long after that article appeared, I received an email telling me that Rivera would like to speak with me via teleconference. We spoke for 30 minutes on February 6, and the relevant parts of that conversation appear below. To start, I asked Rivera to review Altera’s past year, since declaring its independence from Intel, and she gave her perspective: Rivera: “Well, I think it’s gone quite well, actually. We are pretty energized and excited about being smaller and more nimble. The distance between making a decision and executing it is a lot less in a smaller entity than it is in a large complex organization. The time to decision making is faster. We don’t have as many layers and governance. That’s necessary, maybe sometimes a little unnecessary, in a larger organization, but that’s the way of life in a large, complex enterprise… “You know, the focus has been really from the beginning, ‘How we get back to better execution?’” Rivera then said that Altera has been innovating well for many years, in her opinion, but said that Altera’s execution was not what it needs to be in recent years. Rivera: “So we are very focused on a streamlined road map, with a clear approach in terms of a waterfall strategy for high-end, the mid-range, and low-end FPGAs, and we’re very excited to be bringing new products to market.” I then asked Rivera to elaborate on Altera’s roadmap. Rivera: “One of the things that we did, more than three years ago now, is we decided that we were going to have a full-stack approach, a waterfall approach, to the roadmap. We built out the Agilex portfolio at the high end of the roadmap as well as Agilex 5, the big middle, and then Agilex 3 [the low end of the Agilex line] … “When I really came in full time in 2024, we still had a number of projects on the roadmap that I would say were probably more tactical, shorter term in nature, but that didn’t [mesh with] the idea that we would have greater IP reuse and more engineering leverage out of the investments that we make and by getting to a waterfall strategy, which also translates into lower risk, lower cost, and faster time to execution. “So, the strategy around innovation and execution is tied to a roadmap that is consistent, where we have an approach that leverages IP from top to bottom and is anchored on fewer processes and technologies, where we can use IP in different instantiations of the products across the entire portfolio of the roadmap.” Because she’d introduced this concept of a waterfall strategy that leveraged IP up and down the product line, I asked Rivera to elaborate on that idea: Rivera: “So, two things, Steve. What IP reuse means is that we can characterize an IP on a process technology, and through chips and packaging decisions and different SKU options, utilize that Investment across more products and more areas of the road map. “Then, secondly, the consistency of the software stack is critically important, as you know quite well, and is not so obvious for folks that aren’t [as familiar with FPGAs]. We who are immersed in FPGA technology, as you are, know the FPGA business is really a software business. While the vehicle for monetization is the silicon, it really is the software stack, the tool chain, and the tool flows that customers invest in over periods of time. It becomes so difficult to port over from design to design, and that is one of the areas that we’ve been very, very focused on in terms of the consistency of the portfolio.” [Note: You can look at the glass half empty or half full here. Half empty means you’re locked into an FPGA vendor by the design tools. Half full means you only need to hike up the learning curve on the tools once. Rivera continued:] Rivera: “Even when we were looking at our overall AI strategy and how we were going to implement it, we took a very different approach from the competition [specifically AMD/Xilinx] in terms of infusing the [programmable logic] fabric with AI capability that would let you scale up or scale down for as much AI as you wanted, as opposed to having a hardened block with vector engines. We really went with the idea that we’re creating a programmable logic device, a spatial architecture, and the software tool chain around it. That is what we want to provide to customers, so that adding AI/machine learning is similar to adding any other IP with the same tool flows in a Quartus software stack. “The competition [again referring specifically to AMD/Xilinx] has a different AI tool flow that needs to be integrated with the FPGA flow, which adds more complexity and has more of a hardened block approach. For us, that software consistency and the IP reuse really are the hallmarks of how we’re planning out our roadmap and executing to the strategy.” I then asked Rivera about singling out AMD/Xilinx as the sole FPGA competitor in Altera’s sights. She replied: Rivera: “Our vision is to be the number one FPGA solutions provider in the world, and that’s a multi-year, many year journey. We always think about the number one player as our competition. Not that the other players – and clearly you know the folks that are playing at the low end – have done a very good job there. But we very much see ourselves as a full-stack, cloud-to-edge provider, and so we typically look at the number one player in the market as the competition, and we benchmark our performance, our innovation, and our differentiation against them.” [Note: Here, Rivera acknowledges that FPGA vendors Lattice and Microsemi have done a good job at increasing their market share at the low end and with mid-range FPGAs, but at the same time, by saying Altera wants to be a “full-stack” player, Rivera’s acknowledging that Altera intends to win back some mid-range and low-end business with its Agilex 5 and Agilex 3 FPGA families.] I then asked Rivera to give Altera a grade for the company as it stands today. She said: Rivera: “Well, I think that if you ask our customers and ecosystem partners, Steve, they will see us living into our values, which is very much around customer obsession. You know, results driven. And of course, always on a foundation of innovation, but with speed and agility being more of the differentiated capability that we have [now], versus when we were part of a larger organization. “…We’re hungry and leaning into this mission around being number one. So, we have work to do. Clearly, there’s nothing about the FPGA business that’s fast or transactional in terms of driving growth and success in delivering products to market. “But there was a lot of momentum as we left the year [2024]. If you listened to the Intel earnings call last week, you can see we had sequential growth quarter on quarter, every quarter last year. We really did outperform relative to the competition in terms of our growth trajectory and gross margin and operating margin… “And we are bringing exciting new products to market with Agilex 5 and Agilex 3 that have been in planning for quite some time that we’re excited to bring to market to meet our customer requirements. “We are not perfect. We still have a lot of work to do to get that execution engine going the way that we want, to ensure that our ‘do/say’ ratio with our customers is better than it’s been, meaning that we make commitments, we meet commitments, and customers can count on us to show up when we say we’ll show up. This mantra around delivering the highest quality products on schedule as committed to the customers is something that drives us. But it’s always a journey of never-ending improvement.” [Because it was a new term for me, I asked Rivera to confirm that the “do/say” ratio was the ratio of things done divided by the number of things you say you’re going to do. She confirmed. That’s what she meant.] I then asked Rivera about Altera’s big challenges for the next twelve months. She replied: Rivera: “We have",
